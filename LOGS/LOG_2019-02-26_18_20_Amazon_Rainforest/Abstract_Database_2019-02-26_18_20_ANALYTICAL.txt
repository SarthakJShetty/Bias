Abstract: 'Despite widespread deforestation the forests of Amazonia still cover more than 5 million km2 and may host up to a quarter of the world\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial species (Dirzo and Raven 2003)\xe2\x80\x94many of which are still undocumented. Conservation of these forests is important, not just for the biodiversity they contain, but also for the vital ecosystem services they provide. Historically, the greatest threat to Amazonia has been conversion to agriculture, initially through small-scale farming and, more recently, also through well-capitalized organizations producing agricultural and forestry products for global markets (Rudel et al. 2009).

Abstract: 'A solute mass balance for a 23.4 ha catchment of undisturbed rainforest in the central Amazon Basin was computed from detailed measurements of water and solute fluxes via rainfall, streamflow, and subsurface outflow over an annual cycle. Annual atmospheric deposition fluxes are lower than previously reported among mass balance studies conducted in the Amazon. Nutrient export fluxes are lower than previously reported for the Amazon, despite the fact that export fluxes via flow paths not previously measured were included. Given that climatic conditions were representative of a one in 10 wet year, the ecosystem was expected to show a net loss of nutrients rather than net gain. Instead, an excess of nutrient inputs via rainfall over ecosystem outflows was detected, ranging in annual quantities from 0.30 to 0.50 of the measured input. Among several mechanisms that could reconcile this budget, two are supported by the information presently available while two others cannot be evaluated without further research. Interannual variability in the amount of water available for runoff at the spatial scale of small catchments varies by a factor of two, in contrast to rainfall variability of \xc2\xb120%, and may be a critical control on the apparent changes in ecosystem storage detected by annual-scale nutrient budgets in rainforests. Entrainment of materials from the terrestrial ecosystem to the atmosphere, including particulates containing elements which do not exist as gases, may be a particularly important loss pathway in rainforests existing on deeply weathered or nutrient poor soils.'

Abstract: 'Severe droughts may alter the reproductive phenology of tropical tree species, but our understanding of these effects has been hampered by confounded variation in drought, light and other factors during natural drought events. We used a large-scale experimental reduction of throughfall in an eastern-central Amazon forest to study the phenological response to drought of an abundant subcanopy tree, Coussarea racemosa. We hypothesized that drought would alter the production and the timing of reproduction, as well as the number of viable fruits. The study system comprised two 1-ha plots in the Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil: a dry plot where 50% of incoming precipitation (80% throughfall) was diverted from the soil during the six-month wet season beginning in January 2000, and a wet plot that received natural rainfall inputs. Fruit production of C. racemosa was quantified every 15\xc2\xa0days using 100\xc2\xa0litter traps (0.5\xc2\xa0m2) in each plot. The production of new leaves and flowers was recorded monthly for C. racemosa individuals. Soil water, pre-dawn leaf water potential and solar radiation were measured to help interpret phenological patterns. Over the \xe2\x88\xbc3.5-year period (April 2000 through December 2003), total fruit production remained similar between plots, declining by 12%. In 2003, production was four times higher in both plots than in previous years. In the dry plot, fruit fall shifted 40 and 60\xc2\xa0days later into the dry season in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Total fruit fall dry mass production was variable across the study period. Foliage and flower production coincided with peak irradiance early in the dry season until delays in flowering appeared in the dry plot in 2002 and 2003. Plant water stress, through its influence on leaf developmental processes and, perhaps, inhibition of photosynthesis, appears to have altered both the timing of fruit fall and the quality and number of seeds produced.'

Abstract: 'Stomatal functioning is modulated by several factors and, in most circumstances, stomatal aperture declines with increasing leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference (VPDL) and temperature, but stomatal functioning under the humid conditions of the tropical rainforest understory has been scarcely investigated.

We\xc2\xa0measured gas-exchange in four saplings of Guarea carinata (1\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0m tall). On each plant, stomatal conductance\xc2\xa0(g s), VPDL and leaf temperature were measured continuously at 3-min intervals during 24\xc2\xa0h. We used a constant irradiance of 50\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921 and nearly constant relative humidity (75.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.9%). Within the leaf chamber, leaf temperature over plants varied from 25.8 to 30.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and VPDL from 0.62 to 0.93\xc2\xa0kPa. Contrary to expectations, g s increased with the\xc2\xa0increase in\xc2\xa0leaf temperature and VPDL, and throughout the 24-h cycle, g s\xc2\xa0was maximum (0.123\xc2\xa0mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921) at midday when temperatures were higher and minimum (0.016\xc2\xa0mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921) after midnight, when the lower temperatures were recorded. There was a positive relationship between\xc2\xa0g s and both leaf temperature (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001) and VPDL (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001). If global temperature continues to increase as predicted by models, the direct increase in g s\xc2\xa0of saplings associated with an increase in temperature can be nullified if global warming negatively affects the water balance of plants (e.g. Guarea carinata) in this part of the Amazon.'

Abstract: 'Terrestrial oviposition with free-living aquatic larvae is a common reproductive mode used by amphibians within the central Amazonian rainforest. We investigated the factors presently associated with diversity of microhabitats (waterbodies) that may be maintaining the diversity of reproductive modes. In particular, desiccation, predation by fish, competition with other anurans and water quality were examined in 11 waterbodies as possible forces leading to the evolution of terrestrial oviposition. Predation experiments demonstrated that fish generally do not eat anuran eggs, and that predacious tadpoles and dytiscid beetle larvae are voracious predators of anuran eggs. The percentage of species with terrestrial oviposition was only weakly correlated with the occurrence of pond drying, pH and oxygen concentration, suggesting that anurans in this tropical community are able to use the range of water quality available for egg development. There was a tendency for terrestrial oviposition to be associated with the number of species of tadpoles using the waterbody, but we consider this to be spurious as there was no obvious competitive mechanism that could result in this relationship. The percentage of species with terrestrial oviposition was significantly positively related to our index of egg predation pressure, and negatively related to our index of fish biomass. Egg predation pressure was also negatively related to the index of fish biomass. These results allow us to discount as improbable the hypothesis that predation by fish on anuran eggs was an important selective pressure leading to terrestrial oviposition in this community. The strong positive relationship between terrestrial oviposition and our index of egg predation pressure indicates that these predators have exerted, and are exerting, a significant selective pressure for terrestrial oviposition. The strong negative relationship between the occurrence of fish and the egg predators suggests the surprising conclusion that the presence of fish actually protects aquatic anuran eggs from predation in this tropical system, and allows aquatic oviposition to dominate only in those waterbodies with moderate to high densities of fish. Our results suggest that terrestrial oviposition is a \xe2\x80\x9cfixed predator avoidance\xe2\x80\x9d trait.'

Abstract: 'This study examined how root growth and morphology were affected by variation in soil moisture at four Amazon rainforest sites with contrasting vegetation and soil types. Mean annual site root mass, length and surface area growth ranged between 3\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xa0t ha\xe2\x88\x921, 2\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0km m\xe2\x88\x922 and 8\xe2\x80\x9312\xc2\xa0m2 m\xe2\x88\x922 respectively. Mean site specific root length and surface area varied between 8\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0km kg\xe2\x88\x921 and 24\xe2\x80\x9334\xc2\xa0m2 kg\xe2\x88\x921. Growth of root mass, length and surface area was lower when soil water was depleted (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) while specific root length and surface area showed the opposite pattern (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). These results indicate that changes in root length and surface area per unit mass, and pulses in root growth to exploit transient periods of high soil water availability may be important means for trees in this ecosystem to increase nutrient and water uptake under seasonal and longer-term drought conditions.'

Abstract: 'Biophysical and biochemical plant foliage parameters play a key role in assessing vegetation health. Those plant parameters determine the spectral reflectance and transmittance properties of vegetation; therefore, hyperspectral remote sensing, particularly imaging spectroscopy, can provide estimates of leaf and canopy chemical properties. Based on the relationship between spectral response and biochemical/biophysical properties of the leaves and canopies, the PROSPECT radiative transfer model simulates the interaction of light with leaves. In this study, more than 1100 leaf samples from the Amazon forest of Ecuador were collected at several study sites, some of which are affected by petroleum pollution, and across the vertical profile of the forest. For every sample, field spectroscopy at leaf level was conducted with a spectroradiometer. The goal of this study was to assess leaf optical properties of polluted and unpolluted rainforest canopies across the vertical profile and identify vegetation stress expressed in changes of biophysical and biochemical properties of vegetation. An ANOVA followed by Holme\xe2\x80\x99s multiple comparisons of means and a principal component analysis showed that photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll and carotenoids have significantly lower levels across the vertical profile of the forest, particularly in sites affected by petroleum pollution. On the other hand, foliar water content showed significantly higher levels in the polluted site. Those findings are symptoms of vegetation stress caused by reduced photosynthetic activity and consequently decreased transpiration and water-use efficiency of the plants. Cross-comparison between SPAD-502 chlorophyll content meter index and chlorophyll content showed strong positive correlation coefficients (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.71 and r 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.51) which suggests that using the SPAD-502 chlorophyll index itself is sensitive enough to detect vegetation stress in a multispecies tropical forest. Therefore, the SPAD-502 can be used to assess chlorophyll content of vegetation across polluted and non-polluted sites at different canopy layers. The results presented in this paper contribute to the very limited literature on field spectroscopy and radiative transfer models applied to the vertical profile of the Amazon forest.'

Abstract: 'Man-made forest edges affect tree community composition and structure, but there is little information on the effects of natural edges. To detect tree community changes related to natural edges, we investigated a terrestrial forest island, bordered by grassland and mangrove landscapes, on the Brazilian Amazon coast. Forest structure and tree species composition were examined in 10-m-wide and 100-m-long plots from the forest edge to the interior in relation to both landscapes (8 grassland and 4 mangrove plots). Elevation and soil quality did not reveal strong spatial variability; tidal inundation established a boundary for forest expansion without influencing the forest interior. The tree community consisted of 82 species. No distinct changes in vegetation structure and composition with distance from the border were detected. Ordination procedures gave weak indications for shifts in community composition with distance from the edge and in respect to edge type. Single species occurred more frequently either close to or more distant from the grassland-forest interface. No such tendencies were detected at the mangrove-terrestrial forest interface, probably because the lack of structural differences between terrestrial forest and mangrove canopies did not permit the establishment of edge-related microclimatic gradients. Due to the isolation of the forest island and the harsh coastal environment, the tree community was dominated by generalist species which are well adapted to the conditions at the grassland\xe2\x80\x93forest edge. Furthermore, the patchy distribution of frequent species and the high number of rare species made it difficult to detect spatial patterns related to the forest edge.'

Abstract: 'The remote headwater areas of the Amazon rainforest are home to many Indigenous groups who prefer not to encounter and establish relationships with outsiders. These people have not been exposed to many everyday, infectious, Old World diseases and are therefore particularly susceptible to them, with extremely high morbidity and mortality rates. Recent Peruvian governments have encouraged the large-scale exploitation of timber, gas, and petrol in the Amazon. These economic interests have greatly increased pressure on previously remote areas, many of which are home to Indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. The Nahua and Nanti established direct relations with outsiders in the last 20 years and have experienced major changes in health status, social disruption, and bereavement as a consequence. The description of some of their epidemics highlights these populations\xe2\x80\x99 vulnerability to introduced diseases. Understood as the result of both \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexternal\xe2\x80\x9d factors, this vulnerability is a combination of their high susceptibility and of social changes resulting from increased resource pressure on their lands. The experiences of the peoples in the Kugapakori Nahua Reserve demonstrate the effects that resource extraction activities (both surface and subsoil) can have on local populations, not only when conducted in their lands (as in the case of the Nahua) but also when they take place downstream of their territories (as in the case of the Nanti). Because their susceptibility cannot be significantly altered immediately or without affecting their rights, the responsibility lies with local and national governments to limit exploitation on their lands. Not to do so constitutes a violation of isolated peoples\xe2\x80\x99 rights to life and health.'

Abstract: 'With the constant deforestation observed in the Amazon region in recent decades, changes in local climates are unavoidable. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand such climate changes by evaluating differences in precipitation (PRP), evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) between forested and deforested areas in the Brazilian Amazonia. Eight areas (four forested and four deforested) that maintained their land cover over a period of 15\xc2\xa0years (2000\xe2\x80\x932014) were selected using PRODES (Legal Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project) Digital\xe2\x80\x99s remote sensing database. The PRP data were retrieved from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM, resolution of 0.25\xc2\xb0), and the data of ET and PET were obtained from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor (MODIS, resolution of 0.05\xc2\xb0). The differences among PRP, ET and PET in each area were calculated using a regression model. The results show that ET was the only variable which presented a statistically significant difference between forested and deforested areas, mainly due to an intense decrease at the deforested sites during the dry season. Regarding PRP, a modest increase was observed on small areas, probably due to changes in local atmospheric dynamics, but on large areas decrease in PRP was noted. Nevertheless, in both cases there were no statistically significant differences between forested and deforested areas. PET presented a slightly increase value over deforested areas during the dry season, but not statistically significant as well.'

Abstract: ' Annona (Annonaceae) is an important source of fruits in the Brazilian Cerrado and the Amazon Rainforest. Some Annona species are widely commercialized as fresh fruit or as frozen pulp. Seeds are accustomedly discarded. Our main goal was to analyze fatty acids profile from seeds of A. crassiflora and A. coriacea from Cerrado, A. montana from Amazon Forest, and three cultivars (A. cherimola cv. Madeira, A. cherimola x A. squamosa cv. Pink\xe2\x80\x99s Mammonth and A. cherimola x A. squamosa cv. Gefner). The total oil yield ranged between 20 and 42% by weight of dry mass. The A cherimola x A. squamosa cv. Gefner has significantly higher total lipid yield than all other samples. 100\xc2\xa0g of fruit of this species present 6-8\xc2\xa0g of seeds. Considering the fruit production of Chile (over 221 ton of fruits/year), more than 1300 ton of seed/year could be obtained, which could provide at least 200 ton of seed oil. Oleic acid was predominant for most samples, but for A. montana linoleic acid was the most abundant FA. Phenotypic variation on FAME profile was observed. These new data are an urgent requirement for supporting conservation programs, mainly for Cerrado areas in Brazil.'

Abstract: 'The single-frequency Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (launched in April, 2012) is designed to provide a wide variety of imaging options compared to the prevailing SAR missions. The scale of the calibration task for the RISAT-1 mission is increased with the inclusion of multiple beams and polarizations (single, dual and quad) along with circular/hybrid polarization capabilities, for the first time from space. Significant efforts have been made in the evolution of SAR processor for the provision of radiometrically and geometrically calibrated products to the users. After the commissioning phase, RISAT-1 was put into routine operations in Oct. 2012. Since then extensive beam coverage of Amazon rainforest in various modes was carried out to evaluate the calibration parameters and SAR processor performance. Subsequently, the processor version 1.2.0 was improved to version 1.3.0 and with further modifications to version 1.4.0. This article details the analysis carried out at each processor version, by quality evaluation team, to quantify the parameter behaviour and to give feedback on the processor performance to the SAR processor team. The various radiometric quality parameters evaluated and monitored are shape of the antenna pattern, gamma-naught, backscattering coefficient (sigma-naught), speckle index, radiometric resolution and Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ). Data studied for the analysis is in Single Look Complex (SLC) for stripmap mode and multilook (Ground range) for ScanSAR and stripmap mode in dual and circular polarizations. The performance of version 1.4.0 for all the beams (near-to-far) is found to be consistent and meeting the mission specifications for the product.'

Abstract: '\nIn the present work, we have considered the vulnerability of some rare tree species to human disturbances in a high biodiversity tropical region. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the combined effect of deforestation and artificial flooding of the large Jirau hydroelectric reservoir on potential distribution areas of 13 locally rare tree species in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We performed species distribution modeling (SDM) by using the environmental distance algorithm. Based on these models, we found new sites and subsequently applied rapid ecological assessment to collect further species occurrence data. Additional SDMs were carried out using MaxEnt to determine the potential distribution areas of these rare species. We found that artificial flooding and deforestation caused combined losses of potential distribution areas of rare tree species between 8 and 39% of the total area. The most vulnerable species were Semaphyllanthe megistocaula (K. Krause) L. Andersson (Rubiaceae) (39%), Chrysophyllum colombianum (Aubr\xc3\xa9v.) T.D. Penn. (Sapotaceae) (34%), Lacunaria jenmanii (Oliv.) Ducke (Quiinaceae) (32%), Brosimum parinarioides Ducke (Moraceae) (32%) and Xylopia benthamii R.E. Fr. (Annonaceae) (30%). These results indicate an additive effect of human disturbances such that artificial flooding, when combined with deforestation, has an overall effect by orders of magnitude. SDMs can be effectively used as a predictive tool in the assessment of human impacts on rare tree species in tropical forests. The results also showed different vulnerability among the rare species, and these results may indicate that some species are more seriously threatened by the extreme loss of potential distribution areas.'

Abstract: 'Valuing global public goods like the Amazon rainforest by stated preference surveys of a representative sample of the global population would be very costly and time consuming. We explore the use of the Delphi Method in contingent valuation (CV) by asking a panel of 49 European environmental valuation experts in two rounds what they think would be the result if a European CV survey of Amazon Rainforest protection plans was conducted. The experts\xe2\x80\x99 best guess for the mean willingness-to-pay (WTP) by European households for preserving the current Amazon Rainforest, and thus avoiding a predicted loss in forest area by 2050 from currently 85% to 60% of the original forest in the 1970s, was 28 \xe2\x82\xac per household annually as an additional income tax. Aggregated over all European households this amounts to about 8.4 billion \xe2\x82\xac annually. This preliminary estimate indicate that WTP of distant beneficiaries is substantial, and could justify preservation of global ecosystem services where aggregated benefits of the local population often do not exceed the opportunity costs of preservation in terms of lost income from commercial activities. The income elasticity of WTP with respect to per-capita income in the European countries is 0.5\xe2\x80\x930.6. Recognizing the limitations and assumptions of the Delphi CV method, it could still be a time saving and cost-effective benefit transfer tool for providing international donors with much needed order-of-magnitude estimates of the non-use value of ecosystem services of global significance.'

Abstract: 'Standing stocks and fluxes of nitrogen, including nitrogen fixation and denitrification, were measured in a tropical rainforest on Oxisol in the Amazon Territory of Venezuela. The standing stock of nitrogen was comparable to that of temperate forests, but was higher than that in an adjacent forest on Spodosol. Fluxes were higher than in forests in the temperate zone, but lower than in another tropical forest on more fertile soil. Even though nitrogen was abundant, this does not mean that nitrogen could not be limiting to agriculture if the forest is cleared and the land cultivated. The nitrogen fixing and nitrogen conserving mechanisms are dependent upon the structure of the undisturbed forest, and destruction of the forest would eventually decrease the input of nitrogen to the soil.'

Abstract: 'As biodiversity loss rapidly increases through habitat degradation in the Amazon rainforest, the need to characterize and understand the species diversity becomes even more important. In this study we used empirical and published datasets to assess the diversity patterns and produce the first overview of the sphingid fauna in the Brazilian Amazon. We compared the diversity patterns in distinct areas in the biome by analyzing hawkmoth assemblages considering both species composition and abundance, and asked whether these communities are structured according to environmental factors. Additionally, we provide information of diel activity pattern of sphingids and evaluated the importance of time in sampling effort. We found that the Brazilian Amazon may harbor more than 80\xc2\xa0% of the hawkmoth species that occur in Brazil and more than half of the species recorded in South America. Species composition and assemblage structure is determined by the quality of the habitat (disturbed or undisturbed vegetation), temperature and relative humidity. Finally, we show that the temporal activity of sphingids presents distinct patterns at different taxonomic levels, highlighting the importance of full night collections to better characterize the fauna. Our results show that habitat alteration can be an important factor affecting sphingid assemblages, illustrating the importance of Protected Areas in species maintenance.'

Abstract: 'Atmospheric mercury sink in Amazonian rainforest was tested in this work. Forest soil was analyzed for 11 soil profiles at depths of 0\xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xa0cm in the northern portion of the Tapajos National Forest, Brazilian Amazon. Major oxides and Hg contents in soil and rock were determined by XRF and by Zeeman AAS, respectively. A mercury content of 146\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 was found in the bedrock, whereas the mercury content in soil averaged 240\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921. The soil pH varied from 4.4 to 5.2 and the organic matter contents varied from 1.4 to 7.5%. Enrichment factors of Hg for soil were calculated in relation to the parental bedrock assuming aluminum as immobile element. The lower soil layers presented mercury enrichment of 29\xe2\x80\x9398% in comparison to the bedrock. The upper soil layers showed mercury enrichment of 4\xe2\x80\x9324% in comparison to lower soil layers. Mercury in soil was highly correlated with Al, Fe, and Ti; however, no significant correlation was observed between Hg and organic matter contents. All results pointed to mercury retention in forest soils as a result of the combined action of rock weathering processes and continuous input of metal from the atmosphere, estimated to be between 31 and 46% of the total Hg in the upper soil layers. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Amazon rainforest is a sink for atmospheric Hg and they also highlight the role of rainforest as a barrier for a number of substances associated with suspended atmospheric particulate.'

There was a positive relationship between\xc2\xa0g s and both leaf temperature (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001) and VPDL (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001). If global temperature continues to increase as predicted by models, the direct increase in g s\xc2\xa0of saplings associated with an increase in temperature can be nullified if global warming negatively affects the water balance of plants (e.g. Guarea carinata) in this part of the Amazon.'

Abstract: 'Terrestrial oviposition with free-living aquatic larvae is a common reproductive mode used by amphibians within the central Amazonian rainforest. We investigated the factors presently associated with diversity of microhabitats (waterbodies) that may be maintaining the diversity of reproductive modes. In particular, desiccation, predation by fish, competition with other anurans and water quality were examined in 11 waterbodies as possible forces leading to the evolution of terrestrial oviposition. Predation experiments demonstrated that fish generally do not eat anuran eggs, and that predacious tadpoles and dytiscid beetle larvae are voracious predators of anuran eggs. The percentage of species with terrestrial oviposition was only weakly correlated with the occurrence of pond drying, pH and oxygen concentration, suggesting that anurans in this tropical community are able to use the range of water quality available for egg development. There was a tendency for terrestrial oviposition to be associated with the number of species of tadpoles using the waterbody, but we consider this to be spurious as there was no obvious competitive mechanism that could result in this relationship. The percentage of species with terrestrial oviposition was significantly positively related to our index of egg predation pressure, and negatively related to our index of fish biomass. Egg predation pressure was also negatively related to the index of fish biomass. These results allow us to discount as improbable the hypothesis that predation by fish on anuran eggs was an important selective pressure leading to terrestrial oviposition in this community. The strong positive relationship between terrestrial oviposition and our index of egg predation pressure indicates that these predators have exerted, and are exerting, a significant selective pressure for terrestrial oviposition. The strong negative relationship between the occurrence of fish and the egg predators suggests the surprising conclusion that the presence of fish actually protects aquatic anuran eggs from predation in this tropical system, and allows aquatic oviposition to dominate only in those waterbodies with moderate to high densities of fish. Our results suggest that terrestrial oviposition is a \xe2\x80\x9cfixed predator avoidance\xe2\x80\x9d trait.'

Abstract: 'This study examined how root growth and morphology were affected by variation in soil moisture at four Amazon rainforest sites with contrasting vegetation and soil types. Mean annual site root mass, length and surface area growth ranged between 3\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xa0t ha\xe2\x88\x921, 2\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0km m\xe2\x88\x922 and 8\xe2\x80\x9312\xc2\xa0m2 m\xe2\x88\x922 respectively. Mean site specific root length and surface area varied between 8\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0km kg\xe2\x88\x921 and 24\xe2\x80\x9334\xc2\xa0m2 kg\xe2\x88\x921. Growth of root mass, length and surface area was lower when soil water was depleted (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) while specific root length and surface area showed the opposite pattern (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). These results indicate that changes in root length and surface area per unit mass, and pulses in root growth to exploit transient periods of high soil water availability may be important means for trees in this ecosystem to increase nutrient and water uptake under seasonal and longer-term drought conditions.'

Abstract: 'Biophysical and biochemical plant foliage parameters play a key role in assessing vegetation health. Those plant parameters determine the spectral reflectance and transmittance properties of vegetation; therefore, hyperspectral remote sensing, particularly imaging spectroscopy, can provide estimates of leaf and canopy chemical properties. Based on the relationship between spectral response and biochemical/biophysical properties of the leaves and canopies, the PROSPECT radiative transfer model simulates the interaction of light with leaves. In this study, more than 1100 leaf samples from the Amazon forest of Ecuador were collected at several study sites, some of which are affected by petroleum pollution, and across the vertical profile of the forest. For every sample, field spectroscopy at leaf level was conducted with a spectroradiometer. The goal of this study was to assess leaf optical properties of polluted and unpolluted rainforest canopies across the vertical profile and identify vegetation stress expressed in changes of biophysical and biochemical properties of vegetation. An ANOVA followed by Holme\xe2\x80\x99s multiple comparisons of means and a principal component analysis showed that photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll and carotenoids have significantly lower levels across the vertical profile of the forest, particularly in sites affected by petroleum pollution. On the other hand, foliar water content showed significantly higher levels in the polluted site. Those findings are symptoms of vegetation stress caused by reduced photosynthetic activity and consequently decreased transpiration and water-use efficiency of the plants. Cross-comparison between SPAD-502 chlorophyll content meter index and chlorophyll content showed strong positive correlation coefficients (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.71 and r 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.51) which suggests that using the SPAD-502 chlorophyll index itself is sensitive enough to detect vegetation stress in a multispecies tropical forest. Therefore, the SPAD-502 can be used to assess chlorophyll content of vegetation across polluted and non-polluted sites at different canopy layers. The results presented in this paper contribute to the very limited literature on field spectroscopy and radiative transfer models applied to the vertical profile of the Amazon forest.'

Abstract: 'Man-made forest edges affect tree community composition and structure, but there is little information on the effects of natural edges. To detect tree community changes related to natural edges, we investigated a terrestrial forest island, bordered by grassland and mangrove landscapes, on the Brazilian Amazon coast. Forest structure and tree species composition were examined in 10-m-wide and 100-m-long plots from the forest edge to the interior in relation to both landscapes (8 grassland and 4 mangrove plots). Elevation and soil quality did not reveal strong spatial variability; tidal inundation established a boundary for forest expansion without influencing the forest interior. The tree community consisted of 82 species. No distinct changes in vegetation structure and composition with distance from the border were detected. Ordination procedures gave weak indications for shifts in community composition with distance from the edge and in respect to edge type. Single species occurred more frequently either close to or more distant from the grassland-forest interface. No such tendencies were detected at the mangrove-terrestrial forest interface, probably because the lack of structural differences between terrestrial forest and mangrove canopies did not permit the establishment of edge-related microclimatic gradients. Due to the isolation of the forest island and the harsh coastal environment, the tree community was dominated by generalist species which are well adapted to the conditions at the grassland\xe2\x80\x93forest edge. Furthermore, the patchy distribution of frequent species and the high number of rare species made it difficult to detect spatial patterns related to the forest edge.'

Abstract: 'The remote headwater areas of the Amazon rainforest are home to many Indigenous groups who prefer not to encounter and establish relationships with outsiders. These people have not been exposed to many everyday, infectious, Old World diseases and are therefore particularly susceptible to them, with extremely high morbidity and mortality rates. Recent Peruvian governments have encouraged the large-scale exploitation of timber, gas, and petrol in the Amazon. These economic interests have greatly increased pressure on previously remote areas, many of which are home to Indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. The Nahua and Nanti established direct relations with outsiders in the last 20 years and have experienced major changes in health status, social disruption, and bereavement as a consequence. The description of some of their epidemics highlights these populations\xe2\x80\x99 vulnerability to introduced diseases. Understood as the result of both \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexternal\xe2\x80\x9d factors, this vulnerability is a combination of their high susceptibility and of social changes resulting from increased resource pressure on their lands. The experiences of the peoples in the Kugapakori Nahua Reserve demonstrate the effects that resource extraction activities (both surface and subsoil) can have on local populations, not only when conducted in their lands (as in the case of the Nahua) but also when they take place downstream of their territories (as in the case of the Nanti). Because their susceptibility cannot be significantly altered immediately or without affecting their rights, the responsibility lies with local and national governments to limit exploitation on their lands. Not to do so constitutes a violation of isolated peoples\xe2\x80\x99 rights to life and health.'

Abstract: 'With the constant deforestation observed in the Amazon region in recent decades, changes in local climates are unavoidable. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand such climate changes by evaluating differences in precipitation (PRP), evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) between forested and deforested areas in the Brazilian Amazonia. Eight areas (four forested and four deforested) that maintained their land cover over a period of 15\xc2\xa0years (2000\xe2\x80\x932014) were selected using PRODES (Legal Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project) Digital\xe2\x80\x99s remote sensing database. The PRP data were retrieved from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM, resolution of 0.25\xc2\xb0), and the data of ET and PET were obtained from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor (MODIS, resolution of 0.05\xc2\xb0). The differences among PRP, ET and PET in each area were calculated using a regression model. The results show that ET was the only variable which presented a statistically significant difference between forested and deforested areas, mainly due to an intense decrease at the deforested sites during the dry season. Regarding PRP, a modest increase was observed on small areas, probably due to changes in local atmospheric dynamics, but on large areas decrease in PRP was noted. Nevertheless, in both cases there were no statistically significant differences between forested and deforested areas. PET presented a slightly increase value over deforested areas during the dry season, but not statistically significant as well.'

Abstract: ' Annona (Annonaceae) is an important source of fruits in the Brazilian Cerrado and the Amazon Rainforest. Some Annona species are widely commercialized as fresh fruit or as frozen pulp. Seeds are accustomedly discarded. Our main goal was to analyze fatty acids profile from seeds of A. crassiflora and A. coriacea from Cerrado, A. montana from Amazon Forest, and three cultivars (A. cherimola cv. Madeira, A. cherimola x A. squamosa cv. Pink\xe2\x80\x99s Mammonth and A. cherimola x A. squamosa cv. Gefner). The total oil yield ranged between 20 and 42% by weight of dry mass. The A cherimola x A. squamosa cv. Gefner has significantly higher total lipid yield than all other samples. 100\xc2\xa0g of fruit of this species present 6-8\xc2\xa0g of seeds. Considering the fruit production of Chile (over 221 ton of fruits/year), more than 1300 ton of seed/year could be obtained, which could provide at least 200 ton of seed oil. Oleic acid was predominant for most samples, but for A. montana linoleic acid was the most abundant FA. Phenotypic variation on FAME profile was observed. These new data are an urgent requirement for supporting conservation programs, mainly for Cerrado areas in Brazil.'

Abstract: 'The single-frequency Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (launched in April, 2012) is designed to provide a wide variety of imaging options compared to the prevailing SAR missions. The scale of the calibration task for the RISAT-1 mission is increased with the inclusion of multiple beams and polarizations (single, dual and quad) along with circular/hybrid polarization capabilities, for the first time from space. Significant efforts have been made in the evolution of SAR processor for the provision of radiometrically and geometrically calibrated products to the users. After the commissioning phase, RISAT-1 was put into routine operations in Oct. 2012. Since then extensive beam coverage of Amazon rainforest in various modes was carried out to evaluate the calibration parameters and SAR processor performance. Subsequently, the processor version 1.2.0 was improved to version 1.3.0 and with further modifications to version 1.4.0. This article details the analysis carried out at each processor version, by quality evaluation team, to quantify the parameter behaviour and to give feedback on the processor performance to the SAR processor team. The various radiometric quality parameters evaluated and monitored are shape of the antenna pattern, gamma-naught, backscattering coefficient (sigma-naught), speckle index, radiometric resolution and Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ). Data studied for the analysis is in Single Look Complex (SLC) for stripmap mode and multilook (Ground range) for ScanSAR and stripmap mode in dual and circular polarizations. The performance of version 1.4.0 for all the beams (near-to-far) is found to be consistent and meeting the mission specifications for the product.'

Abstract: '\nIn the present work, we have considered the vulnerability of some rare tree species to human disturbances in a high biodiversity tropical region. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the combined effect of deforestation and artificial flooding of the large Jirau hydroelectric reservoir on potential distribution areas of 13 locally rare tree species in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We performed species distribution modeling (SDM) by using the environmental distance algorithm. Based on these models, we found new sites and subsequently applied rapid ecological assessment to collect further species occurrence data. Additional SDMs were carried out using MaxEnt to determine the potential distribution areas of these rare species. We found that artificial flooding and deforestation caused combined losses of potential distribution areas of rare tree species between 8 and 39% of the total area. The most vulnerable species were Semaphyllanthe megistocaula (K. Krause) L. Andersson (Rubiaceae) (39%), Chrysophyllum colombianum (Aubr\xc3\xa9v.) T.D. Penn. (Sapotaceae) (34%), Lacunaria jenmanii (Oliv.) Ducke (Quiinaceae) (32%), Brosimum parinarioides Ducke (Moraceae) (32%) and Xylopia benthamii R.E. Fr. (Annonaceae) (30%). These results indicate an additive effect of human disturbances such that artificial flooding, when combined with deforestation, has an overall effect by orders of magnitude. SDMs can be effectively used as a predictive tool in the assessment of human impacts on rare tree species in tropical forests. The results also showed different vulnerability among the rare species, and these results may indicate that some species are more seriously threatened by the extreme loss of potential distribution areas.'

Abstract: 'Valuing global public goods like the Amazon rainforest by stated preference surveys of a representative sample of the global population would be very costly and time consuming. We explore the use of the Delphi Method in contingent valuation (CV) by asking a panel of 49 European environmental valuation experts in two rounds what they think would be the result if a European CV survey of Amazon Rainforest protection plans was conducted. The experts\xe2\x80\x99 best guess for the mean willingness-to-pay (WTP) by European households for preserving the current Amazon Rainforest, and thus avoiding a predicted loss in forest area by 2050 from currently 85% to 60% of the original forest in the 1970s, was 28 \xe2\x82\xac per household annually as an additional income tax. Aggregated over all European households this amounts to about 8.4 billion \xe2\x82\xac annually. This preliminary estimate indicate that WTP of distant beneficiaries is substantial, and could justify preservation of global ecosystem services where aggregated benefits of the local population often do not exceed the opportunity costs of preservation in terms of lost income from commercial activities. The income elasticity of WTP with respect to per-capita income in the European countries is 0.5\xe2\x80\x930.6. Recognizing the limitations and assumptions of the Delphi CV method, it could still be a time saving and cost-effective benefit transfer tool for providing international donors with much needed order-of-magnitude estimates of the non-use value of ecosystem services of global significance.'

Abstract: 'Standing stocks and fluxes of nitrogen, including nitrogen fixation and denitrification, were measured in a tropical rainforest on Oxisol in the Amazon Territory of Venezuela. The standing stock of nitrogen was comparable to that of temperate forests, but was higher than that in an adjacent forest on Spodosol. Fluxes were higher than in forests in the temperate zone, but lower than in another tropical forest on more fertile soil. Even though nitrogen was abundant, this does not mean that nitrogen could not be limiting to agriculture if the forest is cleared and the land cultivated. The nitrogen fixing and nitrogen conserving mechanisms are dependent upon the structure of the undisturbed forest, and destruction of the forest would eventually decrease the input of nitrogen to the soil.'

Abstract: 'As biodiversity loss rapidly increases through habitat degradation in the Amazon rainforest, the need to characterize and understand the species diversity becomes even more important. In this study we used empirical and published datasets to assess the diversity patterns and produce the first overview of the sphingid fauna in the Brazilian Amazon. We compared the diversity patterns in distinct areas in the biome by analyzing hawkmoth assemblages considering both species composition and abundance, and asked whether these communities are structured according to environmental factors. Additionally, we provide information of diel activity pattern of sphingids and evaluated the importance of time in sampling effort. We found that the Brazilian Amazon may harbor more than 80\xc2\xa0% of the hawkmoth species that occur in Brazil and more than half of the species recorded in South America. Species composition and assemblage structure is determined by the quality of the habitat (disturbed or undisturbed vegetation), temperature and relative humidity. Finally, we show that the temporal activity of sphingids presents distinct patterns at different taxonomic levels, highlighting the importance of full night collections to better characterize the fauna. Our results show that habitat alteration can be an important factor affecting sphingid assemblages, illustrating the importance of Protected Areas in species maintenance.'

Abstract: 'Atmospheric mercury sink in Amazonian rainforest was tested in this work. Forest soil was analyzed for 11 soil profiles at depths of 0\xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xa0cm in the northern portion of the Tapajos National Forest, Brazilian Amazon. Major oxides and Hg contents in soil and rock were determined by XRF and by Zeeman AAS, respectively. A mercury content of 146\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 was found in the bedrock, whereas the mercury content in soil averaged 240\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921. The soil pH varied from 4.4 to 5.2 and the organic matter contents varied from 1.4 to 7.5%. Enrichment factors of Hg for soil were calculated in relation to the parental bedrock assuming aluminum as immobile element. The lower soil layers presented mercury enrichment of 29\xe2\x80\x9398% in comparison to the bedrock. The upper soil layers showed mercury enrichment of 4\xe2\x80\x9324% in comparison to lower soil layers. Mercury in soil was highly correlated with Al, Fe, and Ti; however, no significant correlation was observed between Hg and organic matter contents. All results pointed to mercury retention in forest soils as a result of the combined action of rock weathering processes and continuous input of metal from the atmosphere, estimated to be between 31 and 46% of the total Hg in the upper soil layers. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Amazon rainforest is a sink for atmospheric Hg and they also highlight the role of rainforest as a barrier for a number of substances associated with suspended atmospheric particulate.'

Abstract: 'Nelson et al. (1994) report a non-uniform distribution of large (0.33 to 33 km2) blowdowns in the rainforests of Amazonia. Occurrence of such large disturbances in the wet, low wind speed regime of the Amazon Basin cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms such as fire or hurricanes. While downdrafts from deep convective clouds are likely candidates, this paper draws upon meteorological observations from the central Amazon Basin to show that the requisite magnitudes of wind speed can be reached but only under conditions which would explain the observed horizontal distributions of the large blowdowns. Outflow velocities due to density driven downdrafts in the convective clouds are shown from observations to reach 15 m/s and correspond to the propagation velocities of longlived Amazon squall lines. Maintenance over 48 h of these squall lines depends upon the correspondence between the outflow velocity and the propagation velocity. The storms propagate within a basic current moving at 5 m/s, increasing the outflow velocities to 21 m/s. The development of a storm-generated pressure field must be called upon to increase the magnitude of the density and basic currents to more than 30 m/s. Such conditions occur only when the convection is embedded in squall lines which reach their diurnal maximum at locations nearly coincident with the observed locations of the maxima in large blowdowns. The characteristics of the observed blowdowns in terms of orientation, size and shape are consistent with winds derived from the postulated downward moving density currents being deflected and accelerated orthogonally at canopy top and forest floor.'

Abstract: 'Many literature papers evaluate solutions in wireless sensor networks by simulation experiments. However, little attention is given to the adequacy of the simulator propagation models to the environment in which such solutions are employed. This can lead to imprecise or inconsistent results in relation to the real world. This paper presents a methodology for adjusting the parameters of these models. In particular, we present experimental results for rainforest environments, which can be the goal of many sensor networks monitoring applications. The impact of the proposed approach is shown by evaluating a localization solution. The results show that this procedure is necessary for a higher fidelity of simulation experiments.'

Abstract: 'Anopheles darlingi is the major vector of malaria in South America, and its behavior and distribution has epidemiological importance to biomedical research. In Brazil, An. darlingi is found in the northern area of the Amazon basin, where 99.5% of the disease is reported.'

Abstract: 'We test proposed generic tipping point early warning signals in a complex climate model (HadCM3) which simulates future dieback of the Amazon rainforest. The equation governing tree cover in the model suggests that zero and non-zero stable states of tree cover co-exist, and a transcritical bifurcation is approached as productivity declines. Forest dieback is a non-linear change in the non-zero tree cover state, as productivity declines, which should exhibit critical slowing down. We use an ensemble of versions of HadCM3 to test for the corresponding early warning signals. However, on approaching simulated Amazon dieback, expected early warning signals of critical slowing down are not seen in tree cover, vegetation carbon or net primary productivity. The lack of a convincing trend in autocorrelation appears to be a result of the system being forced rapidly and non-linearly. There is a robust rise in variance with time, but this can be explained by increases in inter-annual temperature and precipitation variability that force the forest. This failure of generic early warning indicators led us to seek more system-specific, observable indicators of changing forest stability in the model. The sensitivity of net ecosystem productivity to temperature anomalies (a negative correlation) generally increases as dieback approaches, which is attributable to a non-linear sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to temperature. As a result, the sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 anomalies to temperature anomalies (a positive correlation) increases as dieback approaches. This stability indicator has the benefit of being readily observable in the real world.'

Abstract: "Based on Fligstein's (1990) work on \xe2\x80\x98conceptions of control\xe2\x80\x99 (broad managerial paradigms), this paper provides an analysis of the ways in which information technology (IT) artefacts shape and are shaped by institutional contexts. Specifically, we report on primary and secondary empirical data that spans a 44-year period pertaining to the uses made of the Amazon rainforest monitoring system (a set of satellite-based geographic information systems). This paper argues that: (1) the process of institutional change is conflictual, emergent and contested; (2) the design and use of IT artefacts tend to reflect the currently dominant conceptions of control; (3) that IT artefacts that emerge within a specific conception of control can be later reconfigured to serve the interests of other conceptions of control; (4) and finally, IT artefacts might unintentionally reinforce alternate conceptions of control and lead to institutional change."

Abstract: 'In this study, we evaluated the damage caused in the field by Tibraca limbativentris St\xc3\xa5l adults at different levels of infestation (0, 1, 2, and 4 stink bugs) per three rice plants during three growth stages (V8, V13, and R4 stages) of upland rice cultivated in southwestern of Par\xc3\xa1 State, Amazon Rainforest region, Brazil. Heading time (panicle exertion) was affected by T. limbativentris infestations mainly in the vegetative stage and the whiteheads percentage in treatments ranged from 18.2 to 38%. The dead hearts percentages varied between 0 and 21.5%, and the mean number of primary branches (ramifications) ranged from 5.9\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.4 to 12.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.2. The number of empty spikelets was only affected in infestations with four insects/three plants, while the quantity of filled grains per panicle was affected only when infestations occurred during the vegetative stage. The total number of spikelets (filled\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89empty) per panicle decreased significantly in all phenological stages, and the percentage of damage ranged from 17 to 44% among treatments. Based on the proportion of damage observed, we suggest doubling the number of insects presently used as action threshold to 2 and 4 stink bugs per 15 stalks sampled for the vegetative stage, and of 1 or 2 stink bugs per 15 stalks sampled at the beginning of reproductive stage (R3/R4). Also, the field should be monitored during the entire vegetative stage, since most damage was observed in this phenological stage.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the relationship between North American beef consumption and deforestation in South and Central America. Some writers have argued that consumption of hamburgers in North America, particularly hamburgers consumed in fast food restaurants, contributes to the depletion of the rainforest in South and Central America. We survey the published policy literature on the causes of rainforest depletion in the region. We also review the published estimates of the rate and extent of clearing of rainforest that has occurred in South and Central America since 1970. Finally, we review the data on beef imports and consumption in Canada and the United States in a effort to assess the importance of South and Central America as suppliers of beef to the North American market. We conclude that the relationship between beef consumption in North America should not be considered an important cause of forest depletion in South and Central America. Domestic policies and market forces in the countries where rainforests are located are the leading causes of rainforest depletion in this region. This lesson seems to have been lost on some popular and even some textbook writers on this subject.'

Abstract: 'This article explores and explains deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. It primarily takes a green criminological perspective and looks at the harm that is inflicted on many of the Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants, including indigenous populations such as \xe2\x80\x98uncontacted\xe2\x80\x99 tribes of hunters-gatherers, the oldest human societies. The green criminological perspective also implies that the definition of victimisation is being enlarged: not only (future) humans, but also non-humans can be considered victims. Being the most biodiverse place on the planet, deforestation of the Amazon leads to threats and extinctions of animal and plant species. The main causes of deforestation in the Amazon are land conversion for agriculture (mainly cattle, also soy), practices that are mostly illegal. As the products of the (illegally) deforested rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon are mainly for export markets, western societies with large ecological footprints could be held responsible for deforestation of the Amazon.'

Abstract: 'This study shows a decrease of seasonal mean convection, cloudiness and an increase of surface shortwave down-welling radiation during 1984\xe2\x80\x932007 over the Amazon rainforests based on the analysis of satellite-retrieved clouds and surface radiative flux data. These changes are consistent with an increase in surface temperature, increased atmospheric stability, and reduction of moisture transport to the Amazon based on in situ surface and upper air meteorological data and reanalysis data. These changes appear to link to the expansion of the western Pacific warm pool during the December\xe2\x80\x93February season, to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and increase of SST over the eastern Pacific SST during the March\xe2\x80\x93May season, and to an increase of the tropical Atlantic meridional SST gradient and an expansion of the western Pacific warm pool during September\xe2\x80\x93November season. The resultant increase of surface solar radiation during all but the dry season in the Amazon could contribute to the observed increases in rainforest growth during recent decades.'

Abstract: 'During the summer of 1989 this author was afforded the opportunity to live and study in Brazil under the auspices of the Fulbright-Hays Commission.

Abstract: 'The Amazon environment has been exposed in the last decades to radical changes that have been accompanied by a remarkable rise of both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria. The malaria transmission process is highly influenced by factors such as spatial and temporal heterogeneities of the environment and individual-based characteristics of mosquitoes and humans populations. All these determinant factors can be simulated effectively trough agent-based models.'

Abstract: 'The phytomass structure of the evergreen lowland forest vegetation (Tall Amazon Caatinga) supported by tropaquods near San Carlos de Rio Negro, Federal Amazon Territory of Venezuela was studied in 13 10 m\xc3\x97 10 m plots. The plots were laid out subjectively to cover a low topographical gradient along which the forest on tropaquod is grading into a low woodland (Bana, or Low Amazon Caatinga). The phytomass was estimated by destructive sampling.'

Abstract: 'The presence of acid rain in the remote Amazon rainforest of southwestern Venezuela suggests the possibility of long-range transport of industrial pollutants to that region. Heavy metal concentrations were analyzed in samples of bryophytes and epiphyllous organisms growing on leaves and on bark in this forest. Concentrations of Cd, Pb, Ni, and Cr were higher in leaves with epiphylls than in leaves without epiphylls. All heavy metal concentrations in bryophytes from the Amazon basin site were lower than in bryophytes from temperature zones. The results indicate that long-range transport of air pollutants from industrial centers to the remote Amazon basin is occurring at only extremely low rates. Heavy metal concentrations in bryophytes and epiphylls at this site may still be considered close to present day background levels.'

Abstract: 'The Global Rainforest Mapping (GRFM) project was initiated in 1995 and, through a dedicated data acquisition policy by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), data acquisitions could be completed within a 1.5-year period, resulting in a spatially and temporally homogeneous coverage to contain the entire Amazon Basin from the Atlantic to the Pacific; Central America up to the Yucatan Peninsular in Mexico; equatorial Africa from Madagascar and Kenya in the east to Sierra Leone in the west; and Southeast Asia, including Papua New Guinea. To some extent, GRFM project is an international endeavor led by NASDA, with the goal of producing spatially and temporally contiguous Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data sets over the tropical belt on the Earth by use of the JERS-1 L-band SAR, through the generation of semi-continental, 100m resolution, image mosaics. The GRFM project relies on extensive collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Joint Research Center of the European Commission (JRC) and the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) for data acquisition, processing, validation and product generation. A science program is underway in parallel with product generation. This involves the agencies mentioned above, as well as a large number of international organizations, universities and individuals to perform field activities and data analysis at different levels.'

Abstract: 'Prolonged dry periods, and increasingly the generation of smoke and dust in partially-deforested regions, can influence the chemistry of rainfall and throughfall in moist tropical forests. We investigated rainfall and throughfall chemistry in a palm-rich open tropical rainforest in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia, where precipitation averages 2300\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 with a marked seasonal pattern, and where the fragmentation of remaining forest is severe. Covering the transition from dry to wet season (TDWS) and the wet season (WS) of 2004\xe2\x80\x932005, we sampled 42 rainfall events on event basis as well as 35 events on a within-event basis, and measured concentrations of DOC, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH 4 + , Cl\xe2\x88\x92, SO 4 2\xe2\x88\x92 , NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  and pH in rainfall and throughfall. We found strong evidence of both seasonal and within-event solute rainfall concentration dynamics. Seasonal volume-weighted mean (VWMS) concentrations in rainfall of DOC, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH 4 + , SO 4 2\xe2\x88\x92  and NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  were significantly higher in the TDWS than the WS, while VWMS concentrations in throughfall were significantly higher for all solutes except DOC. Patterns were generally similar within rain events, with solute concentrations declining sharply during the first few millimeters of rainfall. Rainfall and throughfall chemistry dynamics appeared to be strongly influenced by forest and pasture burning and a regional atmosphere rich in aerosols at the end of the dry season. These seasonal and within-event patterns of rainfall and throughfall chemistry were stronger than those recorded in central Amaz\xc3\xb4nia, where the dry season is less pronounced and where regional deforestation is less severe. Fragmentation and fire in Rond\xc3\xb4nia now appear to be altering the patterns in which solutes are delivered to remaining moist tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'During the Summer of 1992, the author traveled to three distinctive rainforest regions. Two were located in Ecuador: the west coastal rainforest and the northern \xe2\x80\x9cOriente\xe2\x80\x9d, a headwater region of the Amazon Basin. The third rainforest was located in the northwestern region of Belize. As a member of a study group sponsored by Save the Rainforest, Incorporated, the author was involved with the Programme for Belize Research station at Rio Bravo. Having witnessed a variety of types of rainforest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon during the summer of 1989 and the accompaying multitude of indigenous attitudes concerning the same, the author was keenly aware of destruction/preservation activities in these other regions.'

Abstract: '\nDuring Paleogene the Neotropical region was mainly covered by rainforests and ancient Amazon (AM) and Atlantic Forest (AF) were continuous and interconnected. The Andean uplift and drastic climate changes along the Eocene/Miocene resulted in the formation of a drier area separating AM from AF. However, multiple evidences have indicated recurrent connections between Neotropical rainforests during Quaternary. In this study we predict biogeographical connections between Neotropical Forests during the last glacial maximum (LGM\xe2\x80\x9421\xc2\xa0ka) and establish the climatic conditions that favored such connections. We tested if the general climatic conditions suitable to both Amazon (AM) and AF were uniform across current Cerrado and Caatinga areas or did subsets of these climatic spaces have independent spatial displacements connecting specific regions of AM and AF. For these, 50 occurrence points equidistant in the climatic space were sampled along the western and eastern AM and northern and southern AF and used to built ecological niche models (ENM) for each region. Potential distributions were predicted for the current and the LGM climatic scenarios using an ensemble approach. The ENMs detected the disjunct distribution of the two Neotropical rainforests in the present and showed three main connections during LGM: (1) climate suitable to western AM were detected along the northern coast of Brazil, overlapping the putative distribution of northern AF; (2) climates suitable to southern AF, northern AF and western AM were detected along the area now occupied by southern limits of the Caatinga and (3) the climate suitable to southern AF was found at the south limits of the eastern AM. Our findings suggest that subsets of both AM and AF may be considered distinct biogeographical units as implied by different responses to climate changes.'

Abstract: 'Ecological studies on rainforest in the central Amazon combine the analysis of environmental factors, which affect and are affected by the natural rainforest, and the nutrient balance of the forest biome. The natural rainforest is a highly sensitive climax system, whose quasi-steady state conditions are determined by the abundance and availability of micro- and macro-nutrients, the continuous but low flux of energy and bioelements through the various compartments, the pool of energy and nutrients in the standing crop of the rainforest and the multiple interactions and loops among species, matrices and environment.'

Abstract: 'To clarify characteristics of carbon (C) allocation in a Bornean tropical rainforest without dry seasons, gross primary production (GPP) and C allocation, i.e., above-ground net primary production (ANPP), aboveground plant respiration (APR), and total below-ground carbon flux (TBCF) for the forest were examined and compared with those from Amazonian tropical rainforests with dry seasons. GPP (30.61\xc2\xa0MgC\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, eddy covariance measurements; 34.40\xc2\xa0MgC\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, biometric measurements) was comparable to those for Amazonian rainforests. ANPP (6.76 MgC ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) was comparable to, and APR (8.01 MgC ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921) was slightly lower than, their respective values for Amazonian rainforests, even though aboveground biomass was greater at our site. TBCF (19.63 MgC ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921) was higher than those for Amazonian forests. The comparable ANPP and higher TBCF were unexpected, since higher water availability would suggest less fine root competition for water, giving higher ANPP and lower TBCF to GPP. Low nutrient availability may explain the comparable ANPP and higher TBCF. These data show that there are variations in C allocation patterns among mature tropical rainforests, and the variations cannot be explained solely by differences in soil water availability.'

Abstract: 'Data on a variety of organic gases are presented, obtained with a protontransfer mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) operated during the March 1998 LBA/CLAIREairborne measurement campaign, between 60 and 12500 m over the rainforest inSurinam (2\xc2\xb0 N\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xb0 N, 54\xc2\xb0 W\xe2\x80\x9357\xc2\xb0 W). The instrumentcan detect molecules with a proton affinity greater than water, includingalkenes, dialkenes, carbonyls, alcohols, and nitriles. Many such molecules areemitted from the rainforest (e.g., isoprene) or formed from the oxidation ofprimary emissions (e.g., methylvinylketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR)).From a comparison with modelled data; the variation with altitude; previouslyreported biogenic emissions and the time and location of the measurement,possible and probable identities for the significant masses encountered in therange 33\xe2\x80\x93140 amu have been deduced.The main observed protonated masses, postulated identities and observedaverage boundary layer mixing ratios over the rainforest were: 33 methanol(1.1 nmol/mol); 42 acetonitrile (190 pmol/mol); 43 multiple possibilities (5.9nmol/mol), 45 acetaldehyde (1.7 nmol/mol), 47 formic acid (not quantified);59 acetone (2.9 nmol/mol), 61 acetic acid (not quantified), 63 dimethylsulphide (DMS) (289 pmol/mol), 69 isoprene (1.7 nmol/mol), 71 MVK + MACR (1.3nmol/mol), 73 methyl ethyl ketone (1.8 nmol/mol), 75 hydroxyacetone (606pmol/mol), 83 C5 isoprene hydroxy carbonylsC5H8O2, methyl furan, and cis 3-hexen-1-ol(732 pmol/mol), 87 C5 carbonyls and methacrylic acid, 95 possibly2-vinyl furan (656 pmol/mol), 97 unknown (305 pmol/mol), 99 cis hexenal (512pmol/mol) and 101 isoprene C5 hydroperoxides (575 pmol/mol). Somespecies agreed well with those derived from an isoprene only photochemicalmodel (e.g., mass 71 MVK + MACR) while others did not and were observed athigher than previously reported mixing ratios (e.g., mass 59 acetone, mass 63DMS). Monoterpenes were not detected above the detection limit of 300pmol/mol. Several species postulated are potentially important sources ofHOx in the free troposphere, e.g., methanol, acetone, methyl ethylketone, methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein.'

Abstract: 'Climate change is strong in the Amazon basin. Climate models consistently predict widespread warmer and drier conditions by the end of the 21st century. As a consequence, water stress will increase throughout the region. We here review current understanding of the impact of climate change on forests\xe2\x80\x99 distribution patterns, species diversity and ecosystem functioning of lowland rainforests in the Amazon basin. We reviewed 192 studies that provide empirical evidence, historical information and theoretical models. Over millions of years rainforests expansions and contractions have been accompanied by changes in the diversity and productivity of forests. In the future, drought will produce forest contractions along the forest edges and the savanna ecotone, causing an extensive savannization, particularly in the east. In terms of diversity, warming will reduce plant species survival by decreasing their productivity, but extinctions may also occur as a result of vegetation disequilibrium, as many plants, dispersal and pollinator species will fail to track changing climate; mild drought kills understory trees and severe drought may eliminate canopy trees as well. Severe droughts will thus produce directional changes in species composition, although these shifts may vary among forests on different soil types. In terms of ecosystem functioning, droughts will reduce root growth and standing biomass and may shift the Amazonian forest from being CO2 sinks to become CO2 sources. Physiological and ecological responses to warming and the feedback between vegetation and climate are still not completely understood. In particular, experimental assays that allow direct conclusions on the response of Amazonian plants to the predicted climatic conditions are needed. Such studies could make possible more reliable estimates of future climatic and vegetation responses.'

Abstract: 'Understanding climatic controls on tropical forest productivity is key to developing more reliable models for predicting how tropical biomes may respond to climate change. Currently there is no consensus on which factors control seasonal changes in tropical forest tree growth. This study reports the first comprehensive plot-level description of the seasonality of growth in a Peruvian tropical forest. We test whether seasonal and interannual variations in climate are correlated with changes in biomass increment, and whether such relationships differ among trees with different functional traits. We found that biomass increments, measured every 3\xc2\xa0months on the two plots, were reduced by between 40 and 55\xc2\xa0% in the peak dry season (July\xe2\x80\x93September) relative to peak wet season (January\xe2\x80\x93March). The seasonal patterns of biomass accumulation are significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) associated with seasonal patterns of rainfall and soil water content; however, this may reflect a synchrony of seasonal cycles rather than direct physiological controls on tree growth rates. The strength of the growth seasonality response among trees is significantly correlated to functional traits: consistent with a hypothesised trade-off between maximum potential growth rate and hydraulic safety, tall and fast-growing trees with broad stems had the most strongly seasonal biomass accumulation, suggesting that they are more productive in the wet season, but more vulnerable to water limitation in the dry season.'

Abstract: 'Large-scale economically-driven encroachments into tropical rainforest environments are major factors for disease emergence. A better understanding of the process of disease emergence can be best derived from a multilevel, transdisciplinary ecosystem approach that analyzes health data in its biological, ecological, social, and cultural context. Multiple methods, including ethnographic techniques, are recommended for such an approach. The value of this approach and methodology is presented in this article through a rapid health assessment case study of an unexplained fatal syndrome that occurred among the Secoya peoples of the Ecuadorian Amazon in 1999. This type of study is significant given the lack of health data for indigenous populations at risk of disease emergence. Moreover, indigenous cultures share a long-term, close relationship to the land and each other, which makes information about changes in their environment and health patterns highly salient to them. This local knowledge is of strategic value to researchers working on issues of environmental change and disease emergence.'

Abstract: 'Many numerical studies, among them, global and regional models, have been used to simulate climatic impact due to Amazon deforestation. Most of them did not consider deforestation as usually observed and the induced dynamic changes. The present study explores the physical impacts due to Amazon deforestation by considering local and remote changes in the circulation and thermodynamics. For this, numerical experiments were conducted with RegCM3 using a relatively fine horizontal grid spacing (50\xc2\xa0km), more realistic deforested areas (similar to the highway-network-shaped), and an updated land use map. The studied period was 2001\xe2\x80\x932006 October\xe2\x80\x93March. As in most previous studies focusing on Amazon deforestation, the RegCM3-simulated air temperature increases over degraded areas, ranging from 1.0 to 2.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, and precipitation decreases of around 10\xc2\xa0%. This result is mainly related to depletion in evapotranspiration rates provided by lesser soil water extraction by the degraded vegetation. The weakening of upward motion in the mid-upper troposphere is an associated mechanism that explains the precipitation decrease after Amazon deforestation. A new result is the simulated precipitation increase, about 10\xc2\xa0%, over the eastern South America and the adjacent South Atlantic Ocean. In these areas, the precipitation increase during October\xe2\x80\x93March is associated with intensification of upper-level high pressure (the Bolivian high) coupled with negative geopotential height anomalies southeastward of the center of the high.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the forces that shaped Neotropical diversity is central issue to explain tropical biodiversity and inform conservation action; yet few studies have examined large, widespread species. Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrrestris, Perissodactyla, Tapiridae) is the largest Neotropical herbivore whose ancestors arrived in South America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. A Pleistocene diversification is inferred for the genus Tapirus from the fossil record, but only two species survived the Pleistocene megafauna extinction. Here, we investigate the history of lowland tapir as revealed by variation at the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome b, compare it to the fossil data, and explore mechanisms that could have shaped the observed structure of current populations.'

Abstract: 'This paper describes the development of a logistic model to predict the probability of surface fire spread in Brazilian rainforest fuels from outdoor experimental measurements. Surface fires spread over litter composed mostly of dead leaves and twigs. There were 72 individual outdoor experiments in eighteen sites. The fire propagated in 49% of the experiments. In each experiment, the litter height, litter temperature, unburned litter mass, wet and dry litter mass, soil temperature, wet and dry soil mass, ambient wind velocity, ambient air temperature, ambient air relative humidity and duration of fire spread were measured. Using these data, the rate of fire spread, litter bulk density, litter and soil moisture content, litter load and litter residue fraction were determined. For the sake of analysis, experimental results were classified into two groups: one for which the fire propagated and the other one for which the fire self-extinguished. Analyses of a logistic regression model showed that the relevant parameters for fire propagation are litter height and litter moisture content. Concerning the probability of successful fire propagation, the model showed a true positive rate of 71% and a true negative rate of 84%. The outdoor experiments also served to gather data to improve the understanding of surface fires and to provide input data for future computer simulations.'

Abstract: 'The contribution of deep tree roots to the nutrition of a tropicalrainforest were studied along an edaphic transect in French Guyana. Soil typeswere mapped in relation to the texture of the upper horizons and the depth ofoccurrence of the loamy saprolite. The position of mature individuals of fourcommon species, differing by they rooting depth, was identified and tree leaveswere analysed for major nutrients and strontium (Sr) isotopic ratios.On average, the range of leaf isotopic ratio (87Sr/86Sr= 0.714\xe2\x80\x930.716) was narrow compared to that of bulk soils(87Sr/86Sr = 0.72\xe2\x80\x930.77). Steep gradients ofincreasing 87Sr/86Sr in roots with soil depth were foundin all investigated profiles, which indicated that the flux of Sr deposited inrain and leached from the litter layer was tightly retained in the upper soillayers. Over the whole of the site, as well as within each soil unit, tree87Sr/86Sr ratios were very similar whatever the species,and close to litter and near-surface roots 87Sr/86Srratios, suggesting no or very little Sr contribution from deep tree roots.Variations of Ca and Sr concentrations in leaves were strongly correlated butnot with leaf 87Sr/86Sr ratios. These results support thetheory that Sr and Ca uptake and cycling are mostly superficial in tropicalrainforests.'

Abstract: 'A long-term predictive model, MAGIC, was applied to a Central Amazonian catchment area to illustrate large scale deforestation effects on \xe2\x80\x98islands\xe2\x80\x99 of preserved areas, for the situations with and without climate changes. In addition, model sensitivity in response to different organic matter levels in the soil and stream waters as well as to different Al solubility constants was evaluated. The model output was strongly dependent on the chosen values of organic matter concentration and Al solubility constant. Application of the model to a 30 yr deforestation program revealed increases in streamwater ionic concentrations with or without climate change, although streamwater ionic concentrations were predicted to be higher as a consequence of climate change. On the centennial scale, streamwater ionic concentrations reach a new equilibrium, with concentrations higher than those prior to the surrounding deforestation. With the assumed increased cation deposition to the preserved forest areas, soil exchangeable cation concentrations increase with time and aluminum is released to solution. At the end of the simulated deforestation program, SO 4 2\xe2\x88\x92  in the preserved areas began to be released to streamwater, inducing acidification. Application of the MAGIC model makes possible to estimate, for the rainforest environment, water quality changes as a function of different climate and land use changes.'

Abstract: 'Humans have been changing the natural fire regimes in most Brazilian vegetation types for over 4000 years. Natural lightning fires can easily happen in savannas and grasslands, but they are rare in the moist rainforests. Today, anthropogenic fires are frequent in both the fire-adapted cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and the fire-sensitive rainforest. In this paper, I compare two very different biomes concerning their susceptibilities and responses to fire: the Amazon rainforest and the cerrado. I present an overview of their fire history, especially regarding human-made fires for land management, and pull together information about the use of fire by indigenous peoples in the cerrado and the Amazon, as this information is very fragmented. Accordingly, I describe how fire regimes have changed in these biomes over time due to agricultural practices and the consequences of the current altered fire regimes. After European settlement, fire frequency greatly increased in the cerrado, especially related to cattle ranching, and more recently in the more seasonal landscapes in the Amazon. In cerrado natural preserves, however, managers try to keep fire away, but wildfires eventually come and develop into destructive events. Actions to reduce biodiversity loss and environmental deterioration due to inappropriate fire management are necessary and should be very distinct in both areas: in the Amazon they would include the development of policies to stimulate fire-free, small-scale agricultural projects, and in the cerrado, sustainable use of fire for cattle ranching is possible but the regimes must be fitted to local specific features in order to avoid land degradation. In cerrado conservation areas, proper fire management programs based on scientific knowledge and the incorporation of the traditional expertise of indigenous peoples are needed to maintain the biological diversity, to maintain the ecological processes, and to reduce wildfires.'

Abstract: 'The diversity of Trichoderma (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) colonizing leaf litter as well as the rhizosphere of Garcinia macrophylla (Clusiaceae) was investigated in primary and secondary rain forests in Colombian Amazonia. DNA barcoding of 107 strains based on the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and 2) of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster and the partial sequence of the translation elongation factor 1 alpha (tef1) gene revealed that the diversity of Trichoderma was dominated (71\xc2\xa0%) by three common cosmopolitan species, namely Trichoderma harzianum sensu lato (41\xc2\xa0%), Trichoderma spirale (17\xc2\xa0%) and Trichoderma koningiopsis (13\xc2\xa0%). Four ITS 1 and 2 phylotypes (13 strains) could not be identified with certainty. Multigene phylogenetic analysis and phenotype profiling of four strains with an ITS1 and 2 phylotype similar to Trichoderma strigosum revealed a new sister species of the latter that is described here as Trichoderma strigosellum sp. nov. Sequence similarity searches revealed that this species also occurs in soils of Malaysia and Cameroon, suggesting a pantropical distribution.'

Abstract: 'Coarse woody debris (CWD, dead wood sections \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm diameter) represents a large store of carbon in tropical forests; however, estimates of the flux of carbon from CWD in these forests remain poorly constrained. The objective of this study was to resolve the dry/wet season response of respiration in CWD (R cwd), and investigate the importance of biotic and abiotic factors for predicting the seasonal change of R cwd at the ecosystem level. This study presents a 4-month time series of R cwd measurements conducted on 42 dead trees (26 species) at the Paracou Research Station in French Guiana. R cwd measurements were repeated 13 times on each CWD sample from July to November 2011, spanning the transition from wet to dry season, and then from dry season to the following wet season. Seasonal drought caused monthly R cwd to drop by 20.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05.1% over the wet\xe2\x80\x93dry transition. Changes in woody tissue moisture content explained 41.9% of the measured seasonal variability in R cwd, but 60% of the seasonal variability in mean forest R cwd rates could be modelled using surface soil water content. We estimate that R cwd is approximately 5% of annual ecosystem respiration (R eco) and that seasonal variations in R cwd contribute appreciably to seasonal variations of R eco, and should be included in functional models simulating the response of tropical rainforest ecosystems to current and future climate.'

Abstract: 'A low-level nocturnal wind maximum is shown to exist over extensive and nearly undisturbed rainforest near the central Amazon city of Manaus. Analysis of meteorological data collected during the 1985 and 1987 Amazon Boundary Layer Experiments (ABLE 2A and 2B) indicates the presence of this nocturnal wind maximum during both the wet and dry seasons of the Central Amazon Basin. Daytime wind speeds which are characteristically 3\xe2\x80\x937 m s-1 between 300 and 1000 m increase to 10\xe2\x80\x9315m s-1 shortly after sunset. The wind speed maximum is reached in the early evening, with wind speeds remaining high until several hours after sunrise. The nocturnal wind maximum is closely linked to a strong low-level inversion formed by radiational cooling of the rainforest canopy. The night-time inversion extends up to 300 m with strong vertical shear of the horizontal wind below the inversion top and uniformly strong horizontal winds above the inversion top. Frictional decoupling of the air above the inversion from the rough forest below, however, is responsible for only part of the observed increase. Surface and low-level pressure gradients between the undisturbed forest and the large Amazon river system and the city of Manaus are shown to be responsible for much of the nocturnal wind increase. The pressure gradients are interpreted as a function of the thermal differences between undisturbed forest and the river/city. The importance of both the frictional decoupling and the horizontal pressure gradient suggest that the nocturnal wind maximum does not occur uniformly over all Amazonia. We suspect that stronger low-level winds are pervasive under clear skies and strong surface cooling and that, in many places (i.e., near rivers), local pressure gradients enhance the low-level nocturnal winds.'

Abstract: 'The widespread clearing of tropical forests causes lower tree cover, drier microclimate, and higher and drier fuel loads of forest edges, increasing the risk of fire occurrence and its intensity. We used a manipulative field experiment to investigate the influence of fire and fuel loads on ant communities and their interactions with myrmecochorous seeds in the southern Amazon, a region currently undergoing extreme land-use\xc2\xa0intensification. Experimental fires and fuel addition were applied to 40\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa040-m plots in six replicated blocks, and ants were sampled between 15 and 30\xc2\xa0days after fires in four strata: subterranean, litter, epigaeic, and arboreal. Fire had extensive negative effects on ant communities. Highly specialized cryptobiotic and predator species of the litter layer and epigaeic specialist predators were among the most sensitive, but we did not find evidence of overall biotic homogenization following fire. Fire reduced rates of location and transport of myrmecochorous seeds, and therefore the effectiveness of a key ecosystem service provided by ants, which we attribute to lower ant abundance and increased thermal stress. Experimental fuel addition had only minor effects on attributes of fire severity, and limited effects on ant responses to fire. Our findings indicate that enhanced fuel loads will not decrease ant diversity and ecosystem services through increased fire severity, at least in wetter years. However, higher fuel loads can still have a significant effect on ants from Amazonian rainforests because they increase the risk of fire occurrence, which has a detrimental impact on ant communities and a key ecosystem service they provide.'

Abstract: 'Here I review what we know about the physical structure of forests in the Amazon Basin. Although the forests in the Amazon basin are among the most important ecosystems on Earth, they are little sampled, described or understood. This review is motivated by that lack of knowledge, and also attempts both to add a level of organization to what we do know and to suggest future avenues of research. I do this by first realizing that Amazon forests are fundamentally either unflooded or flooded. Within that context, (1) unflooded forests can be further defined by such characteristics as soil type, microtopological relief, and human-induced disturbance regime and (2) flooded forests can be further defined by water characteristics, degree of flooding and duration of flooding. After completing a review using these basic groupings, I suggest that our knowledge of the different kinds of forests in the Amazon basin is likely to grow substantially as we increase sampling in the future. I close with questions to help guide those future efforts, ideas on how forest communities could be defined quantitatively, and a call for more research funding of the Amazon.'

Abstract: 'Fallow utilization schemes are becoming increasingly popular in agroforestry designs. However little attention has been given to the fate of valuable fallow plants after the end of the initial fallow cycle, and over successive fallow cycles on a regional or inter-fallow level. Evidence is presented here for the spontaneous long-term community enrichment of an area with valuable plants in a cyclic or iterative fashion, in the context of an existing fallow utilization scheme in the Amazon. Review of the ecological processes which operate at microsite, field and community levels indicate that:'

Abstract: 'Stream discharge\xe2\x80\x93concentration relationships are indicators of terrestrial ecosystem function. Throughout the Amazon and Cerrado regions of Brazil rapid changes in land use and land cover may be altering these hydrochemical relationships. The current analysis focuses on factors controlling the discharge\xe2\x80\x93calcium (Ca) concentration relationship since previous research in these regions has demonstrated both positive and negative slopes in linear log10discharge\xe2\x80\x93log10Ca concentration regressions. The objective of the current study was to evaluate factors controlling stream discharge\xe2\x80\x93Ca concentration relationships including year, season, stream order, vegetation cover, land use, and soil classification. It was hypothesized that land use and soil class are the most critical attributes controlling discharge\xe2\x80\x93Ca concentration relationships. A multilevel, linear regression approach was utilized with data from 28 streams throughout Brazil. These streams come from three distinct regions and varied broadly in watershed size (<1 to >106\xc2\xa0ha) and discharge (10\xe2\x88\x925.7\xe2\x80\x93103.2\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921). Linear regressions of log10Ca versus log10discharge in 13 streams have a preponderance of negative slopes with only two streams having significant positive slopes. An ANOVA decomposition suggests the effect of discharge on Ca concentration is large but variable. Vegetation cover, which incorporates aspects of land use, explains the largest proportion of the variance in the effect of discharge on Ca followed by season and year. In contrast, stream order, land use, and soil class explain most of the variation in stream Ca concentration. In the current data set, soil class, which is related to lithology, has an important effect on Ca concentration but land use, likely through its effect on runoff concentration and hydrology, has a greater effect on discharge\xe2\x80\x93concentration relationships.'

Abstract: 'Six streams in the Los Tuxtlas region, a volcanic area in southeastern Mexico, were characterized chemically and biologically. Temperature, pH, conductivity, ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, CaCO\xe2\x88\x923 and SO2-4), nutrients (NO\xe2\x88\x923, NH+4, total P and PO\xe2\x88\x9234), and chlorophyll a from epilithon were measured every other month from September 1996 to July 1997. The streams studied had a consistent pattern of cation dominance (Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+>K+), and ionic concentrations varied little during the year of study; nutrients, however, showed strong temporal variability. The ion chemistry of the streams was influenced by bedrock weathering according to the Gibbs Model. The streams are chiefly mesotrophic, but their primary production may be limited by nitrogen based on the N:P ratio. Streams differed in chlorophyll a concentrations and their productivity changed temporally. They were among the most mineral-rich tropical streams, and both their ion concentration levels and cationic patterns coincided with other neotropical volcanic streams. Although there was a pattern in which ion concentrations of the streams were negatively related to the proportion of conserved vegetation and positively related to the proportion of pastures and croplands, the relationships were not statistically significant. We concluded that differences in the major ions of the streams studied were caused by the great heterogeneity in geology and soil types, as well as by geothermal activity in the area. Temporal changes in nutrients were related to biological processes in the streams that influenced primary productivity. Moreover, the influence of land use might be hidden by the strong effect of this heterogeneity on the streams studied.'

Abstract: 'A quantitative inventory of trees and lianas was conducted (1) to compare floristic composition, diversity and stem density variation between three different forest types (tierra firme, floodplain and swamp), and (2) to analyse the relationships between floristic similarity and forest structure in two regions ~60\xc2\xa0km apart in Yasun\xc3\xad National Park, Amazonian Ecuador. A total of 1,087 species with a diameter at breast height\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa02.5\xc2\xa0cm were recorded in 25 0.1-ha plots. Tierra firme was the habitat with the highest number of species and stem density for trees and lianas, followed by floodplain and swamp in both regions. Two hypotheses that have been independently proposed to describe plant distribution in tropical rain forests, together explain species spatial distribution in this study. The fact that the 30\xc2\xa0most important species per forest type (totalling 119 species) accounted for 48.2% of total individuals supports the oligarchy hypothesis. Likewise, 28 out of these 119 species are reported as restricted to a single forest type, which supports the environmental-determinism hypothesis. In general, both canopy and understorey trees and lianas showed rather similar floristic patterns across different forest types and regions.'

Abstract: 'Our current understanding of bird community responses to tropical forest fires is limited and strongly geographically biased towards South America. Here we used the circular plot method to carry out complete bird inventories in undisturbed, once burned (1998) and twice burned forests (1983 and 1998) in East Kalimantan (Indonesia). Additionally, environmental variables were measured within a 25\xc2\xa0m radius of each plot. Three years after fire the number of birds and bird species were similar for undisturbed and burned forests, but species diversity and turnover were significantly lower in the burned forests. The bird species composition also differed significantly between undisturbed and burned forests, with a strong decline of closed forest preferring bird species accompanied by a strong increase in degraded forest preferring species in burned forests. These differences were strongly related to differences in environmental conditions such as shifts in vegetation cover and layering and differences in ground and understorey vegetation structure. We also found significant shifts in body mass distribution, foraging height and feeding guilds between the bird communities in unburned and burned forests. Surprisingly, repeated burning did not lead to increasing impoverishment of the avifauna, and both once and twice burned forests still contained most of the bird species that were also present in undisturbed forest, even though their densities were considerably lowered.'

Abstract: 'It was in faraway places that Euro-Americans first encountered the wondrous inner worlds to which hallucinogenic drugs offer access. From these colonial settings where the substances were used for religious and shamanic purposes, they were brought into experimental psychology laboratories and psychiatric clinics. Their biomedical exploration contributed significantly to making the 1950s the golden age of psychopharmacology. However, this research came to a near-total standstill as psychedelics were prohibited in the wake of clashes between the counterculture and the so-called establishment in the late 1960s. Today, however, such drugs have begun to play new roles in our biosocieties. The publications reviewed in this Books Forum examine different aspects of this story.'

Abstract: 'Growth rings are investigated in trees harvested in the second cutting cycle in southern Amazonia and have important implications for dendrochronological studies and for forest management.'

Abstract: 'This article describes how the lithic industries of the Amazon have been studied in Brazilian archaeology, and presents a historical record of research in the region. The article then attempts to analyze the reasons for the relative paucity of work on this research theme. The record includes studies of lithic industries related to the presence of pottery-using (ceramist) groups as well as those related to occupation of areas by hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherers. It points to different factors that have contributed to the type and quantity of information currently available, notably the issues of changing environmental conditions relating to site preservation and visibility that necessarily interface with the disciplinary history of archaeology within the Amazon Basin region. The paper seeks to highlight the issues that have dominated the research field, contextualizing them and redefining them in order to indicate future prospects for work in relation to the lithic industries of the macro-region.'

Abstract: 'Although soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from tropical forests may play an important role in global carbon (C) balance, our knowledge of the fluctuations and factors controlling soil CO2 efflux in the Asian tropics is still poor. This study characterizes the temporal and spatial variability in soil CO2 efflux in relation to temperature/moisture content and estimates annual efflux from the forest floor in an aseasonal intact tropical rainforest in Sarawak, Malaysia. Soil CO2 efflux varied widely in space; the range of variation averaged 17.4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921 in total. While most CO2 flux rates were under 10\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921, exceptionally high fluxes were observed sporadically at several sampling points. Semivariogram analysis revealed little spatial dependence in soil CO2 efflux. Temperature explained nearly half of the spatial heterogeneity, but the effect varied with time. Seasonal variation in CO2 efflux had no fixed pattern, but was significantly correlated with soil moisture content. The correlation coefficient with soil moisture content (SMC) at 30 and 60\xc2\xa0cm depth was higher than at 10\xc2\xa0cm depths. The annual soil CO2 efflux, estimated from the relationship between CO2 efflux and SMC at 30\xc2\xa0cm depth, was 165\xc2\xa0mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 (1,986\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921). As this area is known to suffer severe drought every 4\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0years caused by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the results suggest that an unpredictable dry period might affect soil CO2 efflux, leading an annual variation in soil C balance.'

Abstract: 'The distribution and the abundance of a species define the limits of itspotential use. Despite this simple fact, there are only a few studies thathave quantified the actual abundance and the distribution of species/resourcesin Amazonian rainforests, especially within unflooded (tierra firme) forests.The present study focused on the distributions and the abundances of palms,since they are both structurally important and widely utilized in the forests ofAmazonia. The similarity of the palm communities at eight different sites intierra firme forests of Peruvian Amazonia were examined, and the eighteconomically most important palm species were selected for more detailed studieson abundance and population structure. The results showed that both the overallpalm community composition and the abundances of the eight focal palm speciesvaried among the sites, and that these differences in abundances were related tothe amount of exchangeable cations in the soils. Population structure differedbetween growth forms: large, solitary palm species were mainly represented byseedlings and juveniles, whereas small, clonal palm species had very fewseedlings. The great variability in abundance of palm species should be takeninto account when estimating the availability of palm resources, as well as inconservation planning of the palm species in an area of interest.'

Abstract: 'According\n to the forest statistic data, the forest degradation in West Kalimantan has been increasing since 2006. The satellite remote sensing data can provide information more effective and economical input rather than direct field observation that is difficult to access. In this research, we applied a spectral index derived from remote sensing satellite data, the Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI), then compared it with the widely used forest degradation index, the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to have an enhanced detection of forest canopy damage caused by selective logging activities and associated forest fires in West Kalimantan, especially in Kapuas Hulu and Sintang districts. The NDFI was derived from combination of green vegetation, shadow, soil, and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) fractions images from spectral mixture analysis model. The NBR and NDVI were generated from spectral reflectance values of near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and red spectrums. The satellite data used for monitoring forest degradation were Landsat-year 2006\xe2\x80\x932009 and then continued with 4-year SPOT 2009\xe2\x80\x932012. The result showed that the forest degradation was detected initially in 2008 up to 2012 in the research area. Spectral indices analysis (NDFI, NBR, NDVI) was tested and verified by ground survey data in 2012. We found that NDFI has higher accuracy (95\xc2\xa0%) to classify the degradation forest due to logging and burning activities rather than NBR or NDVI. The forest degradation mapping also conducted using mosaic of Landsat data year 2000\xe2\x80\x932009 for whole of West Kalimantan province. This method is suitable for a forest degradation monitoring tool in tropical rainforest.'

Abstract: 'Primary tropical lowland rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia, has been largely reduced to small to medium-sized, often isolated, forest islands surrounded by a highly altered agricultural landscape. The biodiversity patterns of leaf litter ant communities were monitored in two forest fragments of differing size as well as in a contiguous forest over the course of two years. Species number and diversity in the forest isolates was significantly lower, reaching only 47.5% of the species number collected in the contiguous forest. Species density was also lower, which had led to a thinning of the ant community in the fragments. Community composition was substantially altered in the forest remnants, and an increase of tramp species with smaller fragment size was detected. These results were unexpected and alarming, as the medium-sized forest is with its 42.9 km2 a comparatively large primary forest fragment for Sabah.'

Abstract: 'Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an endemic disease in Bolivia, particularly in the rainforest of Cochabamba, in the municipality of Villa Tunari. The precarious, dispersed, and poorly accessible settlements in these farming communities make it difficult to study them, and there are no epidemiological studies in the area. The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis.'

Abstract: 'The Atlantic rainforest ecosystem, where bromeliads are abundant, provides an excellent environment for Kerteszia species, because these anophelines use the axils of those plants as larval habitat. Anopheles (K.) cruzii and Anopheles (K.) bellator are considered the primary vectors of malaria in the Atlantic forest. Although the incidence of malaria has declined in some areas of the Atlantic forest, autochthonous cases are still registered every year, with Anopheles cruzii being considered to be a primary vector of both human and simian Plasmodium.'

Abstract: 'Based on species endemism, three biodiversity centers, called \xe2\x80\x9cEcological Corridors\xe2\x80\x9d have been proposed as one of the main conservation strategies for the Atlantic Rain Forest. This study tested whether the organization of the social paper wasp assemblage fits those centers. A standardized protocol was used for sampling the social paper wasp fauna. The structural organization was estimated by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) based on the similarity indexes of Sorensen (qualitative data) and Morisita-Horn (quantitative data). Regressive models were applied to the first axes\xe2\x80\x99 site scores of the NMDS, to the latitudinal and altitudinal variations, and to the speciation and immigration probabilities predicted by the neutral theory for a metacommunity. Our results indicated that the social paper wasp assemblage is organized in a continuum, with two distinct biodiversity centers. The organization of the assemblage along the gradient was dependent on latitudinal and altitudinal variations and their interactions, and also on the speciation and immigration probabilities. Several studies have demonstrated that the current biodiversity patterns of the Atlantic Forest might be explained by the past climate and, consequently, by the connection between the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest. In addition, speciation and immigration probabilities strongly influence the compositional and structural variations of the social paper wasp assemblage along the latitudinal gradient.'

Abstract: 'The rainforest of French Guiana is still largely unaffected by human activity. Various pristine sites like the Paracou Research Station are devoted to study this tropical ecosystem. We used culture-independent techniques, like polymerase chain reaction-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, and construction of clone libraries of partial 16S rRNA and nifH genes, to analyze the composition of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of mature trees of Eperua falcata and Dicorynia guianensis, both species within the Caesalpiniaceae family. E. falcata is one of the more abundant pioneer tree species in this ecosystem and so far, no root nodules have ever been found. However, its nitrogen-fixing status is regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cuncertain\xe2\x80\x9d, whereas D. guianensis is clearly considered a non-nitrogen-fixing plant. The rhizospheres of these mature trees contain specific bacterial communities, including several currently found uncultured microorganisms. In these communities, there are putative nitrogen-fixing bacteria specifically associated to each tree: D. guianensis harbors several Rhizobium spp. and E. falcata members of the genera Burkholderia and Bradyrhizobium. In addition, nifH sequences in the rhizosphere of the latter tree were very diverse. Retrieved sequences were related to bacteria belonging to the \xce\xb1-, \xce\xb2-, and \xce\xb3-Proteobacteria in the E. falcata rhizoplane, whereas only two sequences related to \xce\xb3-Proteobacteria were found in D. guianensis. Differences in the bacterial communities and the abundance and diversity of nifH sequences in E. falcata rhizosphere suggest that this tree could obtain nitrogen through a nonnodulating bacterial interaction.'

Abstract: ' In the moist Neotropics, vertebrate frugivores have a much greater role in the dispersal of forest and successional woody plants than wind, and bats rather than birds play the dominant role in dispersing early successional species. I investigated whether these patterns also occurred in a Philippine montane rainforest and adjacent successional vegetation. I also asked whether seed mass was related to probability of dispersal between habitats. A greater number of woody species and stems in the forest produced vertebrate-dispersed seeds than wind-dispersed seeds. Although input of forest seeds into the successional area was dominated by vertebrate-dispersed seeds in terms of species richness, wind-dispersed seeds landed in densities 15\xc2\xa0times higher. Frugivorous birds dispersed more forest seeds and species into the successional area than bats, and more successional seeds and species into the forest. As expected, seed input declined with distance from source habitat. Low input of forest seeds into the successional area at the farthest distance sampled, 40\xc2\xa0m from forest edge, particularly for vertebrate-dispersed seeds, suggests very limited dispersal out of forest even into a habitat in which woody successional vegetation provides perches and fruit resources. For species of vertebrate-dispersed successional seeds, probability of dispersal into forest declined significantly with seed mass.'

Abstract: 'During 2009\xe2\x80\x932012, wild animals and their ticks were sampled in two areas within the Amazon biome of Brazil, in the states of Mato Grosso and Par\xc3\xa1. Animal tissues, blood, and ticks were molecularly tested for Rickettsia and Coxiella DNA. A total of 182 wild animals were sampled, comprising 28 mammalian, five avian, and three reptilian species. Animal tissues or blood were all negative for Rickettsia or Coxiella DNA. A total of 454 ticks (22 larvae, 226 nymphs, 127 males, 79 females) were collected from 52 (28.6\xc2\xa0%) animals, and identified into 15 species: Amblyomma cajennense, A. naponense, A. humerale, A. nodosum, A. goeldii, A. oblongoguttatum, A. longirostre, A. calcaratum, A. coelebs, A. pacae, A. geayii, A. rotundatum, A. auricularium, A. ovale, and Haemaphysalis juxtakochi. While no Coxiella DNA was identified in ticks, six Rickettsia species were detected in the ticks. \xe2\x80\x9cCandidatus Rickettsia amblyommii\xe2\x80\x9d was the most common agent, detected in four tick species, A. cajennense, A. auricularium, A. longirostre, and A. humerale. The second most common agent, R. bellii, was detected in A. humerale and A. naponense. Rickettsia rhipicephali was detected in H. juxtakochi, and R. felis in A. humerale. Two possible new Rickettsia species were detected in A. naponense ticks, namely, a novel spotted fever group agent close-related to R. africae in Par\xc3\xa1, and a novel Canadensis group agent in Mato Grosso. Results of the present study expand our knowledge on the tick fauna, and on the yet infantile knowledge of tick-borne rickettsiae in the Amazon biome.'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this article is to broadly outline a problem in the context of relatively recent activity in the Amazon Basin. My colleagues and I found the Policy Sciences framework to be a useful blueprint for comprehensive issue analysis. The five intellectual tasks of the policy-oriented approach to solving problems helped us to clarify the apparent goals of the primary actors involved; identify certain trends associated with the problem, including estimations of their magnitude and implications; understand several conditioning factors which could impact (or have already had an impact on) the achievement of the goals identified; recognize several projections anticipated from a normative standpoint in light of the trends examined; and make some observations, including possible strategies and their alternatives, which might enable the Shuar to maximize benefits and minimize costs.'

Abstract: 'Here we present the within-site, seasonal, and interannual variations of the carbon (\xce\xb413C) and nitrogen (\xce\xb415N) isotope ratios of leaves, wood, bark and litter from four sites in the Amazon region, Brazil. Samples were collected in Manaus (3\xc2\xb0 06\xe2\x80\xb207\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2\xc2\xa0S; 60\xc2\xb001\xe2\x80\xb230\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2\xc2\xa0W), Ji-Paran\xc3\xa1 (10\xc2\xb053\xe2\x80\xb207\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2\xc2\xa0S; 61\xc2\xb057\xe2\x80\xb206\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2\xc2\xa0W), and Santar\xc3\xa9m (2\xc2\xb026\xe2\x80\xb235\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2\xc2\xa0S; 54\xc2\xb042\xe2\x80\xb230\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2\xc2\xa0W) with mean annual precipitation of 2207, 2040 and 1909\xc2\xa0mm respectively. The overall average for all leaf samples was\n\\(-32.3\\pm2.5\\permille\\) for \xce\xb413C and\n\\(+5.8\\pm1.6\\permille\\) for \xce\xb415N (n=756). The leaf \xce\xb4 values at these sites were often but not always statistically distinct from each other. The \xce\xb413C values varied from\n\\(-37.8\\permille\\) to\n\\(-25.9\\permille\\). Pronounced differences in \xce\xb413C values occurred with height associated with differences in forest structure. The \xce\xb413C of leaf dry matter showed seasonal variations associated with the length of the dry season, despite the fact that total annual precipitation was similar among the studied sites. Leaf \xce\xb415N values ranged from\n\\(+0.9\\permille\\) to a maximum value of\n\\(+10.9\\permille\\), and the Santar\xc3\xa9m sites showed more enriched values than Manaus and Ji-Paran\xc3\xa1 sites. No seasonal variation was detected in the \xce\xb415N of leaves, but significant differences were observed among sites and with changes in canopy height. The isotope ratio data are consistent with our current understanding of the roles of light, water availability, and recycling of soil-respired CO2 influences on \xce\xb413C and consistent with our understanding that an open nitrogen cycle can lead to high \xce\xb415N values despite a significant number of legumes in the vegetation.'

Abstract: 'In order to better understand how flooding and gap formation affect Amazonian rainforests, I set up plots both in three major forest types that differed by flooding duration (referred to here as dry, wet, very wet) and in their respective gaps. Sampling of those plots after 4 years of regeneration showed: (1) common species exist between wet forests and their gaps and between wet and very wet gaps, (2) tree richness is maximum in dry forest and minimum in very wet gaps except in the wet gaps that show the second highest number of species, (3) there were less stems in gaps compared to forests and less stems in forests as flooding increased, except again in the wet gaps, and (4) dominance-diversity curves have more dominance by single species in the dry gap plots compared to other gaps and in dry forest compared to other forests. In general while some aspects of structure such as tree stem density is largely determined by tree-fall gap dynamics, tree composition is determined by flooding regime. Finally a jump in tree richness in wet forests and wet gaps compared to other plots suggests a \xe2\x80\x9cmass effects\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis where species from dry and very wet forest and gaps have overlapping ranges in the wet forest and gap. This effect may help explain the high species diversity seen in this part of the Amazon.'

Abstract: 'Several studies have identified a recent lengthening of the dry season over the southern Amazon during the last three decades. Some explanations to this lengthening suggest the influence of changes in the regional circulation over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, whereas others point to the influence of vegetation changes over the Amazon rainforest. This study aims to understand the implications of more frequent long dry seasons in this forest on atmospheric moisture transport toward northern South America and the Caribbean region. Using a semi-Langrangian model for water vapor tracking, results indicate that longer dry seasons in the southern Amazon relate to reductions of water vapor content over the southern and eastern Amazon basin, due to significant reductions of evaporation and recycled precipitation rates in these regions, especially during the transition from dry to wet conditions in the southern Amazon. On the other hand, longer dry seasons also relate to enhanced atmospheric moisture content over the Caribbean and northern South America regions, mainly due to increased contributions of water vapor from oceanic regions and the increase of surface moisture convergence over the equatorial region. This highlights the importance of understanding the relative role of regional circulation and local surface conditions on modulating water vapor transport toward continental regions.'

Abstract: "Soil fertility restoration depends on natural fallows in the slash-and-burn system of eastern Madagascar. In the Beforona-Vohidrazana study zone, none of the fallow species are able to withstand the slashing, burning and cropping frequencies of 3\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0years. Eventually soils are abandoned for agriculture. Along the degradation sequence, this study quantifies fallow biomass, nutrient stocks and soil nutrient availability of four dominant fallow species Trema orientalis, Psiadia altissima, Rubus moluccanus, and Imperata cylindrica. At 3\xc2\xa0years, the shrubs Psiadia and Rubus were more productive (11\xe2\x80\x9314.4\xc2\xa0t/ha aboveground biomass or AGB) than the tree species Trema (8.5\xc2\xa0t/ha). Only after 5\xc2\xa0years did tree productivity (24.7\xc2\xa0t/ha) exceed that of shrubs (17\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0t/ha). Imperata\xe2\x80\x99s biomass stagnated at 5.5\xc2\xa0t/ha after 3\xc2\xa0years. A sharp decline in fallow productivity was observed with advancing fallow cycles after deforestation. While Psiadia produced highest AGB in the second fallow cycle (C2) being 100%, C1 achieved 89% of that, C3 74%, and C4 only 29%. With the ability to propagate vegetatively and to accumulate important amounts of nutrients in roots, Rubus and Imperata, both exotic and invasive species, showed improved adaptation mechanisms towards frequent disturbances compared to the two indigenous species Trema and Psiadia. Available soil nutrients P, K, Mg were highest under forest and declined rapidly with increasing fallow cycles. Ca and pH rose momentarily in the first fallow cycle before declining with advanced soil use. Al concentrations increased steadily with time. As lengthened fallow periods are not practical, there is a need to intensify upland systems based on improved nutrient cycling, targeted inputs, fire-less land management, and land use diversification. Allowing regrading tree and bush fallows to accumulate biomass (above- and belowground carbon) will significantly improve Madagascar's greenhouse gas mitigation contribution."

Abstract: 'The Amazon Region is the domaine of tropical rainforest. The urgent need for ecosystem research in natural forests has been identified as a tool for the study of the biosphere and its components. Such research will provide a more adequate insight into the structure and functioning of the ecosystems and the knowledge gained can be used in planning ecologically sound development and in its execution (Schubert, 1977). Emphasis was given to the terra firma forest, specifically to terra firma forests in southern Venezuela where ecosystem research has been carried out.'

Abstract: 'We used palm knowledge to understand the interaction between people and the rainforests and the factors that influence this dynamic process. We interviewed 278 informants in 12 villages in the Pastaza and Madidi areas of the western Amazon basin. Together they used 38 different palm species for 38 different uses in six use-categories (food, construction, utensils, ritual, medicine, commercial). Euterpe precatoria, Iriartea deltoidea, and Oenocarpus bataua were best known and were mentioned as useful by 76\xe2\x80\x9372% of the informants in the 12 villages. There was a great variation in number of uses and in how widespread the uses were and five of the 38 useful palms were mentioned by only one informant. Among the socioeconomic factors analyzed, the residence village influenced the informants\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge of palms and their uses more than any other factor. Length of education, prosperity and for how long the informant had lived in the village were also positively correlated to how many palms and palm uses were known. Gender differences in informants\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge of palm uses were not observed in our data. We suggest, that the high importance of forest products to the livelihood of the villagers, the great variation in the knowledge they possess, and the fact that the differences between villages is so great, are important elements to consider when developing management plans for the sustainable use of the rainforest resources in the western Amazon.'

Abstract: 'The assessment of species rarity considers local abundance (scarce or abundant population), habitat affinity (stenoecious or euryecious species), and geographic distribution (stenotopic or eurytopic species). When analyzed together these variables classify species into eight categories, from common species to those having small populations, unique habitats, and restricted geographic distribution (form 7), as proposed by Rabinowitz in 1981. Based on these categories, it is possible to calculate the frequency of the different forms of rarity of the species present in a given site. The Brazilian Atlantic rainforest is considered a hotspot of the world biodiversity harboring many endemic species, which have restricted geographic distribution. Our objective was to identify the forms of rarity of tree species and their proportions in the southern portion of the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest using Rabinowitz\xe2\x80\x99s forms of rarity. All the seven forms of rarity are present in the 846 tree species we analyzed: 46% eurytopic and 54% stenotopic, 73% euryecious and 27% stenoecious, 76% locally abundant and 24% locally scarce species. Eurytopic, euryecious locally abundant species accounted for 41.1%, whereas 58.9% were somehow rare: 4.5% eurytopic, euryecious locally scarce, 0.2% eurytopic, stenoecious locally abundant, 0.1% eurytopic, stenoecious locally scarce, 19.5% stenotopic, euryecious locally abundant, 8.0% stenotopic, euryecious locally scarce, 15.6% stenotopic, stenoecious locally abundant, and 11.0% stenotopic, stenoecious locally scarce. Considering that the most restrictive forms of rarity precedes extinction, the application of Rabinowitz\xe2\x80\x99s system demonstrated that most tree species of the southern Brazilian Atlantic rainforest are threatened due to their restricted geographic distribution, restriction to a single habitat, reduced local abundance, or even to a combination of these variables.'

Abstract: 'Organic nutrients have proven to contribute significantly to nutrient cycling in temperate forest ecosystems. Still, little is known about their relevance in the tropics. In the present study, organic C, N, S and P were analysed in rainfall, throughfall, litter percolate and soil solution of a montane rainforest at Mt.\xc2\xa0Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. The aim was to determine the amounts of organic nutrients in different water pathways and to assess the influence of forest disturbance on organic nutrients by comparing mature forests, secondary forests and shrub vegetation in clearings. Concentrations of all studied elements increased from rainfall to throughfall and litter percolate and then exhibited a rapid decrease in the mineral soil. Concentrations of organic P were above the detection limit only in the litter percolate. Organic N (ON) as a fraction of total N increased from 50% in rainfall (0.19\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921) to 66% (0.45\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921) in throughfall followed by a decline to 39% in the litter percolate (0.77\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921) of the mature forest. Similarly, proportions of organic S and P amounted to 43 and 34%, respectively, in the litter percolate in mature forest. For ON, this proportion further decreased to less than 10% in the soil solution. The latter was probably attributable to a high sorption capacity of the studied Andisols, which led to overall low organic element concentrations in the soil solution (OC: 1.2\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921, ON: 0.05\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 at 1\xc2\xa0m soil depth) as compared to other temperate and tropical forest ecosystems. Organic element concentrations were higher in litter percolate and soil solution under the clearings, but there were no differences in the relative contribution of these elements. Organic nutrient forms at Mt.\xc2\xa0Kilimanjaro appeared to be much less susceptible to leaching than their inorganic forms.'

Abstract: ' Canopy CO2 concentrations in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana were measured continuously for 5 days during the 1994 dry season and the 1995 wet season. Carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]) throughout the canopy (0.02\xe2\x80\x9338 m) showed a distinct daily pattern, were well-stratified and decreased with increasing height into the canopy. During both seasons, daytime [CO2] in the upper and middle canopy decreased on average 7\xe2\x80\x9310 \xce\xbcmol mol\xe2\x88\x921 below tropospheric baseline values measured at Barbados. Within the main part of the canopy (\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x890.7 m), [CO2] did not differ between the wet and dry seasons. In contrast, [CO2] below 0.7 m were generally higher during the dry season, resulting in larger [CO2] gradients. Supporting this observation, soil CO2 efflux was on average higher during the dry season than during the wet season, either due to diffusive limitations and/or to oxygen deficiency of root and microbial respiration. Soil respiration rates decreased by 40% after strong rain events, resulting in a rapid decrease in canopy [CO2] immediately above the forest floor of about 50\xe2\x90\xa3\xce\xbcmol mol\xe2\x88\x921. Temporal and spatial variations in [CO2]canopy were reflected in changes of \xce\xb413Ccanopy and \xce\xb418Ocanopy values. Tight relationships were observed between \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb418O of canopy CO2 during both seasons (r2\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.86). The most depleted \xce\xb413Ccanopy and \xce\xb418Ocanopy values were measured immediately above the forest floor (\xce\xb413C\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x9216.4\xe2\x80\xb0; \xce\xb418O\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8939.1\xe2\x80\xb0 SMOW). Gradients in the isotope ratios of CO2 between the top of the canopy and the forest floor ranged between 2.0\xe2\x80\xb0 and 6.3\xe2\x80\xb0 for \xce\xb413C, and between 1.0\xe2\x80\xb0 and 3.5\xe2\x80\xb0 for \xce\xb418O. The \xce\xb413Cleaf and calculated ci/ca of foliage at three different positions were similar for the dry and wet seasons indicating that the canopy maintained a constant ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance. About 20% of the differences in \xce\xb413Cleaf within the canopy was accounted for by source air effects, the remaining 80% must be due to changes in ci/ca. Plotting 1/[CO2] vs. the corresponding \xce\xb413C ratios resulted in very tight, linear relationships (r2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.99), with no significant differences between the two seasons, suggesting negligible seasonal variability in turbulent mixing relative to ecosystem gas exchange. The intercepts of these relationships that should be indicative of the \xce\xb413C of respired sources were close to the measured \xce\xb413C of soil respired CO2 and to the \xce\xb413C of litter and soil organic matter. Estimates of carbon isotope discrimination of the entire ecosystem, \xce\x94e, were calculated as 20.3\xe2\x80\xb0 during the dry season and as 20.5\xe2\x80\xb0 during the wet  season.'

Abstract: 'While conducting projects on ticks from deer and on tick ecology in animal trails in an Atlantic rainforest reserve in Southeastern Brazil, researchers of our group were bitten by ticks several times. Some of these episodes were recorded. Three species of adult ticks attached to humans: Amblyomma brasiliense Arag\xc3\xa3o, Amblyomma incisum Neumann, and Amblyomma ovale Koch. Eight nymphal attachments with engorgement on humans were recorded. From these, six molted to adults of A. incisum, one to an adult of A. brasiliense, and one had an anomalous molting, therefore the adult tick could not be properly identified. Local reactions to tick attachment varied among individual hosts from almost imperceptible to intense. Especially itching, but hyperemia and swelling as well, were prominent features of the reaction. Overall it can be affirmed that human beings can be a physiologically suitable host species for ticks in the Atlantic rainforest and that itching was an important if not the major component of the resistance to tick bite.'

Abstract: 'We summarize a long-term study of the effects of edge creation on establishment of the economically important arboreal palm Oenocarpus bacaba in an experimentally fragmented landscape in central Amazonia. Recruitment and mortality of large individuals (\xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm diameter-at-breast-height) were recorded within 21 1-ha plots in fragmented and intact forests for periods of up to 22\xc2\xa0years. In addition, 12 small (0.7\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa014\xc2\xa0m) sub-plots within each 1-ha plot were used to enumerate the abundance of seedlings and saplings (5\xe2\x80\x93400\xc2\xa0cm tall). On average, the recruitment of large trees was over two times faster near forest edges, leading to a sharp (90%) increase in the mean population density of large individuals near forest edges, whereas the density of larger trees remained constant in the forest interior. Overall seedling and sapling density was significantly lower in edge than interior plots, but edge plots had a much higher proportion of larger (>100\xc2\xa0cm tall) saplings. Our findings demonstrate that forest edges can have complex effects on tree demography and that one must consider all tree life stages in order to effectively assess their effects on plant populations.'

Abstract: 'The sustainability of agroforestry systems in Amazonia was assessed from their litter dynamics and decomposition. Litter fall and litter stocks were determined from July 1997 to March 1999 in four sites in central Amazonia: a primary rainforest, a 13-year-old secondary forest, and two sites of a polyculture forestry system which consisted of four planted tree species of commercial use amidst upcoming secondary growth. The average annual litter fall in the undisturbed primary rainforest (FLO) was 8.4 t ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921, which is within the range of litter fall in other rainforests in the region. It was similar in one of the two polyculture sites (8.3 t ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921), but lower in the secondary forest and in the second polyculture site. In the litter fall in secondary forest and agroforestry sites, the leaf portion was higher (76\xe2\x80\x9382% of total litter fall) than in FLO, due to reduced fine matter and wood fall. Leaf litter fall variability was much lower in the plantation sites than in the forests, which is explained by the much more homogeneous stand structure of the plantations. The quality of the produced litter, measured as C/N ratio, differed significantly between the primary forest site and one polyculture and the secondary forest site. The cumulative input of nitrogen through litter fall was 144 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921 in FLO, and 91\xe2\x80\x93112 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921 in the polycultures and the secondary forest. Litter fall was not correlated with soil parameters, but had a significant linear regression with canopy closure. For the primary rainforest, litter fall was also (inversely) correlated with monthly rainfall. Litter fall was higher in the first year (1997\xe2\x80\x931998; an El Ni\xc3\xb1o period) than in 1998\xe2\x80\x931999. Litter stocks on the forest floor were highest in the secondary forest (24.7 t ha\xe2\x88\x921), and much lower in the polyculture sites (15.1\xe2\x80\x9316.2 t ha\xe2\x88\x921) and the primary forest (12.0 t ha\xe2\x88\x921). There were no differences in the relative N content (C/N ratio) of the litter stocks between the sites, but the larger stocks led to higher absolute N contents in the litter layer in the secondary forest. From the monthly values of litter stocks (S) and litter fall (P), the decomposition coefficient ke=P/S was calculated, which was, on average, highest for the primary forest (0.059), followed by the polyculture systems (0.040\xe2\x80\x930.042), and by the secondary forest (0.024). Thus, due to low decomposition rates, the secondary forest site showed large litter accumulations in spite of a relatively low litter fall. In contrast, the primary forest showed high litter fall but low stocks, due to high decomposition rates. The decomposition coefficients of the polyculture systems ranged between the primary and the secondary forest. The reduced decomposition rates in the man-managed agroecosystems indicate quantitative and/or qualitative changes in the decomposer communities of these systems that lead to a higher build-up of litter stocks on the forest floor. However, the decomposer systems in the polyculture sites still were more functional than in the site of non-managed secondary growth. Thus, from a soil biological viewpoint, ecologically sustainable low-input agroforestry in Amazonia will benefit from the application of these polyculture systems.'

Abstract: 'The hydrochemical responses to slash-and-burnagriculture in a small rainforest catchment of thecentral Amazon were investigated for one year. Disturbances in the partially deforested catchmentbegan in 1987, and during the study a 2-ha plot was cut(July 1989) and burned (October 1989) in preparationfor the cultivation of manioc; the partially deforestedcatchment was approximately 80% deforested at the timeof this study. Solute fluxes exported by base flowwere estimated from solute concentrations of stream watermeasured at least once per week. Solute fluxesfor storm flow were estimated by measuring streamwaterconcentrations during two storms. Baseflow runoffrepresented about 94% of the water outflow from thestudy basin and was the dominant pathway of soluteexport. Total rainfall during the study period was2754 mm of which 2080 mm was exported from thepartially deforested catchment as stream runoff. Theratio of surface runoff to annual rainfall for asimilar study conducted in the same catchment whilecompletely forested in 1984 was lower than after thecatchment was 80% deforested in 1990 (0.57 versus0.76), while evapotranspiration (ET) was lower by about afactor of two in 1990 compared to 1984. Particulateremoval from the partially deforested catchment was 151kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 yr\xe2\x88\x921. Nutrient losses from thepartially deforested catchment were higher than thosemeasured when the catchment was undisturbed in 1984 byfactors of 1.4, 1.8, and 2.1 for total inorganicnitrogen (TIN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and totalnitrogen (TN); and by factors of 4.0, 6.6, and 7.9 for solublereactive phosphate (PO3\xe2\x88\x924), total dissolvedphosphorus (TDP), and total phosphorus (TP),respectively. These data show that deforestation andcolonization in upland catchments of the central Amazonalter the hydrochemical balance of streams bydecreasing ET, thereby increasing discharge and soluteexport.'

Abstract: 'In this article we look at the destruction of the Amazon forest through an archaeological lens. We describe the devastation brought about by illegal loggers and ranchers to the last remaining old-growth forests of Maranh\xc3\xa3o (NE Brazil), where the Aw\xc3\xa1 hunter-gatherers live. We argue that archaeology can provide an alternative and more critical look at global consumerism by manifesting the crude materiality and abject violence that lurks behind the goods consumed in the West. We followed the tracks of a group of loggers deep inside the forest and report what we saw.'

Abstract: 'This study documents regional patterns in stream nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the Brazilian state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia in the southwestern Amazon basin, and interprets the patterns as functions of watershed soil properties, deforestation extent, and urban population density. The survey includes 77 different locations sampled in the dry and wet seasons, with a watershed size range from 1.8 to 33,000\xe2\x80\x89km2 over a total area of approximately 140,000\xe2\x80\x89km2. A sequential regression technique is used to separate the effects of natural watersheds properties and anthropogenic disturbance on nutrients and chloride. Natural variation in soil texture explains most of the variance in stream nitrate concentrations, while deforestation extent and urban population density explain most of the variance in stream chloride (Cl) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations. Stream TDN, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), particulate phosphorus (PP) and Cl concentrations all increase non-linearly with deforestation extent in the dry season after controlling for natural variability due to soil type. Stream nutrient and Cl disturbances are observed only in watersheds more than 66\xe2\x80\x9375% deforested (watershed area range 2\xe2\x80\x93300\xe2\x80\x89km2), suggesting stream nutrient concentrations are resistant to perturbation from vegetation conversion below a 66\xe2\x80\x9375% threshold. In heavily deforested watersheds, stream Cl shows the largest changes in concentration (12\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x896 times forested background), followed by TDP (2.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.5), PP (1.9\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.8) and TDN (1.7\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.5). Wet season signals in Cl and TDP are diluted relative to the dry season, and no land use signal is observed in wet season TDN, PN, or PP. Stream TDN and TDP concentrations in non-urban watersheds both correlate with stream Cl, suggesting that sources other than vegetation and soil organic matter contribute to enhanced nutrient concentrations. Small, urbanized watersheds (5\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x89km2) have up to 40 times the chloride and 10 times the TDN concentrations of forested catchments in the dry season. Several large watersheds (\xe2\x88\xbc1000\xe2\x80\x933000\xe2\x80\x89km2) with urban populations show higher Cl, TDN and TDP levels than any small pasture watershed, suggesting that human impacts on nutrient concentrations in large river systems may be dominated by urban areas. Anthropogenic disturbance of dry-season stream Cl and TDN is detectable in large streams draining deforested and urbanized watersheds up to 33,000\xe2\x80\x89km2. We conclude that regional deforestation and urbanization result in changes in stream Cl, N and P concentrations at wide range of scales, from small pasture streams to large river systems.'

Abstract: '\nRainforest tree species are often found on poor soils where essential nutrients may be in low concentrations. Here, we determine the effect of nutrients (N, P, Ca, Mg and K) in photosynthetic traits in five rainforest tree species from central Amazonia. Gas exchange parameters were measured with an infrared gas analyzer in four saplings (1\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0m tall) per species using two leaves per plant. Data on gas exchange and leaf nutrient content (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) were collected between August and November, 2010. Specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf thickness (L T) were also determined. Potential photosynthesis per unit mass (A pot-mass), maximum carboxylation velocity of Rubisco (V c-max) and electron transport rate (J max) were responsive to variation in leaf nutrient content per unit mass. On a mass basis, P content was positively correlated with N, Mg, and K content; Mg content was positively correlated with K content. However, no correlation was found between the content of P, Mg, K and Ca, or between Ca, Mg, K and N. SLA and L T were strongly related to A pot-area, V c-max and J max (per unit area). Our study shows in situ evidence on the effect of leaf nutrients on A pot-mass, V c-max and J max (per unit mass) of tree saplings in the central Amazon. The magnitude of changes in photosynthetic capacity of juvenile trees in the forest understory depends not only on N and P use efficiency, but also on the availability of K, Mg and Ca, in decreasing order.'

Abstract: 'Roads are an increasingly common feature of forest landscapes all over the world, and while information accumulates regarding the impacts of roads globally, there remains a paucity of information within tropical regions. Here we investigate the potential for biodiversity impacts from an unmarked road within a rainforest protected area in Western Amazonia. We focus on three key taxonomic groups; amphibians, butterflies and birds, each of which have been shown to be both sensitive and reliable indicators of forest disturbance. In total, 315 amphibians of 26 different species, 348 butterflies of 65 different species, 645 birds representing 77 different species were captured using mist netting and 877 bird records representing 79 different species were recorded using point counts. We provide evidence to show that the presence of a small unmarked road significantly altered levels of faunal species richness, diversity, relative abundance and community structure. This was true to a varying degree for all three taxa, up to and potentially beyond 350\xc2\xa0m into the forest interior. Responses to the road were shown to be taxon specific. We found increasing proximity to the road had a negative effect on amphibian and understorey bird communities, whilst butterfly and overall diurnal bird communities responded positively. We show that the impact on biodiversity extends up to at least 32\xc2\xa0% of the whole reserve area; a serious impact under any scenario. This work provides support for recently voiced calls to limit networks of unmarked roads in order to realistically and effectively preserve natural levels of tropical biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'We describe and illustrate Lesia tepuiensis, a new species of subshrub from rock outcrops of the Serra do Arac\xc3\xa1 tepui in Amazonas, Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses based on 7219-aligned base pairs of the plastid and nuclear DNA sequences recovered the new species as sister to Lesia savannarum, the type species of Lesia, a genus recently described as monotypic. The new species is readily distinguished from L. savannarum by having a red, pouched corolla tube, lanceolate calyx lobes, a hirsute to tomentose leaf indument and a rupicolous habit. Phylogenetic analyses of the relationships of Lesia with other genera in the subtribe Columneinae indicated that Lesia and Codonanthopsis form a monophyletic group sister to a clade endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic forest formed by Nematanthus and Codonanthe. The pouched corolla tube found in the genera Lesia and Nematanthus appears to have evolved independently in these two lineages. Ecological and distributional data, as well as a key to the species of Lesia and related genera, are also provided.'

Abstract: 'Does the use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) lead to species conservation and protection of the tropical rain forest? This paper examines the use and fate of the chambira palm (Astrocaryum chambira) \xe2\x80\x93 a prime candidate for \xe2\x80\x98conservation-through-use\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x93 around a traditional peasant community in northeastern Peru where land scarcity has forced households to draw increasingly on NTFPs to supplement their incomes, including palm fibre for the production of handicrafts. Using household survey data (n = 36), we identify the specific factors that influence handicraft production, household use and economic reliance on palm fibre-based handicrafts, and the planting (semi-domestification) of the chambira palm. Our findings question the promise of rain forest \xe2\x80\x98conservation-through-use\xe2\x80\x99 and indicate the scope of challenges for species conservation, particularly among the rural poor.'

Abstract: 'In the Amazon rainforest, biodiversity is a significant resource for traditional communities, as it can be used as a relevant source of protein and it has a promising zootherapeutic potential. Studies on knowledge and ways how local peoples use the fauna are still incipient. This paper presents both the knowledge on and food and medicinal uses of common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) by riverine communities in an Amazon floodplain region.'

Abstract: 'Less destruction of the nutrient cycling root-mat in the swidden cycle, and its quicker re-formation in the fallow cycle.'

Abstract: 'In order to better understand the relative importance of different ecosystems and nitrogen cycling processes within the Amazon basin to the nitrogen economy of this region, we constructed a generalized nitrogen budget for the region based on data for hydrologic losses of nitrogen and nitrogen fixation in Amazon forests. Data included information available for nitrogen in water entering and leaving both the entire basin and watersheds on oxisol and ultisol soils near Manaus, Brazil, in addition to biological nitrogen fixation in forests on ultisol, oxisol and entisol (\xe2\x80\x98varzea\xe2\x80\x99) soils in Central Amazonia.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon is a vast region of about 7 million km2, encompassing nine countries in the northern part of South America. Around 70% of the Amazon, or approximately 5 million km2, are within the Brazilian National boundary (Figure 1). It is, in many aspects, a unique region characterised by the largest stock of biological diversity in the world, an extensive network of rivers, the persistence of traditional Indian population \xe2\x80\x94 some still isolated from contacts with modern society \xe2\x80\x94 and significant mineral reserves.'

Abstract: 'Rainfall variability over the Amazon basin has often been linked to variations in Pacific sea surface temperature (SST), and in particular, to the El Ni\xc3\xb1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, only a fraction of Amazon rainfall variability can be explained by ENSO. Building upon the recent work of Zeng  (Environ Res Lett 3:014002, 2008), here we provide further evidence for an influence on Amazon rainfall from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The strength of the North Atlantic influence is found to be comparable to the better-known Pacific ENSO connection. The tropical South Atlantic Ocean also shows some influence during the wet-to-dry season transition period. The Atlantic influence is through changes in the north-south divergent circulation and the movement of the ITCZ following warm SST. Therefore, it is strongest in the southern part of the Amazon basin during the Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s dry season (July\xe2\x80\x93October). In contrast, the ENSO related teleconnection is through anomalous east-west Walker circulation with largely concentrated in the eastern (lower) Amazon. This ENSO connection is seasonally locked to boreal winter. A complication due to the influence of ENSO on Atlantic SST causes an apparent North Atlantic SST lag of Amazon rainfall. Removing ENSO from North Atlantic SST via linear regression resolves this causality problem in that the residual Atlantic variability correlates well and is in phase with the Amazon rainfall. A strong Atlantic influence during boreal summer and autumn is particularly significant in terms of the impact on the hydro-ecosystem which is most vulnerable during the dry season, as highlighted by the severe 2005 Amazon drought. Such findings have implications for both seasonal-interannual climate prediction and understanding the longer-term changes of the Amazon rainforest.'

Abstract: 'A new species of Araceae, Rhodospatha arborescens, was found in two preservation areas in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, Caratinga Biological Station and Rio Doce State Park, both located in a semideciduous seasonal forest (Interior Atlantic Rainforest). The new species is helophytic and arborescent. It is described, illustrated, and compared with Rhodospatha species that occur in the Atlantic Rainforest, using a dichotomous key. Information is also presented on the geographic distribution, ecology, and phenology these species.'

Abstract: ' Ant-plant interactions in the canopy of a lowland Amazonian rainforest of the upper Orinoco, Venezuela, were studied using a modified commercial crane on rails (Surumoni project). Our observations show a strong correlation between plant sap exudates and both abundance of ants and co-occurrence of ant species in tree canopies. Two types of plant sap sources were compared: extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and honeydew secretions by homopterans. EFNs were a frequent food source for ants on epiphytes (Philodendron spp., Araceae) and lianas (Dioclea, Fabaceae), but rare on canopy trees in the study area, whereas the majority of trees were host to aggregations of homopterans tended by honeydew-seeking ants (on 62% of the trees examined). These aggregations rarely occurred on epiphytes. Baited ant traps were installed on plants with EFNs and in the crowns of trees from three common genera, including trees with and without ant-tended homopterans: Goupia glabra (Celastraceae), Vochysia spp. (Vochysiaceae), and Xylopia spp. (Annonaceae). The number of ant workers per trap was significantly higher on plants offering one of the two plant sap sources than on trees without such resources. Extrafloral nectaries were used by a much broader spectrum of ant species and genera than honeydew, and co-occurrence of ant species (in traps) was significantly higher on plants bearing EFNs than on trees. Homopteran honeydew (Coccidae and Membracidae), on the other hand, was mostly monopolised by a single ant colony per tree. Homopteran-tending ants were generally among the most dominant ants in the canopy. The most prominent genera were Azteca, Dolichoderus (both Dolichoderinae), Cephalotes, Pheidole, Crematogaster (all Myrmicinae), and Ectatomma (Ponerinae). Potential preferences were recorded between ant and homopteran species, and also between ant-homopteran associations and tree genera. We hypothesize that the high availability of homopteran honeydew provides a key resource for ant mosaics, where dominant ant colonies and species maintain mutually exclusive territories on trees. In turn, we propose that for nourishment of numerous ants of lower competitive capacity, Philodendron and other sources of EFNs might be particularly important.'

Abstract: 'To study the noteworthy nest building behavior of the nymph of the Brazilian Rainforest cicada Guyalna chlorogena (Walker) during the last year of its underground life, we monitored a large number of edifices, consisting of a vertical well (up to 1\xc2\xa0m deep) with a turret (20 to 40\xc2\xa0cm tall) on top, and we also performed experiments. We have shown that the buildings are occupied by a single nymph, male or female, which increases the height of its turret each night by about 3\xc2\xa0cm, during a short active growing phase. The nymph softens and reshapes the apex by pushing upwards a lump of freshly mixed soaked clay, without any opening present, i. e., without ever exposing itself to the outside. We also established that the nymph is very active once its building is achieved. For example, it restores the height of the turret to its original value when shortening and opens the top of its building in case of variation of environmental parameters. Finally, we have shown how the nymph opens its edifice to reach the outside for molting into an adult stage (imago). With this work, we contributed to a better understanding of the nesting behavior of Amazon cicadas.'

Abstract: 'Vespoidea are the most functionally diverse superfamily of Hymenoptera. Ecological studies involving this family are primarily based on eusocial groups, including ants and social paper wasps. In the present study, we examine stinging wasp (Vespoidea) faunal diversity in the Atlantic Rain Forest, which is one of the most diverse and threatened ecosystems in the World. Three conservation areas were sampled employing a standardized sample protocol. Families and functional groups of Vespoidea were collected in each area, with the exception ants (Formicidae), and analyzed using diversity analyses, to generate taxonomic diversity and distinctness indices. Results indicated Pompilidae was the most diverse family, and the idiobiont parasitoid type was the most diverse functional group in the three study areas. N\xc3\xbacleo Picinguaba of the Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar was taxonomically and functionally the most diverse and species rich area. Parque Estadual Intervales showed the highest number of dominant species and diversity of koinobiont parasitoids, while the Rebio Sooretama exhibited a decrease in several diversity parameters.'

Abstract: 'To assess the role of shifting cultivation in the loss of rainforests in Indonesia, we examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of traditional land-use north of Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan. We analyzed the abundance, size, frequency, and stature (by tree size) of discrete management units (patches) as a function of land-use category and distance from the village. Data were gathered from point samples along six 1.5-km transects through the landscape surrounding the Dayak village of Kembera. Most land was managed for rice, with 5&percnt; in current production, 12&percnt; in wet-rice fallows (regenerating swamp forest), and 62&percnt; in dry-rice fallows (regenerating upland forest). The proportion of land in dry-rice increased with distance from the village; rubber gardens (17&percnt; of the total area), dominated close to the village. The size of rubber trees declined with distance, reflecting the recent establishment of rubber gardens far from the village. Fruit gardens accounted for only 4&percnt; of the area. From interviews in Kembera and three other villages, we estimated rates of primary forest clearing and documented changes in land-use. Most rice fields were cleared from secondary forest fallows. However, 17&percnt; of dry-rice fields and 9&percnt; of wet-rice fields were cleared from primary forest in 1990, resulting in the loss of approximately 12 ha of primary forest per village. Almost all dry-rice fields cleared from primary forest were immediately converted to rubber gardens, as were 39&percnt; of all dry-rice fields cleared from fallows. The rate of primary forest conversion increased dramatically from 1990 to 1995, due not to soil degradation or population growth but rather to changes in the socio-economic and political environment faced by shifting cultivators. Although the loss of primary forest is appreciable under shifting cultivation, the impact is less than that of the major alternative land-uses in the region: timber extraction and oil palm plantations.'

Abstract: ' Functional aspects of biodiversity were investigated in a lowland tropical rainforest in French Guyana (5\xc2\xb02\xe2\x80\xb2N, annual precipitation 2200\xe2\x80\x89mm). We assessed leaf \xce\xb415N as a presumptive indicator of symbiotic N2 fixation, and leaf and wood cellulose \xce\xb413C as an indicator of leaf intrinsic water-use efficiency (CO2 assimilation rate/leaf conductance for water vapour) in dominant trees of 21 species selected for their representativeness in the forest cover, their ecological strategy (pioneers or late successional stage species, shade tolerance) or their potential ability for N2 fixation. Similar measurements were made in trees of native species growing in a nearby plantation after severe perturbation (clear cutting, mechanical soil disturbance). Bulk soil \xce\xb415N was spatially quite uniform in the forest (range 3\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\xb0), whereas average leaf \xce\xb415N ranged from \xe2\x88\x920.3\xe2\x80\xb0 to 3.5\xe2\x80\xb0 in the different species. Three species only, Diplotropis purpurea, Recordoxylon speciosum (Fabaceae), and Sclerolobium melinonii (Caesalpiniaceae), had root bacterial nodules, which was also associated with leaf N concentrations higher than 20\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89g\xe2\x88\x921. Although nodulated trees displayed significantly lower leaf \xce\xb415N values than non-nodulated trees, leaf \xce\xb415N did not prove a straightforward indicator of symbiotic fixation, since there was a clear overlap of \xce\xb415N values for nodulated and non-nodulated species at the lower end of the \xce\xb415N range. Perturbation did not markedly affect the difference \xce\xb415Nsoil\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xb415Nleaf, and thus the isotopic data provide no evidence of an alteration in the different N acquisition patterns. Extremely large interspecific differences in sunlit leaf \xce\xb413C were observed in the forest (average values from \xe2\x88\x9231.4 to \xe2\x88\x9226.7\xe2\x80\xb0), corresponding to intrinsic water-use efficiencies (ratio CO2 assimilation rate/leaf conductance for water vapour) varying over a threefold range. Wood cellulose \xce\xb413C was positively related to total leaf \xce\xb413C, the former values being 2\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\xb0 higher than the latter ones. Leaf \xce\xb413C was not related to leaf \xce\xb415N at either intraspecific or interspecific levels. \xce\xb413C of sunlit leaves was highest in shade hemitolerant emergent species and was lower in heliophilic, but also in shade-tolerant species. For a given species, leaf \xce\xb413C did not differ between the pristine forest and the disturbed plantation conditions. Our results are not in accord with the concept of existence of functional types of species characterized by common suites of traits underlying niche differentiation; rather, they support the hypothesis that each trait leads to a separate grouping of species.'

Abstract: 'Tropical rainforest plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, accounting for a large part of global net primary productivity and contributing to CO2 sequestration. The objective of this work is to simulate potential changes in the rainforest biome in Central America subject to anthropogenic climate change under two emissions scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The use of a dynamic vegetation model and climate change scenarios is an approach to investigate, assess or anticipate how biomes respond to climate change. In this work, the Inland dynamic vegetation model was driven by the Eta regional climate model simulations. These simulations accept boundary conditions from HadGEM2-ES runs in the two emissions scenarios. The possible consequences of regional climate change on vegetation properties, such as biomass, net primary production and changes in forest extent and distribution, were investigated. The Inland model projections show reductions in tropical forest cover in both scenarios. The reduction of tropical forest cover is greater in RCP8.5. The Inland model projects biomass increases where tropical forest remains due to the CO2 fertilization effect. The future distribution of predominant vegetation shows that some areas of tropical rainforest in Central America are replaced by savannah and grassland in RCP4.5. Inland projections under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 show a net primary productivity reduction trend due to significant tropical forest reduction, temperature increase, precipitation reduction and dry spell increments, despite the biomass increases in some areas of Costa Rica and Panama. This study may provide guidance to adaptation studies of climate change impacts on the tropical rainforests in Central America.'

Abstract: 'Determining the capacity of small forest remnants to support biodiversity is of critical importance, especially in the tropics where high rates of land conversion coincide with extraordinarily high species richness and endemism. Using fruit-baited traps, we conducted rapid evaluations in 1993 and 1994 of the forest butterfly diversity of seven small patches (3\xe2\x80\x9330 ha) and a single remaining large patch (227 ha) of Costa Rican mid-elevation moist forest. Our results suggest that even recently isolated 20\xe2\x80\x9330 ha fragments of primary forest retain surprisingly depauperate butterfly faunas relative to that supported by the 227 ha patch only 0.5\xe2\x80\x931.0 km away. If forest butterflies are an index of the diversity of small-bodied organisms in general, preservation of the latter may require unexpectedly large patches. In 1994 we also surveyed a 16 ha botanical garden, situated between and contiguous to both the 227 ha patch and an exceptionally species-rich 25 ha patch. In the garden, we discovered adults of many butterfly species associated with forest interior, suggesting that even heavily managed systems of largely exotic plants (such as agricultural systems) could be designed to serve as corridors for butterflies and perhaps some other groups of organisms. We discuss some implications for a planned restoration of biotic connections between lowland and montane forests in southern Costa Rica.'

Abstract: 'Predicting future changes in tropical rainforest tree communities requires a good understanding of past changes as well as a knowledge of the physiology, ecology and population biology of extant species. Climate change during the next hundred years will be more similar to climate fluctuations that have occurred in the last few thousand years and of a much smaller magnitude than the extent of climate change experienced during last glaciation or at the Pleistocene\xe2\x80\x93Holocene transition. Unfortunately, the extent to which tropical rainforest tree communities have changed during the last few thousand years has been little investigated. As a consequence we lack the detailed evidence for population and range shifts of individual tropical species resulting from climate change analogous to the evidence available for temperate zone forests. Some evidence suggests that the rate of tropical forest change in the last several thousand years may have been high. If so, then CO2 increases and the likely alterations in temperature, forest turnover rate, rainfall, or severe droughts may drive substantial future forest change. How can we predict or model the effects of climate change on a highly diverse tree community? Explanations for the regulation of tropical tree populations often invoke tree physiology or processes that are subject to physiological regulation such as herbivory, pathology or seed production. In order to incorporate such considerations into climate change models, the physiology of a very diverse tree community must be understood. My work has focused on simplifying this diversity by categorizing the shade-tolerant species into functional physiological groups. Most species and most individual trees are shade-tolerant species, gap-requiring species being relatively uncommon. Additionally, in a regenerating gap most of the individuals are shade-tolerant species that established before gap formation. Despite the fact that the shade-tolerant species are of major ecological importance, their comparative physiology has received little attention. I have found that shade-tolerant species differ substantially in their responses to light flecks, treefall light gaps and drought. Furthermore, among phylogenetically unrelated species, these differences in physiology can be predicted from leaf lifetime. These results provide a general framework for understanding the mechanics of tropical rainforests from a physiological perspective that can be used to model their responses to climate change.'

Abstract: 'It has been suggested that soil nitrification is inhibited as a succession develops. This hypothesis was examined in a sub tropical rain forest succession containing five successional stages. Soil mineral nitrogen was measured at the time of collection and after 20 days incubation in the laboratory or field. Sampling was carried out during the wet season and dry season. There was little difference in the ammonium nitrogen concentration at the various sites but increasing amounts of nitrate nitrogen were generally found in each older successional stage.'

Abstract: 'The inter ac tion of land use and sea sonal mi cro cli mat ic events could explain the dif fer ences in soil qual ity char ac ter is tics which medi ate bio log i cal and phys i cal pro cesses of the soil under low input land use sys tems (plough plus har row, strip/heap till age, man ual clear ing/no till). It is hy poth es ised that in a humid trop i cal Alf isol, low input sys tem involv ing reduced till age meth ods, and min eral fer til izer and/or live stock manure use, would sup port a higher den sity of micro bial bio mass, soil aggre ga tion, organic C and total N and hence improve ment in soil qual ity. The dynam ics of biotic and abi otic soil prop er ties as affected by meth ods of seed bed prep a ra tion char ac ter ised by man ur al input and mi cro cli mat ic tran si tions from wet to dry sea son was stud ied in a maize field in a trop i cal rain for est Alf isol in Ak ure, a humid rain for est zone of Nige ria. Each year, tri als were car ried out dur ing the rainy (April\xe2\x80\x93July) and late (September\xe2\x80\x93December) sea sons of 2001 and 2002. Meth ods of seed bed prep a ra tion involv ing plough plus har row, strip/heap till age and no till age, and addi tion of dif fer ent gra di ents of manures (mineral N and/or plant debris and live stock litter) were imposed on the soil at the site of the exper i ment (of com pa ra ble phys i cal prop er ties of bulk den sity and texture). Among the treat ments, there were sig nif i cant dif fer ences in the val ues of water hold ing capac ity, aggre gate sta bil ity (macro-aggre ga tion), con cen tra tions of micro bial bio mass, organic C, total and min eral N and CEC. In the rainy and late sea son tri als, the strip/heap till age and the no till treat ments improved aggre gate sta bil ity (as mea sured by the per cent ages of aggre gates between 2 and 10\xc2\xa0mm of soil) and water hold ing capac ity over plough\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0har row. For exam ple, in the rainy sea son trial, under treat ments involv ing strip/heap till age and the no till alone and in com bi na tion with live stock manur ing and res i due reten tion, the val ues of aggre gates between 2 and 10\xc2\xa0mm range from (110\xe2\x80\x93116; 113\xe2\x80\x93119\xc2\xa0g/kg) and water hold ing capac ity (0.11\xe2\x80\x930.14; 0.12\xe2\x80\x930.15\xc2\xa0g/g) over plough\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0har row (107.3\xc2\xa0g/kg; 0.11\xc2\xa0g/g). Sim i lar trends were found in the val ues of soil micro bial bio mass C (377, 353; 547, 490\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g dry soil), soil organic C (3.8, 4.3; 5.2,5.5\xc2\xa0g/g) and total N (2.9, 2.3; 2.9, 3.0\xc2\xa0mg/g) for strip/heap and no till treat ments com pared to plough\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0har row (327.6\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g dry soil; 3.4\xc2\xa0g/g; 2.8\xc2\xa0mg/g). Although the %C micro bial to C organic ratio (an indicator of the utilisation of organic carbon by the microbes in terms of organic matter turn over rate) was sta ble for all treatments, its magnitude was not con stant but increased with increases in soil C concentration. The values of microbial bio mass carbon to organic carbon (Cmic: Corg) ratio were higher under plough ing and heap till age com bined with min eral N (0.096, 0.099) than in no-till treat ment (0.083) in the rainy sea son trial. Similar trends were obtained in the magnitudes of this param eter in the late sea son trial. Microbial bio mass correlated positively with both soil organic C (y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.393c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa06.7; r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.99; P<\xc2\xa00.05) and water hold ing capacity (y = 0.87c0.39; r2 = 0.94; P<0.05) and neg a tively with bulk density (y=\xe2\x88\x920.3c+1.9; r2 = 0.90; P<0.05), strong positive lin ear cor re la tion were also found between soil macro aggre gates and other soil prop er ties: micro bial bio mass C (y=0.41c\xe2\x88\x9218.4; r2=0.95; P<0.05), organic C (y=0.61c\xe2\x88\x9214.3; r2 = 0.97; P<0.05) and total N (y = 0.063c\xe2\x88\x9210.8; r2 = 0.98; P<0.05). Huge responses of soil characteristics were obtained from low input land use systems (plough plus har row, strip/heap till age, manual clear ing/no till). These proper ties mediate many biological and physical processes of soil carbon, N mineralisation, soil aggregation and water hold ing capacity and microbial bio mass, and led to improvement in soil quality. The emerged trend was that the interaction of land use, clay content of the soil and seasonal micro climatic events could explain the heteroge neity of soil components among treatments.'

Abstract: 'Airborne measurements of acetone were performed overthe tropical rainforest in Surinam(2\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xb0 N, 54\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x9358\xc2\xb0 W, 0\xe2\x80\x9312 kmaltitude) during the LBA-CLAIRE campaign in March1998, using a novel proton transfer reaction massspectrometer (PTR-MS) that enables the on-linemonitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOC) with ahigher proton affinity than water. The measuredacetone volume mixing ratios ranged from \xe2\x88\xbc0.1 nmol/molup to \xe2\x88\xbc8 nmol/mol with an overall average of 2.6nmol/mol and a standard deviation of 1.0 nmol/mol. Theobserved altitude profile and correlations with CO,acetonitrile, propane and wind direction are discussedwith respect to potential acetone sources. No linearcorrelation between acetone and CO mixing ratios wasobserved, at variance with results of previousmeasurement campaigns. The mean acetone/CO ratio(0.022) was substantially higher than typical valuesfound before. The abundance of acetone appears to beinfluenced, but not dominated, by biomass burning,thus suggesting large emissions of acetone and/oracetone precursors, such as possibly 2-propanol, fromliving plants or decaying litter in the rainforest.'

Abstract: 'In order to understand how the seed rain differs among Amazonian forests, I sampled the seed rain in six different forest types across the Amazonian landscape.'

Abstract: 'We summarize work on a speciose Neotropical tree genus, Inga (Fabaceae), examining how interspecific variation in anti-herbivore defenses may have evolved, how defenses shape host choice by herbivores and how they might regulate community composition and influence species radiations. Defenses of expanding leaves include secondary metabolites, extrafloral nectaries, rapid leaf expansion, trichomes, and synchrony and timing of leaf production. These six classes of defenses are orthogonal, supporting independent evolutionary trajectories. Moreover, only trichomes show a phylogenetic signature, suggesting evolutionary lability in nearly all defenses. The interspecific diversity in secondary metabolite profiles does not arise from the evolution of novel compounds, but from novel combinations of common compounds, presumably due to changes in gene regulation. Herbivore host choice is determined by plant defensive traits, not host phylogeny. Neighboring plants escape each other\xe2\x80\x99s pests if their defenses differ enough, thereby enforcing the high local diversity typical of tropical forests. Related herbivores feed on hosts with similar defenses, implying that there are phylogenetic constraints placed on the herbivore traits that are associated with host use. Divergence in defensive traits among Inga appears to be driven by herbivore pressure. However, the lack of congruence between herbivore and host phylogeny suggests that herbivores are tracking defenses, choosing hosts based on traits for which they already have adaptations. There is, therefore, an asymmetry in the host\xe2\x80\x93herbivore evolutionary arms race.'

Abstract: 'The remote Tiputini-Yasuni tropical forest region of the northwest Amazon (eastern Ecuador) represents a rich biodiversity likely unsurpassed anywhere else on earth. The myriad ecosystems, habitats and organisms are embedded in layers of symbiotic expressions. This region and particularly its Tiputini Biodiversity Station operated by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito offer unique and significant opportunities for symbiosis research and needed habitat conservation support. The centrality of symbioses in tropical rainforests is discussed through a review of selected literature and based on recent first-hand field experiences.'

Abstract: 'Losses of nitrogen (N) often follow severe disturbance of forest ecosystems. In tropical forests, losses of N associated with the disturbance of clearing may be particularly important because rates of soil N cycling are high and forest clearing now occurs on a large scale. We measured soil solution inorganic N concentrations and fluxes for 1 year in an intact forest in the Brazilian Amazon state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia and in an adjacent 3-ha forest plot that was cleared for pasture by cutting, burning and planting pasture grass and in established cattle pastures on the same soils that were 5 and 22\xc2\xa0years old. The cleared forest had higher soil solution NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  concentrations than the intact forest, but the difference between the cleared and control forests declined with time after the start of the first post-clearing rainy season. Established pastures had much lower solution NH 4 +  and NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  concentrations than forest or cleared forest. Estimated annual dissolved inorganic solution N fluxes to below 1\xc2\xa0m during the first year after clearing were 2.5\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in forest and 24.4\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in newly cleared forest compared with only 0.5\xe2\x80\x931.2\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in established pastures. The solution fluxes from cleared forest during the first year after clearing were approximately 7 times greater than gaseous N oxide (N2O+NO) losses estimated for the same time. These results were consistent with the characterization of moist tropical forests on weathered soils as N-rich and likely to respond to disturbances that elevate soil N availability with increased loss to both soil solution and the atmosphere. These results also suggest that the relative increase in N oxide loss is substantially less than the increase solution inorganic N loss.'

Abstract: ' Previous studies of the effect of tropical forest conversion to cattle pasture on soil N dynamics showed that rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification were lower in pastures compared with the original forest. In this study, we sought to determine the generality of these patterns by examining soil inorganic N concentrations, net mineralization and nitrification rates in 6 forests and 11 pastures 3 years old or older on ultisols and oxisols that encompassed a wide variety of soil textures and spanned a 700-km geographical range in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon Basin state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia. We sampled each site during October-November and April-May. Forest soils had higher extractable NO3\xe2\x88\x92-N and total inorganic N concentrations than pasture soils, but substantial NO3\xe2\x88\x92-N occurred in both forest and pasture soils. Rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification were higher in forest soils. Greater concentrations of soil organic matter in finer textured soils were associated with greater rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification, but this relationship was true only under native forest vegetation; rates were uniformly low in pastures, regardless of soil type or texture. Net N mineralization and net nitrification rates per unit of total soil organic matter showed no pattern across the different forest sites, suggesting that controls of net N mineralization may be broadly similar across a wide range of soil types. Similar reductions in rates of net N transformations in pastures 3 years old or older across a range of textures on these soils suggest that changes to soil N cycling caused by deforestation for pasture may be Basin-wide in extent. Lower net N mineralization and net nitrification rates in established pastures suggest that annual N losses from largely deforested landscapes may be lower than losses from the original forest. Total ecosystem N losses since deforestation are likely to depend on the balance between lower N loss rates from established pastures and the magnitude and duration of N losses that occur in the years immediately following forest clearing.'

Abstract: 'In this paper, we draw upon Goffman\xe2\x80\x99s symbolic interactionism to analyze the ways in which\xc2\xa0new users in developing countries have adopted ICT to present and manage contradictory self-images to different groups of the public. In particular, we show that the Acap\xc3\xba, an indigenous group in the Amazon, present themselves through online videos and websites as ideal Indians: innate forest stewards aiming to mitigate climate change and ensure the planet\xe2\x80\x99s environmental sustainability. At the same time, the Acap\xc3\xba are also represented through a complex computer simulation\xc2\xa0model as destructive \xe2\x80\x9ccowboys\xe2\x80\x9d: farmers and ranchers who are willing to develop by clearing their forests in the absence of financial compensation. This research shows that these two opposing self-images, while contradictory, are necessary for the implementation of REDD projects (a payment mechanism for reducing greenhouse emissions from deforestation). In order to obtain carbon credits from avoided deforestation, the project relies on the difference between deforestation measurements and high levels of predicted deforestation, which in turn, depend on the presentation of destructive self-images through the use of a\xc2\xa0complex computer simulation. But to sell these credits on a voluntary carbon market, it is necessary for the Acap\xc3\xba to openly market a self-image through the Internet which is attractive to corporate buyers willing to boost their eco-friendly profile. Based on this analysis, the paper challenges the narrative whereby Southern ICT users are passive receivers of technological black boxes. In contrast, it shows that in some cases these new users may participate in the creation of ICT artifacts to manage the impressions of distant audiences. Furthermore, the paper calls attention to the role of computer simulations and other ICT applications in concealing the paradoxes of neoliberal environmental management practices.'

Abstract: 'Land-use systems (LUS), placed in originally forested areas, represent different degrees of opportunity for species conservation. In this study, we examined the dung beetle communities in order to identify the conservation value of different LUS: primary forest, old secondary forest, young secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture and pasture in Western Amazon. The LUS were sampled in two campaigns during the highest precipitation period and dryest period. The primary forest has a high number of total and exclusive species. Large beetles show a continuous decreasing in richness and abundance from primary forest to pastures, while small ones are not sensible to intermediate systems (secondary forest to agriculture) in terms of species richness and exhibit a increase in abundance at agroforest and agriculture when contrasted to secondary forest and pasture The beetle community composition was not sensible to secondary forest recovering time. Secondary forests and agroforestry stood out as harboring many species shared with primary forests. Cloud-point dispersion (average dissimilarity) increased from primary forest towards LUS\xe2\x80\x99s submitted to more intense use. The higher sampling points similarity observed in primary forest might be the result of the relative stability of this system, given that environmental impacts might increase variability in community structure and beta diversity. Increase in beta diversity as expressed by greater dispersion of sites in multivariate space suggests that these areas are dependent on nearby species pools, possibly primary forests, and harbor a higher spatial heterogeneity in species composition. This high variability can overestimate the importance of occasional species, thus biasing the actual value of alternative LUS for biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'Many indigenous villages in the Amazon basin still suffer from a high malaria burden. Despite this health situation, there are few studies on the bionomics of anopheline larvae in such areas. This publication aims to identify the main larval habitats of the most abundant anopheline species and to assess their associations with some environmental factors.'

Abstract: 'Energy balance closure is the main indicator of the quality of energy flux measurements obtained by the eddy covariance technique. Many researchers use a simple linear regression model between energy balance components to evaluate closure. However, these studies typically fail to verify the appropriateness of the statistical assumptions of regression analysis, which can lead to erroneous conclusions if the model is not satisfactory. Thus, the aim of this study was to calibrate and validate simple and robust with bootstrap and cross-validation linear regression models to verify the efficiency of energy balance closure in the Amazon ecosystem. Measurements of net radiation and latent, sensible, and ground heat fluxes were made from January to December 2008 in a tropical rain forest area in South West Amazonia in an experimental site belonging to the network of flux towers of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). The results demonstrated that simple linear regression models are not appropriate for analyzing energy balance closure. However, robust linear regression models with bootstrap and cross-validation improved the fit to the data. Despite the better fit, there was an increase in energy balance closure residuals suggesting that the eddy covariance technique is underestimating the values of energy fluxes in Amazon forest areas more than what were reported in previous researches.'

Abstract: 'Hydrochemical changes caused by slash-and-burnagricultural practices in a small upland catchment inthe central Amazon were measured. Soluteconcentrations were analyzed in wet deposition,overland flow, shallow throughflow, groundwater andbank seepage in a forested plot (about 5 ha) and anadjacent plot (about 2 ha) which had been deforestedin July 1989 and planted to manioc, and in streamwater in partially deforested and forested catchments. Measurements were made from November 1988 to June1990. The effects of slash-and-burn agriculturalpractices observed in the experimental plot includedincreased overland flow, erosion, and large losses ofsolutes from the rooted zone. Concentrations ofNO3-, Na+, K+, SO42-,Cl- and Mn in throughflow of the experimentalplot were higher than those of the control plot bymore than a factor of 10. Extensive leaching occurredafter cutting and burning, but solute transfers werediminished along pathway stages of throughflow togroundwater, and particularly within the riparian zoneof the catchment. High concentrations of N and P inoverland flow indicate the importance of usingforested riparian buffers to mitigate solute inputs toreceiving waters in tropical catchments.'

Abstract: 'Questions concerning the availability of resources in tropical rain forests have given rise to the current debate centering on whether human subsistence based solely on foraging is possible in these biomes without agricultural subsidies. This paper takes the position that changing perspectives on ecological pattern and process in tropical forests and the significant variation among tropical forests on a worldwide as well as regional scale must be taken into consideration. Human disturbance is also proposed as a cause of dependence on agriculture by modern human foragers rather than as a necessary precondition for successful exploitation of the tropical forest. These issues are discussed against the background of a case study of the Yuqu\xc3\xad, who, until very recently, were true foragers in the Bolivian Amazon. For the Yuqu\xc3\xad, the sustainability of their subsistence system depended on a finegrained knowledge of their environment and the freedom of movement over a large territory to access resources within it.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was less than 1% before 1975. Between 1975 and 1987 the rate increased exponentially. By 1985, world opinion and attention to the destruction of the richest biome on earth led to elimination of some of the major incentives that had fueled deforestation. Favorable credit policies for cattle ranchers, rather than population growth, explains the process of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The paper suggests other actions that may be taken to reduce deforestation, and examines the rapid growth rates of secondary successional species in a colonization area.'

Abstract: 'The paper initially outlines selected uncertainties influencing climate change and their linkages with hydrology which have led to only a small section of the hydrological community (divided into 2 groups) being pro-active. Due to the foregoing uncertainties, the strategy adopted in this paper will be to focus on the principal conclusions from controlled experimental catchment studies and related process hydrology connected with land-use change arising from anthropogenic influences. The underlying philosophy is that even major natural disruptions to climate cause ecohydrological shifts in the response of landscapes and such changes may be indicated from recent hydrology research evaluating man-made impacts. The paper assesses the existing conclusions from hydrological work undertaken in both the closed forests of the humid tropics and the open forests of the tropical semi-arid regions based mostly from experimentation in headwater catchments. Such studies are concerned with the hydrological responses to the impacts of forest conversion on the change in total water yield and, in turn, the processes connected with dry weather flow (delayed flow) and storm runoff (quickflow). By taking the above approach, possible hydrological changes to climate change will be inferred, including some consideration given the outputs from atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs) using the Amazon basin as an example.'

Abstract: 'To advance our understanding of the processes that govern the assembly of palm communities and the local coexistence of numerous palm species, we here synthesize available information in the literature on species diversity and growth-form composition in palm communities across the Americas. American palm communities surveyed had 4\xe2\x80\x9348 (median 16) species in study plots covering 0.09\xe2\x80\x937.2\xc2\xa0ha. Climate, soils, hydrology, and topography are the main factors determining palm community species richness. Tropical lowland terra firme rain forests are the most species-rich whereas forests that are inundated or grow on sandy soils or in areas with seasonal climate have much fewer species. Palm communities in the central-western Amazon and in Central America are significantly richer than the average region and those in the Caribbean significantly poorer in species. As for branching, the 789 species of tropical American palms belong to Corner\xe2\x80\x99s model (solitary, 268 species, 33%), Tomlinsons model (cespitose, 521 species, 66%) and Schoute\xe2\x80\x99s model (dichotomous branching, three species, <1%). We assigned the species to eight different growth forms: (i) Large tall-stemmed Palms (102 spp), (ii) Large-leaved medium\xe2\x80\x93short-stemmed Palms (31 spp), (iii) Medium-sized Palms (95 spp), (iv) Medium/Small Palms with Stout Stem (42 spp), (v) Small Palms (423 spp), (vi) Large acaulescent Palms (28 spp), (vii) Small acaulescent Palms (56 spp), and (viii) Climbing Palms (12 spp). The eight growth forms are differently represented in the palm communities, and the categories Small Palms and Large tall-stemmed Palms dominate the communities both in terms of species richness and in number of individuals.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon Basin harbors one of the richest biotas on Earth, such that a number of diversification hypotheses have been formulated to explain patterns of Amazonian biodiversity and biogeography. For nearly two decades, phylogeographic approaches have been applied to better understand the underlying causes of genetic differentiation and geographic structure among Amazonian organisms. Although this research program has made progress in elucidating several aspects of species diversification in the region, recent methodological and theoretical developments in the discipline of phylogeography will provide new perspectives through more robust hypothesis testing. Herein, we outline central aspects of Amazonian geology and landscape evolution as well as climate and vegetation dynamics through the Neogene and Quaternary to contextualize the historical settings considered by major hypotheses of diversification. We address each of these hypotheses by reviewing key phylogeographic papers and by expanding their respective predictions. We also propose future directions for devising and testing hypotheses. Specifically, combining the exploratory power of phylogeography with the statistical rigor of coalescent methods will greatly expand analytical inferences on the evolutionary history of Amazonian biota. Incorporation of non-genetic data from Earth science disciplines into the phylogeographic approach is key to a better understanding of the influence of climatic and geophysical events on patterns of Amazonian biodiversity and biogeography. In addition, achieving such an integrative enterprise must involve overcoming issues such as limited geographic and taxonomic sampling. These future challenges likely will be accomplished by a combination of extensive collaborative research and incentives for conducting basic inventories.'

Abstract: 'This study provides an updated analysis of the evolution of seasonal rainfall intensity in the Amazon basin, considering the 1981\xe2\x80\x932017 period and based on HOP (interpolated HYBAM observed precipitation) and CHIRPS (The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations) rainfall data sets. Dry and wet day frequencies as well as extreme percentiles are used in this analysis, producing the same results. Dry-day frequency (DDF) significantly increases in the Southern Amazon (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01), particularly during September\xe2\x80\x93November (SON) in the Bolivian Amazon, central Peruvian Amazon and far southern Brazilian Amazon. Consistently, total rainfall in the southern Amazon during SON also shows a significant diminution (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05), estimated at 18%. The increase in SON DDF in the southern Amazon is related to a warming of the northern tropical Atlantic Ocean and a weakening of water vapour flux from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The increase in DDF in the southern Amazon is related to enhanced wind subsidence (ascendance) over the 10\xc2\xb0S\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xb0S (5\xc2\xb0S\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xb0N) region and to a deficit (excess) of specific humidity at 1000\xe2\x80\x93300\xc2\xa0hPa south of 10\xc2\xb0S (north of the 5\xc2\xb0S), which suggest a reduction of deep convection over southern Amazonia. Subsidence over the southern Amazon shows a significant trend (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01), which can explain the significant increase in DDF. Wet-day frequency (WDF) significantly increases in the northern Amazon, particularly during the March\xe2\x80\x93May (MAM) period (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01), producing an estimated rainfall increase during MAM of 17% (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01) between 1981 and 2017. Significant changes in both WDF and rainfall in northern Amazon have been detected in 1998 (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01). After 1998, the increase in MAM WDF and rainfall is explained by enhanced moisture flux from the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and an increase in deep convection over the northern and northwestern Amazon. These evolutions in DDF and WDF and in the tropical atmosphere occur simultaneously with an increase in sea surface temperature in the northern Atlantic Ocean, particularly after the mid-1990s. These results provide new insight into rainfall variability and climatic features related to increasing dry season length in southern Amazonia. Severe recent droughts may be associated with the increase in DDF in the South. In addition, the increase in MAM rainfall intensity in northern Amazon after 1998 may be associated with several historical floods that occurred after this date.'

Abstract: 'Resource exploitation in lowland tropical forests is increasingand causing loss of biodiversity. Effective evaluation and management of the impacts of development on tropical forests requires appropriate assessment and monitoring tools. We proposethe use of 0.1-ha multi-scale, modified Whittaker plots (MWPs) to assess and monitor vegetation in lowland tropical rainforests.We established MWPs at 4 sites to: (1) describe and comparecomposition and structure of the sites using MWPs, (2) compare these results to those of 1-ha permanent vegetation plots (BDPs),and (3) evaluate the ability of MWPs to detect changes in populations (statistical power). We recorded more than 400 species at each site. Species composition among the sites was distinctive, while mean abundance and basal area was similar. Comparisons between MWPs and BDPs show that they record similarspecies composition and abundance and that both perform equallywell at detecting rare species. However, MWPs tend to record morespecies, and power analysis studies show that MWPs were more effective at detecting changes in the mean number of species of trees \xe2\x89\xa510 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) and in herbaceous plants. Ten MWPs were sufficient to detect a change of 11% in the mean number of herb species, and they were able to detect a 14% change in the mean number of species of trees \xe2\x89\xa510 cm dbh. The value of MWPs for assessment and monitoringis discussed, along with recommendations for improving the sampling design to increase power.'

Abstract: 'The interspecific variability of sunlit leaf carbon isotope composition (\xce\xb413C), an indicator of leaf intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE, CO2 assimilation rate/leaf conductance for water vapour), was investigated in canopy trees of three lowland rainforest stands in French Guiana, differing in floristic composition and in soil drainage characteristics, but subjected to similar climatic conditions. We sampled leaves with a rifle from 406 trees in total, representing 102 species. Eighteen species were common to the three stands. Mean species \xce\xb413C varied over a 6.0\xe2\x80\xb0 range within each stand, corresponding to WUE varying over about a threefold range. Species occurring in at least two stands displayed remarkably stable \xce\xb413C values, suggesting a close genetic control of species \xce\xb413C. Marked differences in species \xce\xb413C values were found with respect to: (1) the leaf phenology pattern (average \xce\xb413C=\xe2\x80\x9329.7\xe2\x80\xb0 and \xe2\x80\x9331.0\xe2\x80\xb0 in deciduous-leaved and evergreen-leaved species, respectively), and (2) different types of shade tolerance defined by features reflecting the plasticity of growth dynamics with respect to contrasting light conditions. Heliophilic species exhibited more negative \xce\xb413C values (average \xce\xb413C=\xe2\x80\x9330.5\xe2\x80\xb0) (i.e. lower WUE) than hemitolerant species (\xe2\x80\x9329.3\xe2\x80\xb0). However, tolerant species (\xe2\x80\x9331.4\xe2\x80\xb0) displayed even more negative \xce\xb413C values than heliophilic ones. We could not provide a straightforward ecophysiological interpretation of this result. The negative relationship found between species \xce\xb413C and midday leaf water potential (\xce\xa8wm) suggests that low \xce\xb413C is associated with high whole tree leaf specific hydraulic conductance. Canopy carbon isotope discrimination (\xce\x94 A ) calculated from the basal area-weighed integral of the species \xce\xb413C values was similar in the three stands (average \xce\x94 A =23.1\xe2\x80\xb0), despite differences in stand species composition and soil drainage type, reflecting the similar proportions of the three different shade-tolerance types among stands.'

Abstract: 'A time-series analysis of airborne photographs and Landsat thematic mapper (TM and ETM+) images and hydrochemical data were used to examine the effects of land-use change from 1930 to 2001 on solute inputs to Lake Calado, a floodplain lake in the central Amazon. Deforestation from slash-and-burn agricultural activities has dramatically decreased the amount of primary growth upland and flooded forests in the basin. The increasing area that is converted to agricultural plots and pasture in the Lake Calado basin has increased solute loading to the lake from upland tributaries (storm and base flow), bank seepage and overland flow, and decreased throughfall inputs. Whereas solute concentrations in stream water were generally higher in 1992 than 1930, Na+ and Cl\xe2\x88\x92 concentrations were also considerably higher in 2001 than 1992, likely because of an increase in the number of humans and cattle in the watershed. Estimates of solute inputs to Lake Calado via throughfall indicate that the mass transfer of some major solutes in the throughfall of undisturbed flooded forests can be larger than that from a combination of all other sources in areas that do not have a strong influence from the Solim\xc3\xb5es River. Chemical gains in rain as it passed through the forest canopy occurred for most major ions and relatively large gains were observed for \\({\\text{PO}}_{\\text{4}}^{3--} \\) and Ca2+. Although often neglected in studies of tropical forest ecosystems, throughfall can be an important source of solutes to relatively undisturbed lake environments in the central Amazon.'

Abstract: 'This study reports the first assessment of the compounding effects of land-use change and greenhouse gas warming effects on our understanding of projections of future climate. An AGCM simulation of the potential impacts of tropical deforestation and greenhouse warming on climate, employing a version of NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM1-Oz), is presented. The joint impacts of tropical deforestation and greenhouse warming are assessed by an experiment in which removal of tropical rainforests is imposed into a greenhouse-warmed climate. Results show that the joint climate changes over tropical rainforest regions comprise large reductions in surface evapotranspiration (by about \xe2\x88\x92180 mm yr\xe2\x88\x921) andprecipitation (by about \xe2\x88\x92312 mm yr\xe2\x88\x921) over the Amazon Basin, along with anincrease of surface temperature by +3.0 K. Over Southeast Asia, similar but weaker changes are found in this study. Precipitation is decreased by \xe2\x88\x92172 mmyr\xe2\x88\x921, together with the surface warming of 2.1 K. Over tropical Africa, changes in regional climate is much weaker and with some different features, such as the increase of precipitation by 25 mm yr\xe2\x88\x921. Energy budgetanalyses demonstrates that the large increase of surface temperature in the joint experiment is not solely produced by the increase of CO2concentration, but is a joint effect of the reduction of surface evaporation (due to deforestation) and the increase of downward atmospheric longwave radiation (due to the doubling of CO2 concentration). Furthermore, impactsof tropical deforestation on the greenhouse-warmed climate are estimated by comparing a pair of tropical deforestation simulations. It is found that in CCM1-Oz, deforestation has very similar impacts on greenhouse-warmed regional climates as on current climates over tropical rainforest regions. The extra-tropical climatic response to tropical deforestation is identified in both sets of tropical deforestation experiments. Statistically significant responses are seen in the large-scale atmospheric circulation such as changes in the velocity potential and vertically integrated kinetic and potential energy fields. Wave propagation patterns are identified in the large-scale circulation anomalies, which provides a mechanism for interpreting the model responses in the extra-tropics. In addition, this study suggests that land-use change such as tropical deforestation may affect projections of future climate.'

Abstract: 'In Amazonian non-flooded forests with a moderate dry season, many trees do not form anatomically definite annual rings. Alternative indicators of annual rings, such as the oxygen (\xce\xb418Owc) and carbon stable isotope ratios of wood cellulose (\xce\xb413Cwc), have been proposed; however, their applicability in Amazonian forests remains unclear. We examined seasonal variations in the \xce\xb418Owc and \xce\xb413Cwc of three common species (Eschweilera coriacea, Iryanthera coriacea, and Protium hebetatum) in Manaus, Brazil (Central Amazon). E. coriacea was also sampled in two other regions to determine the synchronicity of the isotopic signals among different regions. The annual cyclicity of \xce\xb418Owc variation was cross-checked by 14C dating. The \xce\xb418Owc showed distinct seasonal variations that matched the amplitude observed in the \xce\xb418O of precipitation, whereas seasonal \xce\xb413Cwc variations were less distinct in most cases. The \xce\xb418Owc variation patterns were similar within and between some individual trees in Manaus. However, the \xce\xb418Owc patterns of E. coriacea differed by region. The ages of some samples estimated from the \xce\xb418Owc cycles were offset from the ages estimated by 14C dating. In the case of E. coriacea, this phenomenon suggested that missing or wedging rings may occur frequently even in well-grown individuals. Successful cross-dating may be facilitated by establishing \xce\xb418Owc master chronologies at both seasonal and inter-annual scales for tree species with distinct annual rings in each region.'

Abstract: 'We examined the natural abundance of 15N in soil profiles along two chronosequences in the western Brazilian Amazon Basin state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia, to investigate possible mechanisms for changes to soil nitrogen sources and transformations that occur as a result of land use. One chronosequence consisted of forest and 3-, 5- and 20-year-old pasture, the other of forest and 8- and 20-year-old pasture. The \xce\xb415N values of surface soil and soil to 1 m depth in the native forest ranged from 9.8 to 13.6\xe2\x80\xb0 and were higher than reported for temperate forest soils. Fractionation associated with nitrification and denitrification and selective losses of 15N-depleted nitrate, could potentially result in a strong enrichment of nitrogen in soil organic matter over the time scale of soil development in highly weathered tropical soils. Pasture surface soils were 1\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\xb0, depleted in 15N compared with forest soils. Lower \xce\xb415N values in 20-year-old pastures is consistent with greater cumulative inputs of 15N-depleted atmospheric-derived nitrogen, fixed by free-living bacteria associated with planted pasture grasses in older pastures, or differential plant utilization of soil inorganic N pools with different \xce\xb415N values. The pattern of \xce\xb415N values following conversion of forest to agricultural use differs from the pattern in the temperate zone, where pasture or cultivated soils are typically more enriched in 15N than the forest soils from which they were derived.'

Abstract: 'To begin exploring the underlying mechanisms that couple vegetation to cloud formation processes, we derive the lifting condensation level (LCL) to estimate cumulus cloud base height. Using a fully coupled land\xe2\x80\x93ocean\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere general circulation model (HadCM3LC), we investigate Amazonian forest feedbacks on cloud formation over three geological periods; modern-day (a.d. 1970\xe2\x80\x931990), the last glacial maximum (LGM; 21\xc2\xa0kya), and under a future climate scenario (IS92a; a.d. 2070\xe2\x80\x932090). Results indicate that for both past and future climate scenarios, LCL is higher relative to modern-day. Statistical analyses indicate that the 800\xc2\xa0m increase in LCL during the LGM is related primarily to the drier atmosphere promoted by lower tropical sea surface temperatures. In contrast, the predicted 1,000\xc2\xa0m increase in LCL in the future scenario is the result of a large increase in surface temperature and reduced vegetation cover.'

Abstract: 'Wetland extent, vegetation cover, and inundation state were mapped for the first time at moderately high (100\xc2\xa0m) resolution for the entire lowland Amazon basin, using mosaics of Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) imagery acquired during low- and high-water seasons in 1995\xe2\x80\x931996. A wetlands mask was created by segmentation of the mosaics and clustering of the resulting polygons; a rules set was then applied to classify wetland areas into five land cover classes and two flooding classes using dual-season backscattering values. The mapped wetland area of 8.4\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105\xc2\xa0km2 is equivalent to 14\xc2\xa0% of the total basin area (5.83\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89106\xc2\xa0km2) and 17\xc2\xa0% of the lowland basin (5.06\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89106\xc2\xa0km2). During high-water season, open water surfaces accounted for 9\xc2\xa0% of the wetland area, woody vegetation 77\xc2\xa0%, and aquatic macrophytes 14\xc2\xa0%. Producer\xe2\x80\x99s accuracy as assessed using high-resolution digital videography was better than 85\xc2\xa0% for wetland extent. The mapped flooding extent is representative of average high- and low-flood conditions for latitudes north of 6\xc2\xb0 S; flooding conditions were less well captured for the southern part of the basin. Global data sets derived from lower-resolution optical sensors capture less than 25\xc2\xa0% of the wetland area mapped here.'

Abstract: 'Belowground processes in light gap openings are poorly understood, particularly in tropical forests. Fine roots in three zones of light gap openings and adjacent intact forest were regularly measured in buried bags and surface litter envelopes for 2 years. Fine root biomass does not vary significantly within gaps for either buried bags or for surface litter envelopes. When entire gaps are compared without regard for within gap zones, root growth into both surface litter and buried bags is significantly different between gaps, with highest rates of fine root biomass accumulation in the smallest gap. These results suggest that the aboveground within-gap zones do not result in a congruent pattern of below-ground zonation. Gap size, decomposition of the fallen tree, and pre-gap fine root growth rates should be considered to determine fine root growth patterns following the formation of light gap openings.'

Abstract: 'The aim of the study was to report tick infestations on wild birds in a region of the eastern Brazilian Amazon and evaluate the rickettsial infection of these ticks. Wild birds captured by mist nets were examined for the presence of ticks, which were collected and identified to species by morphology or molecular methods. In addition, part of these ticks was individually tested by polymerase chain reaction targeting portions of the rickettsial genes gltA and ompA. Among 331 captured birds, representing 56 species, 133 individuals (40.2%) from 34 species were found infested by 443 ticks, being Amblyomma longirostre (Koch) the most common (103 larvae, 12 nymphs), followed by Amblyomma humerale Koch (15 larvae, 3 nymphs), Amblyomma geayi Neumann (seven larvae, one nymph), Amblyomma calcaratum Neumann (one larva, four nymphs), Amblyomma coelebs Neumann (two larvae), and Haemaphysalis juxtakochi Cooley (one larva, two nymphs). Other 285 larvae and 7 nymphs collected from birds could not be identified to species and were morphologically identified as Amblyomma spp. The species A. humerale and A. geayi are recorded for first time parasitizing birds in the Neotropical region. Among 67 A. longirostre and 7 A. geayi, 38 (56.7%) and 4 (57.1%), respectively, were found infected by Rickettsia amblyommii. In spite of R. amblyommii being not currently recognized as human or animal pathogen, there has been serological evidence for human and canine infection by this agent in the USA and in the Brazilian western Amazon.'

Abstract: 'The preservation of the world\xe2\x80\x99s rain forests is one of the major environmental challenges of our generation. Rain forests are home to a large portion of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity, and play a major role in climate regulation and in the hydrological cycle of the Earth. Despite their biological richness and ecological importance, most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s rain forests are under increasing pressure of deforestation caused by human actions. Deforestation is particularly intense in countries with large-scale agricultural production, such as Brazil and Indonesia. In the Brazilian Amazonia, which covers an area of 4 million km2, 17% of the original forest has been cleared, according to the Brazilian deforestation monitoring system, developed by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Science Magazine called the Brazilian system \xe2\x80\x9cthe envy of the world\xe2\x80\x9d, but warned that, in spite of recent improvements in forest monitoring, uncertainties are still large (Kintisch 2007). Because of data and capacity gaps, current information on global deforestation is extremely patchy. There is much disagreement in the scientific community about the magnitude and extent of deforestation worldwide. As an example, the FAO 2005 Forest Resource Assessment (FAO 2006) points out that deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia from 2001\xe2\x80\x932005 equals 31,000\xc2\xa0km2/yr. Using data imagery from a different satellite, Hansen et al. (2008) estimated that forest clearings for Brazil in the same period were 26,000\xc2\xa0km2/yr. INPE\xc2\xb4s detailed estimates are 22,000\xc2\xa0km2/yr for the same period (Valeriano et al. 2008). If we compare them to INPE\xe2\x80\x99s data, the FAO 2005 report and Hansen et al. overestimated deforestation in Amazonia by 63% and 18% respectively. Furthermore, making such estimates is a large effort, and comprehensive results take long to be obtained and validated. Information science and technology has a key role in the improvement of the monitoring efforts, but the efficient collection, organization, and distribution of large volumes of data still represent a great challenge for it.'

Abstract: 'The natural abundance of 15N was examined in soil profiles from forests and pastures of the Brazilian Amazon Basin to compare tropical forests on a variety of soil types and to investigate changes in the sources of nitrogen to soils following deforestation for cattle ranching. Six sites in the state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia, two sites in Par\xc3\xa1 and one in Amazonas were studied. All sites except one were chronosequences and contained native forest and one or more pastures ranging from 2 to 27 years old. Forest soil \xce\xb415N values to a depth of 1 m ranged from 8\xe2\x80\xb0 to 23\xe2\x80\xb0 and were higher than values typically found in temperate forests. A general pattern of increasing \xce\xb415N values with depth near the soil surface was broadly similar to patterns in other forests but a decrease in \xce\xb415N values in many forest profiles between 20 and 40 cm suggests that illuviation of 15N-depleted nitrate may influence total soil \xce\xb415N values in deeper soil where total N concentrations are low. In four chronosequences in Rond\xc3\xb4nia, the \xce\xb415N values of surface soil from pastures were lower than in the original forest and \xce\xb415N values were increasingly depleted in older pastures. Inputs of atmospheric N by dinitrogen fixation could be an important N source in these pastures. Other pastures in Amazonas and Par\xc3\xa1 and Rond\xc3\xb4nia showed no consistent change from forest values. The extent of fractionation that leads to 15N enrichment in soils was broadly similar over a wide range of soil textures and indicated that similar processes control N fractionation and loss under tropical forest over a broad geographic region. Forest \xce\xb415N profiles were consistent with conceptual models that explain enrichment of soil \xce\xb415N values by selective loss of 14N during nitrification and denitrification.'

Abstract: "The land uses that now predominate in Brazil's Amazon Region are unlikely to produce sustainable yields. They also tend to close off potentially sustainable alternative uses. Cattle pasture \xe2\x80\x94 either productive or abandoned \xe2\x80\x94 now occupies most deforested land. Small farmers plant pasture after using the land for a year or two under annual crops, while large cattle ranches plant pasture directly after clearing.

Abstract: 'Amazon forests along a toposequence at San Carlos de Rio Negro (Venezuela) show distinct nutrient limitations depending on slope position. Soils were collected by genetic horizons and analysed to provide information on the relationships between soil P and N status and the nutrition of natural forest at three locations along the toposequence. The upper-slope tierra firme sites had total P concentrations between 100 and 200 \xce\xbcg g\xe2\x88\x921 in the mineral soil fines and between 700 and 1100 \xce\xbcg g\xe2\x88\x921 in lateritic nodules. Hyphae were seen to explore lateritic nodules and may contribute to P nutrition. Total P in the mineral soil of the lower slope ranged from only 3 to 130 \xce\xbcg g\xe2\x88\x921. In both the organic mats of the tierra firme and the humic horizon at the lower-slope tall Amazon caatinga site, 50\xe2\x80\x9360% of the P was in inorganic forms, which, in the absence of P-fixing mineral soil, maintain high levels of plant-available P. As a result, the litter mats and humic horizon accounted for over 70% of the total available P in these soils. The proportion of available P increased, and P sorption decreased, downslope, supporting ecological studies which found that tall Amazon caatinga was least P-limited. Soil N and C levels show a maximum at the mid-slope and a minimum at the lower slope. Distributions of biomass C, N and P closely follow those of soil C, N and available (but not total) P along the slope.'

Abstract: "One of the most striking features observed throughout tropical agricultural frontiers is the extreme variability in land-use strategies from one farmer to the next. This article analyzes the forest conversion process and predominant land uses associated with smallholder settlement expansion in the Amazon frontier. The discussion seeks to increase understanding of the micro and macro-level forces that propel land-use decisions in the Amazon and offer insights about how farmers' land-use decisions may be altered to bring about forms of resource use that are consistent with the constraints and opportunities of the frontier environment. Recognizing that no frontier area can be truly representative of the Amazon as a whole, this article also introduces some detailed evidence from another Amazon country (Ecuador) within a topic that has been previously dominated by research mainly in Brazil. The analysis suggests that to be effective, any policy or technology-based effort on the part of governments or researchers to alter colonist land-use systems must begin to look systematically at the production systems of agricultural colonist populations already present in frontier environments. This knowledge is essential to understand the social and economic factors affecting present land use and choice of technology. It is also important for understanding factors influencing farmers' demand for more optimal systems of land use that are consistent with varying agroecological potentials, demographic situations, and the management capacity of the farmer."

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82The influence of texture and local climate, especially precipitation, on C decomposition was evaluated in topsoils under forest and pastures at different sites located in the western, central, and eastern Brazilian Amazon Basin. Independent of the geographical location and vegetation cover, C decomposition was lower in topsoils of fine texture with a sand/clay ratio of less than 1, compared to topsoils of coarse a texture with a sand/clay ratio ranging from 2 to 8. In the former, the low sand/clay ratio appears to reduce C decomposition. In the latter, besides the effect of the high sand/clay ratio, the local climate, especially the annual precipitation, seems to play an important role in controlling C decomposition.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Atlantic rainforest harbours at least 129 non-volant mammal species. There is also a diverse and numerous epiphytic flora associated with this Neotropical rainforest, including several species of Araceae. Nevertheless, knowledge of the ecology of this group of plants and its interaction with animals is poor. In this study we investigated the interactions between epiphytic aroids and arboreal mammals in the Atlantic forest. We carried out the field work between November 1995 and June 1997 in the Parque Estadual Intervales, southeastern Brazil, a still well preserved forest area of approximately 490 km2. We analysed faecal samples from primates (Cebus apella and Brachyteles arachnoides), collected during observations in the field, and marsupials (Didelphis aurita, Micoureus demerarae, Gracilinanus microtarsus), collected from animals captured monthly or bi-monthly in live-traps. We recorded 17 species of Araceae in the study area. The seeds of eight species occurred in the faecal samples: Anthurium harrissi, Monstera adansonii, Philodendron corcovadense, P.\xc2\xa0appendiculatum, P.\xc2\xa0exymium, P.\xc2\xa0crassinervium, P.\xc2\xa0obliquifolium, and Heteropsis oblongifolia. Aroids were present in faecal samples of the primates during most of the year, with a mean monthly percentage of occurrence of about 56.2%. For marsupials, aroids also were a seasonally important food source, as between November and June the mean monthly percentage of occurrence in faecal samples was about 26.5%. Our data indicate that aroids are an important food source for arboreal and semi-arboreal mammals and that these animals may play an important role as seed dispersers of this group. Aroids and arboreal mammals appear to interact more strongly in Atlantic forest than in other Neotropical forests.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forest gaps are ephemeral and patchily distributed within forest areas and have very different light environments compared with closed-canopy forest. We used fruit-baited traps to investigate if gaps are exploited by more opportunistic butterfly species compared with closed-canopy forest. Gaps supported a higher diversity of butterflies in terms of species evenness but closed-canopy sites contained species with more restricted geographical distributions. There was little similarity between the assemblages of butterflies trapped in the canopy and those in either gap or closed-canopy sites, but the greater similarity was with gaps, and increased diversity in gaps was partly due to canopy species turning up in gaps. Dispersal rates (as measured by recapture rates) were higher in gaps and there was evidence that butterflies in gaps had relatively larger and broader thoraxes, indicating a flight morphology adapted for faster flight. These results support the notion of a distinctive gap fauna comprising more widespread, mobile species. Habitat modification that opens up the canopy is likely to result in an increase in these widespread species and a decline in understorey species with restricted distributions.'

Abstract: 'This study examines segregation of seven lemur species in an eastern rainforest of Madagascar by a numerical analysis of microhabitats using structural and phenological data. These data are combined with the results of a previous study on food selection by these species in relation to plant chemistry. Description of some 441 10\xc3\x9710 m2 microhabitats yields clear separation of the frugivorous from the more folivorous guild of lemurs. Within each guild there are subgroups of two species each, which use similar microhabitats. The two species of the subgroups are separated by their different reactions towards food chemicals. Thus food chemistry and microhabitat structure are two complementary axes sufficient to separate lemur species in the Malagasy rainforest. Species using the same microhabitats choose food items with different chemical properties and species eating the same food differ in their utilization of microhabitats. Only Cheirogaleus major can not be separated from the other lemur species based on habitat utilization and the chemical composition of their food. This species, however, is active only at times of food abundance and reduces its activity at times of scarcity thus avoiding potential competition. The folivorous species Avahi laniger and Indri indri use similar micro habitats for feeding and for resting, reflecting the strategy of low energy cost and fow energy return. A more folivorous species, Lemur fulvus, discriminates between feeding and resting sites based on phenological and structural variables, representing an example for behavior shaped by high cost and high energy return. Feeding sites of this species are linked to fruit abundance but the need to see but not to be seen seems to determine their choice of resting sites. This discrimination is similar to habitat choices of frugivorous primates in other tropical rainforests which have been linked to anti-predator behavior and suggests convergent evolution due to similar evolutionary selection pressure.'

Abstract: 'Slash-and-burn agriculture is an important driver of deforestation and ecosystem degradation, with large effects on biodiversity and carbon sequestration. This study was conducted in a forest in Madagascar, which consists of fragments of slash-and-burn patches, within a matrix of secondary and primary forest. By recording species richness, abundance, and composition of trees, shrubs, and herbs in fallows of various age and slash-and-burn history, and in the secondary and primary forest, we show how slash-and-burn intensity (number of cycles, duration of abandonment), years since last abandonment, and environmental factors (distance to primary forest and topography) affect the natural succession and recovery of the forest ecosystem. We used ordination analyses to examine how the species composition varied between the different successions stages, and to examine tree recruitment. Our results show shrub dominance the first years after abandonment. Thereafter, a subsequent increase in species richness and abundance of tree seedlings and saplings suggests a succession towards the diversity and composition of the secondary and primary forest, although a big gap between the oldest fallows and the secondary forest shows that this will take much more than 30\xc2\xa0years. A high number and frequency of slash-and-burn cycles decreased tree seedling and sapling richness and abundance, suggesting that reducing slash-and-burn intensity will increase the speed of tree recruitment and fallow recovery. Trees can be planted into fallows to speed up vegetation and soil recovery, such that fallows can be usable within needed time and thus the extension of cultivated areas reduced. We recommend further testing of six potential species for restoration based on their early colonization of the fallows and their survival through vegetation succession.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests have been subject to intense hunting of medium and large frugivores that are important in dispersing large-seeded species. It has been hypothesized that in areas with extinction or low abundance of medium and large-bodied animals the density of small rodents may increase. Therefore, this increment in the density of small rodents may compensate for the absence or low abundance of medium and large frugivores on seed removal and seed dispersal. Here, we fill up this gap in the literature by determining if seed removal, seed dispersal, and seed predation by small rodents (spiny rats, Trinomys inheringi and squirrels, Sciurus ingrami) are maintained in defaunated areas. We accessed seed removal, seed dispersal, seed predation, and seedling recruitment of an endemic Atlantic rainforest palm, Astrocaryum aculeatissimum, in a gradient of abundance of agoutis. We found that seed removal, scatter hoarding, and seed predation increase with the abundance of agoutis. In contrast, the proportion of dispersed but non-cached seeds decreased with the abundance of agoutis. We did not find any effect of the abundance of agoutis on seed dispersal distance, but we did find a positive trend on the density of seedlings. We concluded that small rodents do not compensate the low abundance of agoutis on seed removal, scatter hoarding, and seed predation of this palm tree. Moreover, areas in which agoutis are already extinct did not present any seed removal or scatter hoarding, not even by small rodents. This study emphasizes both the importance of agoutis in dispersing seeds of A. aculeatissimum and the collapse in seed dispersal of this palm in areas where agoutis are already extinct.'

Abstract: 'Fire usually impose considerable impacts on fauna, including loss of habitats and microhabitats, emigrations, injuries, or death. The general arquitecture of the local environment may play an important role in the extent that fire may act and the resulting burning effects. Understanding the exact extent of the effects of fire on vertebrate populations in natural environments is usually limited by the lack of information on the number of individuals dying during the event. Semi-aquatic turtles which usually move slowly on land, may suffer serious direct effects of fire. The mortality of turtles caused by fire and drought is well documented in the northern hemisphere, but few data are available from Brazil. Here we documented the death of individuals of a semi-aquatic still undescribed turtle species, Rhinoclemmys sp. n. on a coastal plain environment in southeastern Brazil, as result of a fire and a prolonged drought. Our results indicated that fire and drought contributed to the mortality of Rhinoclemmys sp. n. in the study area.'

Abstract: 'Understanding of N2O fluxes to the atmosphere is complicated by interactions between chemical and physical controls on both production and movement of the gas. To better understand how N2O production is controlled in the soil, we measured concentrations of N2O and of the proximal controllers on its production in soil water and soil air in a field study in the Rio Icacos basin of the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. A toposequence (ridge, slope-ridge break, slope, slope-riparian break, riparian, and streambank) was used that has been previously characterized for groundwater chemistry and surface N2O fluxes. The proximal controls on N2O production include NO3\xe2\x88\x92, NH4+, DOC, and O2. Nitrous oxide and O2 were measured in soil air and NO3\xe2\x88\x92, NH4+, and DO were measured in soil water. Nitrate and DOC disappeared from soil solution at the slope-riparian interface, where soil N2O concentrations increased dramatically. Soil N2O concentrations continued to increase through the flood plain and the streambank. Nitrous oxide concentrations were highest in soil air probes that had intermediate O2 concentrations. Changes in N2O concentrations in groundwater and soil air in different environments along the catena appear to be controlled by O2 concentrations. In general, N processing in the unsaturated and saturated zones differs within each topographic position apparently due to differences in redox status.'

Abstract: 'Accurate estimations of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in tropical montane rainforests are critical for assessing the role of tropical forests in influencing global climate change. This research aimed to determine the diurnal variation in soil GHG fluxes and understand the effects of forest canopy gaps on GHG fluxes, and their major controlling factors. The diurnal fluxes of soil carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) inside and outside three forest canopy gaps in a tropical montane rainforest were measured with a closed static chamber system in June 2015. The main results are as follows. (1) There was an obvious single-peak daily variation of soil GHG fluxes. (2) The averaged soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes of the whole day were closest to the daily average emission fluxes at 9:00 and 12:00 for CO2, 6:00 and 9:00 for N2O, and 9:00 and 12:00 for CH4, respectively. (3) Soil CO2 and N2O emissions (positive values) and CH4 uptake (negative values) were higher inside gaps than outside. (4) There were stronger exponential relationships between soil CO2 and N2O emissions and temperature inside gaps than outside, and there was a stronger quadratic relationship between CH4 uptake and temperature outside gaps than inside. However, significant relationships between soil CO2 (or CH4) and soil moisture only occurred inside gaps (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01). There were clear diurnal variations and significant effects of gaps on soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes. Our study indicated that understanding the different diurnal variations of soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes inside and outside canopy gaps could improve the accurate evaluation of soil GHG fluxes in tropical montane rainforests under a changing climate.'

Abstract: 'Seedlings of the Caesalpinoids Hymenaea courbaril, H. parvifolia and Copaifera venezuelana, emergent trees of Amazonian rainforest canopies, and of the Araucarian conifers Agathis microstachya and A. robusta, important elements in tropical Australian rainforests, were grown at 6% (shade) and 100% full sunlight (sun) in glasshouses. All species produced more leaves in full sunlight than in shade and leaves of sun plants contained more nitrogen and less chlorophyll per unit leaf area, and had a higher specific leaf weight than leaves of shade plants. The photosynthetic response curves as a function of photon flux density for leaves of shade-grown seedlings showed lower compensation points, higher quantum yields and lower respiration rates per unit leaf area than those of sun-grown seedlings. However, except for A. robusta, photosynthetic acclimation between sun and shade was not observed; the light saturated rates of assimilation were not significantly different. Intercellular CO2 partial pressure was similar in leaves of sun and shade-grown plants, and assimilation was limited more by intrinsic mesophyll factors than by stomata. Comparison of assimilation as a function of intercellular CO2 partial pressure in sun- and shade-grown Agathis spp. showed a higher initial slope in leaves of sun plants, which was correlated with higher leaf nitrogen content. Assimilation was reduced at high transpiration rates and substantial photoinhibition was observed when seedlings were transferred from shade to sun. However, after transfer, newly formed leaves in A. robusta showed the same light responses as leaves of sun-grown seedlings. These observations on the limited potential for acclimation to high light in leaves of seedlings of rainforest trees are discussed in relation to regeneration following formation of gaps in the canopy.'

Abstract: 'Patterns of rodent species abundance and diversity were examined over a 5\xc2\xa0months period in two areas of a Kenyan relict tropical rainforest. The two areas are subjected to different administrations which lead to various levels of anthropogenic disturbance: one can be considered relatively disturbed and one relatively undisturbed. Anthropogenic disturbance causes a reduction in woody stem density between 0 and 1.5\xc2\xa0m and reduced understory tree canopy cover. Rodent abundance was estimated using the program CAPTURE and compared with the number of individuals actually captured. Density was estimated with three different methods, two of these utilised a boundary strip to estimate effective size of the area trapped. Density resulted in being relatively high in both areas, so population might have been at a peak. Species richness was higher in the disturbed forest, while species diversity and evenness was higher in the undisturbed forest. We suggest that in the disturbed forest the increase in number of species might be due to sporadical entrance in the forest by non-forest species, while the decrease in diversity might be due to the decrease of lower strata vegetation that occurs in the disturbed forest, hence this factor might affect species equitability. Bibliographic data supports this hypothesis as rodent species diversity and ground vegetation cover have been found to be correlated.'

Abstract: 'The combined effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change on biodiversity and biotic interactions are poorly understood. In the context of ongoing deforestation and agricultural intensification in the tropics secondary rainforest fragments might contribute to biodiversity conservation and mitigation of climate warming. This study investigated the interactive effects of habitat fragmentation and microclimate on the abundance and biotic interactions of trap-nesting bees and wasps in secondary forest fragments in the northwestern lowlands of Costa Rica. Fragment size did not affect hymenopteran abundance, parasitism and mortality rates, but all variables differed between edge and interior locations in the forest fragments. Interactive effects between size and location indicate higher mortality rates at interior locations in larger fragments. Microclimatic differences at edge and interior locations led to significant effects on all tested response variables. Abundance at interior locations was significantly higher with increasing temperatures. Mortality rates at interior location increased at lower mean temperatures, whereas higher temperatures at edges marginally increased mortality rates. Our results indicate that edge effects, mediated by altered microclimatic conditions, significantly change biotic interactions of trap-nesting hymenopterans in small secondary fragments.'

Abstract: 'The vertical distribution, microenvironmental preference, canopy cover, as well as monthly fluctuations of recently described species of three genera of macropyline oribatid mites, Mesoplophora, Bicyrthermannia and Nothrus and three genera of brachypyline mites, Scheloribates, Muliercula and Galumnella were investigated over a 9-month period in shaded and unshaded areas of a secondary regrowth forest floor in Ile Ife, Nigeria. Sampling was done monthly from August 2002 to April 2003 covering the two seasons of the annual cycle. There was an overwhelming predominance of mite populations in the 5\xc2\xa0cm topsoil compared with the fermentation and litter layers. The preference of M. ifeana and B. nigeriana extracted from the topsoil for the shaded plot was attributed to highly conducive moisture conditions provided by the canopy. It is suggested that M. ifeana, B. nigeriana, N. lasebikani, S. mochlosimilaris, M. inexpectata and G. sonpona, that exhibited a single peak density in the wet season in this study, had similar ecological needs. The populations of M. ifeana and S. mochlosimilaris were relatively stable in the fermentation layer. The study concluded that canopy cover affected the sensitivity of soil dwelling mites on the floor of a secondary regrowth forest with regard to vertical gradients of light, microclimate and foliage quality in a complex way.'

Abstract: 'A challenge in establishing agroforestry systems is ensuring that farmers are interested in the tree species, and are aware of how to adequately manage these species. This challenge was tackled in the Atlantic Rainforest biome (Brazil), where a participatory trial with agroforestry coffee systems was carried out, followed by a participatory systematisation of the farmers experiences. Our objective was to identify the main tree species used by farmers as well as their criteria for selecting or rejecting tree species. Furthermore, we aimed to present a specific inventory of trees of the Leguminosae family. In order to collect the data, we reviewed the bibliography of the participatory trial, visited and interviewed the farmers and organised workshops with them. The main farmers\xe2\x80\x99 criteria for selecting tree species were compatibility with coffee, amount of biomass, production and the labour needed for tree management. The farmers listed 85 tree species; we recorded 28 tree species of the Leguminosae family. Most trees were either native to the biome or exotic fruit trees. In order to design and manage complex agroforestry systems, family farmers need sufficient knowledge and autonomy, which can be reinforced when a participatory methodology is used for developing on-farm agroforestry systems. In the case presented, the farmers learned how to manage, reclaim and conserve their land. The diversification of production, especially with fruit, contributes to food security and to a low cost/benefit ratio of agroforestry systems. The investigated agroforestry systems showed potential to restore the degraded landscape of the Atlantic Rainforest biome.'

Abstract: 'Tropical rainforests are characterized by having high structural complexity, stratification, and species diversity. In Colombia, tropical rainforests are critically endangered with only 24% of their area remaining. Forest fragments are often valued based on the presence of vertebrate taxa despite that small habitat remnants may still harbor diverse invertebrate communities. We surveyed the ant fauna associated with rainforest fragments and their surrounding landscape elements (including mature forests, flooded forests, gallery forests, live fences, and pastures) in the Magdalena River watershed. Pitfall traps and litter samples were used to estimate ant richness and diversity, and to compare ant composition among landscape elements. We found 135 species from 42 genera, representing 16% of the species and 43% of the genera known for Colombia. Our surveys also uncovered 11 new ant records for the Colombian inter-Andean region and 2 new records for the country of Colombia: Mycocepurus curvispinosus (Mackay) and Rhopalothrix isthmica (Weber). The highest species richness was found in forest-covered sites, and richness and diversity was lower in the disturbed landscapes surrounding the forest patches. Species composition varied significantly between all habitat types, but was most similar between forest types suggesting that a loss of structural complexity has the greatest effect on ant communities. Across our study sites, ten species showed the greatest response to habitat type and could qualify as indicator taxa for this region. We conclude by discussing the value of conserving even small forests in this landscape due to their ability to retain high diversity of ants.'

Abstract: 'We studied the pollination and reproductive success in continuous and fragmented populations of Lapageria rosea, a self-compatible plant endemic to temperate forests of Chile. Pollinator abundance, visitation rates, flower abundance, nectar volume and concentration, pollen germination and fruit and seed production, were compared between continuous forest of 145\xc2\xa0ha and four forest fragments of 6, 3, 3, and 1\xc2\xa0ha respectively, surrounded by mature pine plantations of Pinus radiata. Flower abundance was lower in three out of four forest fragments relative to continuous forest. Nectar volume and sugar concentration did not differ between flowers in the two habitats. Pollinators of L. rosea, the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes and bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii were less abundant and visited flowers of L. rosea at lower rates in fragments than in continuous forest. In addition, in vitro rates of pollen germination were lower for flowers in forest fragments. The number of seeds per fruit was also lower in forest fragments. We suggest that fragmentation affects the reproductive success of L. rosea, lowering the total numbers of seeds produced and possibly compromising long term persistence of fragmented populations.'

Abstract: 'As a result of habitat fragmentation, the environmental structures of forest remnants change and alter their microclimatic conditions. Edaphic beetles comprise several families that are considered effective bioindicators. In this study, we analyzed how environmental parameters and fragment size affect edaphic beetle assemblage in a fragmented rainforest landscape in Brazil. Beetles were sampled in 12 forest fragments using pitfall traps. Fragment size, tree density and diameter, litter depth and dry weight, and canopy cover were measured in each forest fragment. Staphylinidae and Carabidae were the beetle families with the highest species richness, whereas Scarabaeidae and Nitidulidae were the most abundant families. Beetle abundance was positively affected by litter dry weight and fragment size. In addition, species composition was significantly affected by fragment area. In conclusion, forest patch size is an important parameter for maintaining edaphic beetle assemblages in tropical rainforests, causing major shifts in its abundance and species distribution.'

Abstract: 'Monthly stem increment of 766 trees was assessed for 7\xc2\xa0years in Kakamega Forest, Kenya and related to monthly climatic variables. Mean stem increment of all tree individuals correlated negatively with maximum temperature but not with mean and minimum temperatures. For the precipitation variables sum of precipitation and number of rainy days we found positive correlations. Stem increment of the trees in the early-, mid-, and late-successional groups correlated positively with the number of rainy days. For late-successional trees increment correlated negatively with mean and maximum temperature and positively with all other precipitation variables. For mid-successional trees we found a negative correlation with mean temperature. In addition, the stem increment of most species related positively to precipitation variables and negatively to mean and maximum temperature. In view of the expected increasing temperatures and fewer but heavier rain events, our results suggest that climate change will lead to a reduction in stem increment. The results appertaining to the successional groups imply that early and mid-successional species are better equipped to perform well under the expected future climatic conditions than the late-successional species. This could reduce the role of this East African forest as a carbon store. As the responses to climatic variables were highly group- and species-specific it is likely that climate change will result in a species composition shift, presumably in favour of drought-resistant and heat-tolerating species.'

Abstract: ' In a tropical rainforest of Madagascar, tree species differed in average wood density depending on their light requirements and on the soil type. Tree diameter had no effect. None of these factors influenced the variation of density related to the distance to the pith. '

Abstract: "Foliar samples were obtained from symbiotic nitrogen-fixers and control plants (non-fixers) along elevational and primary successional gradients in volcanic sites in Hawai'i. Most control plants had negative \xce\xb415N values (range-10.1 to +0.7\xe2\x80\xb0), while most nitrogen-fixers were near 0\xe2\x80\xb0. Foliar 15N in the native tree Metrosideros polymorpha did not vary with elevation (from sea level to tree-line), but it did increase substantially towards 0\xe2\x80\xb0 on older soils. The soil in an 197-yr-old site had a \xce\xb415N value of approximately-2\xe2\x80\xb0, while in a \xe2\x88\xbc67000-yr-old site it was +3.6\xe2\x80\xb0. We suggest that inputs of 15N-depleted nitrogen from precipitation coupled with very low nitrogen outputs cause the strongly negative \xce\xb415N values in non-nitrogen-fixing plants on early successional sites."

Abstract: 'The spatial distribution of orchid bees was analyzed in a mosaic of tropical rainforest and rubber tree groves in the Atlantic coast of Brazil (ARRF), comparing abundances and species compositions between replicas of the following landscape elements: small and large forest fragments, and rubber tree groves. Species compositions responded to all of the factors examined (time, mosaic elements, and distances; P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.009). In contrast, total orchid bee abundance varied significantly only over time (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.0001), but not among the different mosaic elements (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.05). Fragment size and distances between the fragments have affected species composition and abundance of some few common species. Most local species were present in the rubber plantation, and several species were using this matrix as a source of odor. The seasonal quality shifting of this matrix (leaf fall) has had less influence on the spatial distribution of orchid bees than the distances between forest fragments and fragment sizes. Previous studies of forest fragmentation have shown very weak effects of matrix isolation in mosaics with 5 to 90\xc2\xa0% of forest cover, which supports the generalized expectation that organisms with well-developed dispersal capacities can respond to much higher thresholds of forest fragmentation.'

Abstract: ' One possible function of extrafloral nectaries is to attract insects, particularly ants, which defend plants from herbivores. We determined whether ants visiting saplings of the tree Stryphnodendronmicrostachyum (Leguminosae) provide protection (decreased plant damage due to ant molestation or killing of herbivores) and benefit (increased plant growth and reproduction associated with ant presence) to the plant. We compared ant and herbivore abundance, herbivore damage and growth of ant-visited plants and ant-excluded plants grown in sun and shade microhabitats of a 6-ha plantation in Costa Rica over a 7-month period. Results show that ants provided protection to plants not by reducing herbivore numbers but by molesting herbivores. Ants also reduced the incidence of pathogen attack on leaves. Protection was greater in the shade than in the sun, probably due to lower herbivore attack in the sun. Protection was also variable within sun and shade habitats, and this variability appeared to be related to variable ant visitation. Results also indicate that ant presence benefits the plant: ant-visited plants grew significantly more in height than ant-excluded plants. The cultivation of ants may serve as an important natural biological control in tropical forestry and agroforestry systems, where increased plant density can otherwise lead to increased herbivore attack.'

Abstract: 'Quantitative genetic diversity is a fundamental component of the interaction between natural populations and their environment. In breeding programmes, quantitative genetic studies on tropical trees have so far focused on fast-growing, light-demanding species, but no information exists on shade-tolerant, slow-growing species. For this study, 27 3-year-old open-pollinated families of the Neotropical shade-tolerant rainforest tree Sextonia rubra were measured in semicontrolled conditions for 20 morphological, growth, and photosynthesis traits; the effect of genetic relatedness, habitat of provenance, and mother tree status on seedling traits was analysed. Nine traits displayed significant genetic effects, while mother tree status and habitat effects were not significant (P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.05) for an y trait. Estimated heritability varied between 0.14 and 0.28, with growth-related traits having the highest values. Additive genetic variation correlated positively with nonheritable variation, suggesting that ecological\xe2\x80\x93evolutionary factors increasing or decreasing additive genetic variance may also affect nonheritable variation in the same direction. Our results suggest that quantitative genetic variability should be taken into account in ecological studies on, and in the management of, natural tropical rainforests; further research is needed to investigate genetic \xc3\x97 environment interactions, in particular from the point of view of the genetic response of shade-tolerant plant species to variations in light availability.'

Abstract: 'Increasing anthropogenic disturbance in tropical rainforests is a major challenge to biodiversity conservation. The responses of herbivorous insect communities to habitat changes are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the resilience of galling insect communities associated with Neoboutonia macrocalyx (Euphorbiaceae) trees to logging in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Resilience was measured by comparing the species density, abundance and community structure of gallers in nine differently aged successional forests with those in adjacent primary forests. Insect galls were sampled from the canopy of 10 randomly selected trees in each successional stage, five times in a 10-month period. A total of 7219 individuals representing five galler species were recorded. No significant differences were found in the species density and overall density of gallers between the regenerating and primary forests. The mean tree height was positively correlated with the overall density of gallers. The community structure of gallers differed significantly among the successional stages, but exhibited no clear directional recovery trend. In addition, remarkable seasonal variations were observed in galler communities, with peak abundance being found in the wettest months. The results of the preset study indicate that specialist galling insects whose hosts are pioneer trees can recolonize successional sites rapidly and are resilient to the effects of selective and clear-cut logging in case primary or secondary forests with an established population of Neoboutonia host trees (source populations) are close by. Thus, recovering tropical forests can provide important habitats for galling insect biodiversity, highlighting the need to include them in management and conservation priority plans.'

Abstract: 'The patterns of the distribution of fungal species and their potential interactions with trees remain understudied in Neotropical rainforests, which harbor more than 16,000 tree species, mostly dominated by endomycorrhizal trees. Our hypothesis was that tree species shape the non-mycorrhizal fungal assemblages in soil and litter and that the diversity of fungal communities in these two compartments is partly dependent on the coverage of trees in the Neotropical rainforest. In French Guiana, a long-term plantation and a natural forest were selected to test this hypothesis. Fungal ITS1 regions were sequenced from soil and litter samples from within the vicinity of tree species. A broad range of fungal taxa was found, with 42 orders and 14 classes. Significant spatial heterogeneity in the fungal communities was found without strong variation in the species richness and evenness among the tree plots. However, tree species shaped the fungal assemblages in the soil and litter, explaining up to 18\xc2\xa0% of the variation among the communities in the natural forest. These results demonstrate that vegetation cover has an important effect on the structure of fungal assemblages inhabiting the soil and litter in Amazonian forests, illustrating the relative impact of deterministic processes on fungal community structures in these highly diverse ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'We compiled a time series of Earth Observing-1 Hyperion satellite observations with field measurements to compare the structural, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of an invasive nitrogen-fixing tree Myrica faya and native Metrosideros polymorpha in montane rainforests in Hawai\xe2\x80\x99i. Satellite-based canopy water measurements closely tracked variations in leaf area index, and the remotely sensed photochemical and carotenoid reflectance indices (PRI, CRI) indicated variations in upper-canopy leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid content during a climatological transition. The PRI and CRI were related to differences in light-use efficiency of each species, as indicated by field measurements of leaf electron transport rate. The suite of hyperspectral metrics indicated maximum differences in the structure, biochemistry, and physiology of Myrica and Metrosideros when canopy vapor pressure deficit was high during hotter and drier periods. These satellite data, combined with the Carnegue-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) carbon cycle model, suggested that Myrica growth rates were 16\xe2\x80\x9344% higher than Metrosideros, with relative differences between species closely linked to climate conditions. The satellite hyperspectral data identified the basic biological mechanisms favoring the spread of an introduced tree, and provided a more detailed understanding of how vegetation\xe2\x80\x93climate interactions affect the time course of plant growth with respect to the invasion process.'

Abstract: 'Tadpoles are found in diverse aquatic habitats, where they share resources in various dimensions. Tadpole assemblages were studied in two temporary ponds in Atlantic Rainforest. Our aim was to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution patterns and their correlation with abiotic factors. Tadpoles were sampled weekly using nets, from March to December 2008. Samples were collected during the day and at night, and taken near the shore and in the centre of the ponds. Samples in inshore and pond centres were taken from both areas with and without aquatic vegetation. The assemblage consisted of 15 species in pond A and 12 species in pond B. The majority of species was accidental, and used the pond continuously. The assemblage was predominantly diurnal, which may be related to greater activity rate. In pond A the tadpoles primarily used the centre of ponds, whereas in pond B tadpoles primarily used shore areas. However, some populations showed preferences for particular environments. In pond A, environmental heterogeneity in the centre had the greatest influence on tadpole abundance. Our data suggest that temporal distribution facilitated the coexistence of different species of tadpoles in the pond but this conclusion is tentative and requires verification. Hence, more data needs to be collected so that we can propose effective area management plans.'

Abstract: 'Forestry plantations represent about 4\xc2\xa0% of the global land cover and demand for wood is steadily increasing worldwide. Impacts of forest plantations on biodiversity are controversial; forest plantations could positively influence biodiversity by producing a buffer zone between native forests and agriculture, while replacement of native forests with plantations could reduce biodiversity. Chile is one of the main producers of wood worldwide, and production is largely based on intensively managed monocultures of exotic tree species. Only a few studies have looked at the effects of forestry plantations on biodiversity in Chile, mainly focusing on pine plantations. The aim of this study was to characterize habitat use and richness of bats between native forests, eucalyptus plantations and grasslands in a biodiversity hotspot in southern Chile to determine how land use affects an important mammalian taxa. We found no difference in use or richness of bats in eucalyptus plantations versus native forests. Regional context within the larger Valdivian watershed (Andes, central valley, coastal range) had a stronger influence on bat activity and richness than land use type (native forest, plantation, grassland), with the Andean region being the most diverse and where most bat activity is concentrated. Our results suggest that the composition and structure of the surrounding landscape mosaic may be fundamental to determine the impacts of forestry and human land use on biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Neotropical rainforests are global biodiversity hotspots and are challenging to restore. A core part of this challenge is the very long recovery trajectory of the system: recovery of structure can take 20\xe2\x80\x93190\xc2\xa0years, species composition 60\xe2\x80\x93500\xc2\xa0years, and reestablishment of rare/endemic species thousands of years. Passive recovery may be fraught with instances of arrested succession, disclimax or emergence of novel ecosystems. In these cases, active restoration methods are essential to speed recovery and set a desired restoration trajectory. Tree plantation is the most common active approach to reestablish a high density of native tree species and facilitate understory regeneration. While this approach may speed the successional trajectory, it may not achieve, and possibly inhibit, a long-term restoration trajectory towards the high species diversity characteristic of these forests. A range of nucleation techniques (e.g., tree island planting) are important restoration options: although they may not speed recovery of structure as quickly as plantations, their emphasis on natural regeneration processes may enable greater and more natural patterns of diversity to develop. While more work needs to be done to compare forest restoration techniques in different environmental contexts, it appears that nucleation and, at times, passive restoration may best preserve the diverse legacy of these forested systems (both with lower costs). An integrated approach using both plantation productivity but also the natural functions associated with nucleation may develop composition and diversity trajectory desired in Neotropical conservation efforts.'

Abstract: ' In this study, we demonstrate that an important benefit provided by the small host-specific ant Petalomyrmex phylax to its host plant Leonardoxa africana is efficient protection against herbivores. We estimate that in the absence of ants, insect herbivory would reduce the leaf area by about one-third. This contributes considerably to the fitness of the plant. Our estimates take into account not only direct damage, such as removal of leaf surface by chewing insects, but also the effects of sucking insects on leaf growth and expansion. Sucking insects are numerically predominant in this system, and the hitherto cryptic effects of ant protection against the growth-reducing effects of sucking insects accounted for half of the total estimated benefit of ant protection. We propose that the small size of workers confers a distinct advantage in this system. Assuming that resource limitation implies a trade off between size and number of ants, and given the small size of phytophagous insects that attack Leonardoxa, we conclude that fine-grained patrolling by a large number of small workers maximises protection of young leaves of this plant. Since herbivores are small and must complete their development on the young leaves of Leonardoxa, and since a high patrolling density is required for a fine-grained search for these enemies, numerous small ants should provide the most effective protection of young leaves of Leonardoxa. We also discuss other factors that may have influenced worker size in this ant.'

Abstract: 'We present a case study of the relationship between spatial genetic structure (SGS) and age structure in Protium spruceanum (Burseraceae), an insect-pollinated, mass-fruiting, and secondary bird-dispersed tree, as determined through variation in allozyme loci. Using ten polymorphic loci, we investigated spatial and temporal patterns of a genetic structure within a 40\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8960\xc2\xa0m plot in a small (1.0\xc2\xa0ha) fragment of Atlantic Rainforest to investigate the processes shaping the distribution of genetic diversity. Individuals (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89345) from seedlings to adults were grouped and analyzed in four diameter classes. The results showed a high average level of genetic diversity (H e\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.438), but genetic diversity parameters did not vary significantly among cohorts. The spatial distribution pattern analysis of individuals showed significant levels of aggregation among small- and medium-diameter classes and random distribution among the highest diameter class, likely due to processes of competitive thinning. There was an association between demographic and SGS at short distances (less than 10\xc2\xa0m) which is likely the consequence of restricted seed dispersal. The degree of SGS decreased across small- to large-diameter classes. We inferred that limited seed dispersal and subsequent density-dependent mortality from the family clusters are responsible for the observed changes in fine-scale SGS across different demographic classes.'

Abstract: 'Epiphytes are often assumed to influence the microclimatic conditions of the tree crowns that they inhabit. In order to quantify this notion, we measured the parameters "temperature" (of the substrate surface and the boundary layer of air above it), "evaporative drying rate" and "evapotranspiration" at various locations within tree crowns with differing epiphyte assemblages. The host tree species was Annona glabra, which was either populated by one of three epiphyte species (Dimerandra emarginata, Tillandsia fasciculata, or Vriesea sanguinolenta) or was epiphyte-free. We found that during the hottest and driest time of day, microsites in the immediate proximity of epiphytes had significantly lower temperatures than epiphyte-bare locations within the same tree crown, even though the latter were also shaded by host tree foliage or branches. Moreover, water loss through evaporative drying at microsites adjacent to epiphytes was almost 20% lower than at exposed microsites. We also found that, over the course of several weeks, the evapotranspiration in tree crowns bearing epiphytes was significantly lower than in trees without epiphytes. Although the influence of epiphytes on temperature extremes and evaporation rates is relatively subtle, their mitigating effect could be of importance for small animals like arthropods inhabiting an environment as harsh and extreme as the tropical forest canopy.'

Abstract: 'An internal household survey of socioeconomic indicators in the Cross River State forest communities showed that basic infrastructural facilities such as clean water supply, adequate waste disposal system, good roads and electricity are grossly inadequate. There is a total absence of modern family planning practices in the communities, and population is projected to increase by 44.8% between 2000 and 2015 and 85.4% between 2000 and 2025. The study revealed that about 65% of the population of the rainforest communities consists of subsistence farmers and power chain operators, and besides the 19% of the Cross River State Tropical High Forestry (THF) already reported to have been lost to agriculture and plantation between 1972 and 1991, about 9% was lost between 1991 and 2000. An additional 25% of the THF will be lost by 2025, leaving only 470600 hectares (4706 km2). With 84.1% of community members having an annual income less than $300, the survival potential of the Cross River State rainforest in the next fifty years is very low, unless an effective forest management programme is encouraged by government in partnership with all stakeholders.'

There was an association between demographic and SGS at short distances (less than 10\xc2\xa0m) which is likely the consequence of restricted seed dispersal. The degree of SGS decreased across small- to large-diameter classes. We inferred that limited seed dispersal and subsequent density-dependent mortality from the family clusters are responsible for the observed changes in fine-scale SGS across different demographic classes.'

Abstract: 'Epiphytes are often assumed to influence the microclimatic conditions of the tree crowns that they inhabit. In order to quantify this notion, we measured the parameters "temperature" (of the substrate surface and the boundary layer of air above it), "evaporative drying rate" and "evapotranspiration" at various locations within tree crowns with differing epiphyte assemblages. The host tree species was Annona glabra, which was either populated by one of three epiphyte species (Dimerandra emarginata, Tillandsia fasciculata, or Vriesea sanguinolenta) or was epiphyte-free. We found that during the hottest and driest time of day, microsites in the immediate proximity of epiphytes had significantly lower temperatures than epiphyte-bare locations within the same tree crown, even though the latter were also shaded by host tree foliage or branches. Moreover, water loss through evaporative drying at microsites adjacent to epiphytes was almost 20% lower than at exposed microsites. We also found that, over the course of several weeks, the evapotranspiration in tree crowns bearing epiphytes was significantly lower than in trees without epiphytes. Although the influence of epiphytes on temperature extremes and evaporation rates is relatively subtle, their mitigating effect could be of importance for small animals like arthropods inhabiting an environment as harsh and extreme as the tropical forest canopy.'

Abstract: 'An internal household survey of socioeconomic indicators in the Cross River State forest communities showed that basic infrastructural facilities such as clean water supply, adequate waste disposal system, good roads and electricity are grossly inadequate. There is a total absence of modern family planning practices in the communities, and population is projected to increase by 44.8% between 2000 and 2015 and 85.4% between 2000 and 2025. The study revealed that about 65% of the population of the rainforest communities consists of subsistence farmers and power chain operators, and besides the 19% of the Cross River State Tropical High Forestry (THF) already reported to have been lost to agriculture and plantation between 1972 and 1991, about 9% was lost between 1991 and 2000. An additional 25% of the THF will be lost by 2025, leaving only 470600 hectares (4706 km2). With 84.1% of community members having an annual income less than $300, the survival potential of the Cross River State rainforest in the next fifty years is very low, unless an effective forest management programme is encouraged by government in partnership with all stakeholders.'

Abstract: 'Detailed information on the ground-dwelling ant diversity and distribution in the rainforests of the Congo Basin is lacking so far. A new ant species list from a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest on the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon is presented. We investigated the effect of vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and 2004\xe2\x80\x932005. Our site in Cameroon had a total observed ant diversity of 145 species. Vegetation type significantly influenced the ground-dwelling and -foraging (arboreal) ant assemblages. Differences in species density, activity and composition between vegetation types were explained not only by soil type (hydromorphous \xe2\x80\x93 terra firme), but also by developmental stage of vegetation types. The highly inundated Raphia-swamp had the lowest ant species density and activity. Older secondary forests still had a different species composition than near primary forest even after 25 years of recovery after anthropogenic disturbance. Finally, the high ant species number captured by our pitfalls, the absence of the invasive exotic ant Wasmannia auropunctata and the high Dorylus (Anomma) army ant diversity confirm the importance of the Cameroonian rainforest for biodiversity conservation programs.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the role and use of portable sawmills in north Queensland. Using a semi-structured questionnaire and personal interviews, the opinions of 18 operators of portable and fixed-site sawmills were canvassed on a number of issues including main problems faced by the local industry, current sources of timber, sawn timber recovery rates of their operations, willingness to purchase new milling and other equipment, opinions about why (or if) portable sawmills can sell timber at a lower cost than fixed-site mills, and destinations of sawn timber milled. The most critical issues faced by sawmillers were the lack of resource security and competing products, in particular competition from imported tropical timbers from neighbouring island countries including Papua New Guinea. Most sawmillers in north Queensland currently obtain logs mainly from private landholdings and are hesitant to invest in new equipment due to concerns about future log supplies. This paper also explores the current and potential role of portable sawmills in the regional small-scale forestry industry. An examination of policy issues suggests that there may be a need for new legislation to cover employees, sawn timber consumers and sawmillers themselves. The future role of portable sawmills may require a co-operative approach that emphasizes low volume value-adding, due to the decreasing supply of logs in North Queensland.'

Abstract: 'Drought is predicted to have a profound impact on soil respiration. This study aimed to assess the effects of long-term precipitation decrease on soil respiration in a tropical rainforest.'

Abstract: ' We review the recent findings on the influence of drought on tree mortality, growth or ecosystem functioning in tropical rainforests. Drought plays a major role in shaping tropical rainforests and the response mechanisms are highly diverse and complex. The numerous gaps identified here require the international scientific community to combine efforts in order to conduct comprehensive studies in tropical rainforests on the three continents. These results are essential to simulate the future of these ecosystems under diverse climate scenarios and to predict the future of the global earth carbon balance. '

Abstract: 'The cultivation and traffic of coca, Erythrolxylum coca, and coca derivatives remain understudied threats to the conservation of the Amazon rainforest. Currently the crop is transforming land use and livelihoods in the ecologically and culturally rich borderlands of Amazonian Peru. The isolated nature of this region characterized by indigenous populations (both settled and uncontacted), conservation units, resource concessions, and a lack of state presence provides fertile ground for the boom and bust cycle of coca production and facilitates the international transport of the product to neighboring Brazil. This paper explores the social and environmental impacts of coca production, eradication, and transport through an analysis of both spatial and ethnographic data on land use and livelihood strategies along the Ucayali and Pur\xc3\xbas Rivers. Results map out the regional distribution and recent history of commercial coca fields and transboundary transportation routes and identify threats to the conservation of indigenous landscapes and borderland forests.'

Abstract: 'This paper seeks to broaden the application of demographyto environmental studies by complementing existing macro-level approaches, which feature aggregate populations, with a micro-level approach that highlights household life cycles. I take up the case of small farm households in the Brazilian Amazon to present a theoretical framework that identifies demographic characteristics which dispose families to engage in different forms of land use as household age structures change. Empirical models show that net of theeffects of farmer background, neighborhood context, institutional context, and off-farm incomes, demographic variables indicative of the household life cycle exert significant effects on the prominence of land uses with distinct environmental ramifications. The findings not only reveal micro-level demographic factors which affect Amazon land cover, they yield implications forfuture changes in rainforest landscapes in northern Brazil, and suggest household life cycle models as an avenue for further demographic research on environmental change in Latin America and other contexts.'

Abstract: 'A web GIS (WGIS) system for the Brazilian Amazon, named ImazonGeo and based on open source and public domain data, is presented. ImazonGeo was built following three principles. First, the system is based on Spatial Data Infrastructure architecture and web interface built using free software and public domain data. Second, we went beyond visualization of maps and spatial queries by providing information obtained with spatial analysis models. To do that, we designed a database that stores the results of previously defined spatial analyses and developed customized reports and query tools to facilitate fast access of information by end-users. Finally, the system is application-oriented in the areas of forest monitoring, conservation and forest law enforcement, meaning that it aims to contribute to support the protection of Brazilian Amazon forests. We illustrate these principles by presenting ImazonGeo\xe2\x80\x99s technology, architecture, content and tools. Moreover, we present two successful cases to demonstrate how the system is being used. We conclude the paper discussing the challenges and potential solutions to turning our WGIS-SDI system into an internet hub of geo-information about the Brazilian Amazon.'

Abstract: "Since 1985, Ecuador's Ministry of Agriculture has undertaken a demonstration project to promote improved agroforestry practices in already cleared lands of Ecuador's Amazon lowlands to promote regeneration of deforested areas. An important expected outcome of this project is to ameliorate growing population pressures on remaining national forests and natural reserves. These practices include managing natural regeneration of marketable timber trees intercropped to Coffea canephora var. robusta and grass-legume associations, using adequate techniques of coffee pruning, and planting Desmodium ovalifolium CIAT 350 as a ground cover crop or a forage legume in paddocks of the genus Brachiaria. This research was conducted to assess the potential economic impact of such a strategy and to feed back information on research and policy issues."

Abstract: 'Four new species of the Didymopanax group of Neotropical Schefflera (Araliaceae) from the Brazilian Amazon are here described and illustrated. Two of these are mainly known from the surroundings of Manaus, Amazonas state (Schefflera ciliatifolia and Schefflera umbrosa). The first is distinguished by its ciliate leaflets, while the second is characterized by leaflets varying in shape from trilobed to entire. Schefflera plurifolia is known only from southern Amazonian forests, and is remarkable in its pinnately-compound leaflets. Schefflera dichotoma, only known from the type collected on \xe2\x80\x9ccampinarana\xe2\x80\x9d forests from Upper Rio Negro, at the municipality of S\xc3\xa3o Gabriel da Cachoeira (Amazonas), is characterized by dichotomously branching inflorescences. Comments on the geographic distribution and ecology of the new species are provided, as well as an identification key to the species of the Didymopanax group found in Brazilian Amazonian rainforests and savannas.'

Abstract: 'The main hypotheses proposed to explain barrier formation separating populations and causing the differentiation of vertebrate species in Amazonia are based on different (mostly historical) factors, as follows. (1) Changes in the distribution of land and sea or in the landscape due to tectonic movements or sea-level fluctuations (Paleogeography hypothesis). (2) The barrier effect of Amazonian rivers (River hypothesis). (3) A combination of the barrier effect of broad rivers and vegetational changes in Northern and Southern Amazonia (River-refuge hypothesis). (4) The isolation of forest blocks near areas of surface relief in the periphery of Amazonia during dry climatic periods of the Tertiary and Quaternary (Refuge theory). (5) Competitive species interactions and local species isolations in peripheral regions of Amazonia due to invasion and counterinvasion during cold/warm periods of the Pleistocene (Disturbance-vicariance hypothesis). (6) Parapatric speciation across steep environmental gradients without separation of the representative populations (Gradient hypothesis). Several of these hypotheses are probably relevant to a different degree for the speciation processes in different faunal groups or during different geological periods. The paleogeography hypothesis refers mainly to faunal differentiation during the Tertiary and in combination with the Refuge hypothesis; Milankovitch cycles leading to global climatic-vegetational changes affected the biomes of the world not only during the Pleistocene but also during the Tertiary and earlier geological periods. New geoscientific evidence for the effect of dry climatic periods in Amazonia supports the predictions of the Refuge theory.'

Abstract: 'This paper compares the non-deltaic, riparian-flooded forests of the Orinoco and Amazon River basins. Ecological relationships between these forests and their environments that can be useful in establishing schemes for biodiversity conservation are identified. Adaptations of species to flow seasonality, flooding intensity, sedimentation pattern and nutrient depletion are described. The variability and diversity of riparian-flooded forests is related to (i) landscape evolution (regional-scale, long-term), (ii) water quality (basin scale, long-term) and (iii) hydrology and geomorphology (sector-scale, medium-term). The floristic analysis has produced a preliminary list of 242 tree species common to the riparian-flooded forests of both basins. This relatively high number of species is related to connectivity between the riparian corridors of both basins and the effective operation of dispersal mechanisms. Highly oligotrophic environments add uniqueness at the regional scale through the evolution of endemic species presenting adaptations not only to flooding but also to nutrient depletion. The process of genetic diversification and the evolution of genotypes adapted to flooding are suggested to explain longitudinal gradients at tributary junctions and floodplain-upland ecotones where current fluvial dynamics are unpredictable over ecological time scales. The paper presents information that may be used to devise appropriate measures to evaluate sites for riparian biodiversity conservation and management.'

Abstract: 'We analysed movement parameters and vertical stratification in fruit-feeding butterflies between a control, a thinned and a plantation site within a West African rainforest. Overall, distances moved between traps were largest in the plantation. Movement parameters were generally largest in species feeding on early successional hostplants of gap and margin habitats. In these species, distances between recaptures were significantly shorter in the thinned compared to the control forest. Conversely, forest floor species feeding on climbers and understorey shrubs showed significantly larger movement in the thinned forest. Higher strata species also flew larger distances in the thinned understorey. Including higher strata samples, they were significantly less abundant in the thinned plot, although understorey sampling alone indicated the contrary. Comparing vertical distribution patterns between thinned and control sites indicated a disruption of vertical stratification after thinning. Canopy species seem to fly in the upper strata of the more closed-canopy control forest, whereas they descend more frequently in the forest opened by the thinning management. Understorey sampling might therefore lead to biased conclusions due to differences in vertical distribution between forest plots. This study showed that thinning can affect the restricted-range forest floor butterflies as well as the more widespread canopy butterfly fauna.'

Abstract: 'Genetic tagging, the unique identification of individuals by their DNA profile, has proven to be an effective method for research on several animal species. In this study we apply non-invasive genetic tagging from feather samples to reveal the genetic structure and estimate local population size of red-and-green macaws (Ara chloropterus) without the need to capture these animals. The study was centered in the Tambopata region of the Peruvian Amazon. Here macaws frequently visit clay licks and their naturally molted feathers provide a unique source of non-invasively sampled DNA. We analyzed 249 feathers using nine microsatellite loci and identified 221 unique genotypes. The remainder revealed 21 individuals which were \xe2\x80\x98recaptured\xe2\x80\x99 one or more times. Using a capture-mark-recapture model the average number of different individuals visiting clay licks within one breeding season was estimated to fall between 84 and 316 individuals per clay lick. Analysis of population genetic structure revealed only small genetic differences among regions and clay licks, suggesting a single red-and-green macaw genetic population. Our study confirms the utility of non-invasive genetic tagging in harsh tropical environment to obtain crucial population parameters about an abundant parrot species that is very difficult to capture in the wild.'

Abstract: 'The use of pesticides to increase agricultural production can result in the contamination of the environment, causing changes in the genetic structure of organisms and in the loss of biodiversity. This practice is also inducing changes in the rainforest ecosystem. In this work, a Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from a preservation soil area of the Brazilian Amazon Forest, without usage of any pesticide, was evaluated for its potential to degrade atrazine. This isolate presented all responsible genes (atzA, atzB, atzC, atzD, atzE, and atzF) for atrazine mineralization and demonstrated capacity to use atrazine as a nitrogen source, having achieved a reduction of 44\xc2\xa0% of the initial concentration of atrazine after 24\xc2\xa0h. These results confirm gene dispersion and/or a possible contamination of the area with the herbicide, which reinforces global concern of the increase and intensive use of pesticides worldwide.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has resulted in the conversion of >230,000 km2 of tropical forest, yet little is known on the quantities of biomass consumed or the losses of nutrients from the ecosystem. We quantified the above-ground biomass, nutrient pools and the effects of biomass burning in four slashed primary tropical moist forests in the Brazilian Amazon. Total above-ground biomass (TAGB) ranged from 292 Mg ha-1 to 436 Mg ha-1. Coarse wood debris (>20.5 cm diameter) was the dominant fuel component. However, structure of the four sites were variable. Coarse wood debris comprised from 44% to 69% of the TAGB, while the forest floor (litter and rootmat) comprised from 3.7 to 8.0% of the TAGB. Total biomass consumption ranged from 42% to 57%. Fires resulted in the consumption of >99% of the litter and rootmat, yet <50% of the coarse wood debirs. Dramatic losses in C, N, and S were quantified. Lesser quantities of P, K, and Ca were lost by combustion processes. Carbon losses from the ecosystem were 58\xe2\x80\x93112 Mg ha-1. Nitrogen losses ranged from 817 to 1605 kg ha-1 and S losses ranged from 92 to 122 kg ha-1. This represents losses that are as high as 56%, 68%, and 49% of the total above-ground pools of these nutrients, respectively. Losses of P were as high as 20 kg ha-1 or 32% of the above-ground pool. Losses to the atmosphere arising from primary slash fires were variable among sites due to site differences in concentration, fuel biomass, and fuel structure, climatic fluctuations, and anthropogenic influences. Compared to fires in other forest ecosystems, fires in slashed primary tropical evergreen forests result in among the highest total losses of nutrients ever measured. In addition, the proportion of the total nutrient pool lost from slash fires is higher in this ecosystem compared to other ecosystems due to a higher percentage of nutrients stored in above-ground biomass.'

Abstract: 'The composition of the ant community was assessed along standardized 100 m transects in annually flooded Varzea forest and in terra firme forests on sandy soil (Flanco forest) and on claytopped mesas (Planalto forest). Standardized samples were taken by unit-time hand collecting (day and night times), sweeping, beating, baiting and by Winkler sacks. A total of 156 species, representing 49 genera were found, of which 98, 88 and 55 were respectively found in the Planalto, Flanco and Varzea forests. Species lists are presented and the ant community composition and species richness are compared between the three forests. By considering the nesting and foraging habits of the various species, the differences in overall community composition are related to the forest type and susceptibility to inundation of the three forests which were surveyed.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we investigated the effects of the partial conversion of native Amazon savanna into a eucalyptus plantation on the richness, composition, and abundance of medium and large mammals. Considering these plantations as an integral component of a patchwork savanna landscape, we verified how the negative effects of these plantations can be buffered by the conservation of remnants of native habitat within their area. We analyzed the contribution of each type of Amazonian savanna to the maintenance of the mammalian fauna and the potential of eucalyptus plantations to substitute these native habitats. A total of 23 mammal species were recorded in line-transect surveys conducted within the conserved savanna. By contrast, only eight species were recorded in the eucalyptus plantation and none of them were exclusive to this vegetation. However, the landscape patchwork formed by plantations and savanna was more diverse and contained 19 species of mammals, highlighting the potential importance of remnant savanna vegetation. The maintenance of remnants of savanna habitat may thus be essential for ensuring the conservation of mammals in the anthropogenic landscape of this region. It will also be important to include as many different subtypes of native savanna vegetation as possible and to consider the connectivity between habitats.'

Abstract: 'Over the past decades, the tropical mountain rainforest of southern Ecuador has been threatened by conversion to cattle pastures. Frequently, these pastures are invaded by bracken fern and abandoned when bracken becomes dominant. Changes in land-use (forest\xe2\x80\x93pasture\xe2\x80\x93abandoned pasture) can affect soil microorganisms and their physiological responses with respect to soil carbon and nutrient cycling. In situ investigations on litter decomposition and soil respiration as well as biogeochemical characterization of the soil were carried out to identify the driving factors behind. The conversion of forest to pasture induced a pronounced increase in CO2\xe2\x80\x93C effluxes to 12.2\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0a\xe2\x88\x921 which did not decrease after abandonment. Soil microbial activity and biomass showed a different pattern with lowest values at forest and abandoned pasture sites. With 3445\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 (0\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0cm) microbial biomass carbon (MBC by CFE-method), the active pasture had a more than three times higher value than forest and abandoned pasture, which was among the highest in tropical pasture soils. A shift in the microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acid, PLFA) was also induced by the establishment of pasture land; the relative abundance of fungi and Gram-negative bacteria increased. PLFA fingerprints of the forest organic layer were more similar to pasture than to forest mineral soil. Chemical properties (pH value, exchangeable cations) were the main factors influencing the respective microbial structure. Bracken-invasion resulted in a decrease in the quantity and quality of above- and belowground biomass. The lower organic substance and nutrient availability induced a significant decline in microbial biomass and activity. After pasture abandonment, these differences in soil microbial function were not accompanied by pronounced shifts in the community structure and in soil pH as was shown for the conversion to pasture. A disconnection between microbial structure and function was identified. Similar soil CO2\xe2\x80\x93C effluxes between active and abandoned pasture sites might be explained by an underestimation of the effluxes from the active pasture site. All measurements were carried out between grass tussocks where fine-root density was about 2.6 times lower than below tussocks. Thus, lower proportions of root respiration were expected than below tussocks. Overall, soil microorganisms responded differently to changes in land-use from forest to pasture and from pasture to abandoned pasture resulting in pronounced changes of carbon and nutrient cycling and hence of ecosystem functioning.'

Abstract: 'Carbon emissions from fluvial systems are a key component of local and regional carbon cycles. We used floating chambers to investigate the CO2 flux from stream water to air (\\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\)) in the Arboleda, a stream in the lowland rainforest of Costa Rica, fed partly by old regional groundwater high in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Drifting and static chambers showed \\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\) averaging 35.5 and 72.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol C m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921, respectively, bracketing the previously-published \\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\) value of 56\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol C m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 obtained using tracer methods in this stream. These values are much higher than most \\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\) data in the literature and reflect a large flux of deep crustal (non-biogenic) CO2 out of the Arboleda, a flux that does not represent a component of ecosystem respiration. Static chambers appeared to overestimate \\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\) by creating artificial turbulence, while drifting chambers may have underestimated \\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\) by under-sampling areas of potentially high gas exchange (e.g., riffles around coarse woody debris obstructions). Both static and drifting chambers revealed high spatial heterogeneity in \\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\) at the scale of 5\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0m reaches. Some observed temporal trends were localized, e.g., among three reaches with repeated measurements through the wet and dry seasons, (1) only the reach located between the other two showed significantly lower \\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\) during the dry season, and (2) the highest and lowest \\({\\text{f}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}\\) were consistently observed in the reaches farthest upstream and downstream, respectively. Streams like the Arboleda receiving significant inputs of high-DIC regional groundwater merit additional study as hotspots for C emissions from terrestrial ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Bulk precipitation and throughfall were collected in a wet lowland rainforest in SW Costa Rica on an event basis to allow modelling the contributions of dry deposition and canopy exchange to nutrient inputs and internal cycling of nutrients. Estimates based on bulk precipitation underestimated total atmospheric deposition to tropical rainforests by up to 10-fold ignoring the contributions of dry deposition. Canopy exchange contributed most of the aboveground inputs to the forest soil of Na+, about half for K+, 10% for P and Mg2+ and negligible for N, C and other elements. Tree species composition did not account for the differences found in net throughfall between forest sites, and vegetation structure (plant area index) had only a small effect on net throughfall. Forest regrowth affected net throughfall through reduced soil fertility and differences in leaf traits. Topography most significantly affected net throughfall via increased dry deposition at sites of higher elevation and via soil fertility and increased canopy exchange at down slope sites.'

Abstract: 'The tree changes of 1.02\xc2\xa0ha of montane forest at the Santa L\xc3\xbacia Biological Station, southeastern Brazil, were analyzed using two surveys separated by an interval of 11\xc2\xa0years with the aim of confirming the patterns of stability of structure and diversity over time. In the original survey all trees with diameter at breast height \xe2\x89\xa56.4\xc2\xa0cm were sampled. In second survey (this study), dead trees, survivors and recruits in the same forest were reported. The data suggest a dynamic balance of the forest structure because mortality (\xe2\x88\x921.06% year\xe2\x88\x921 for number of trees and \xe2\x88\x920.85% year\xe2\x88\x921 for basal area) was very close to recruitment (0.89% year\xe2\x88\x921) and ingrowth (1.05% year\xe2\x88\x921). The high diversity of the original survey (H\xe2\x80\xb2\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa05.2) was maintained by the turnover species. The main tree populations also showed stability of number of trees and basal area. This pattern was shared by most of the 28 local endemic species, ensuring the maintenance of their populations in the plot.'

Abstract: '\nGlobal change phenomena, such as forest disturbance and land-use change, significantly affect elemental balances as well as the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the importance of shifts in soil nutrient stoichiometry for the regulation of belowground biota and soil food webs have not been intensively studied for tropical ecosystems. In the present account, we examine the effects of land-use change and soil depth on soil and microbial stoichiometry along a land-use sequence (natural forest, pastures of different ages, secondary succession) in the tropical mountain rainforest region of southern Ecuador. Furthermore, we analyzed (PLFA-method) whether shifts in the microbial community structure were related to alterations in soil and microbial stoichiometry. Soil and microbial stoichiometry were affected by both land-use change and soil depth. After forest disturbance, significant decreases of soil C:N:P ratios at the pastures were followed by increases during secondary succession. Microbial C:N ratios varied slightly in response to land-use change, whereas no fixed microbial C:P and N:P ratios were observed. Shifts in microbial community composition were associated with soil and microbial stoichiometry. Strong positive relationships between PLFA-markers 18:2n6,9c (saprotrophic fungi) and 20:4 (animals) and negative associations between 20:4 and microbial N:P point to land-use change affecting the structure of soil food webs. Significant deviations from global soil and microbial C:N:P ratios indicated a major force of land-use change to alter stoichiometric relationships and to structure biological systems. Our results support the idea that soil biotic communities are stoichiometrically flexible in order to adapt to alterations in resource stoichiometry.'

Abstract: "In the Brazilian Amazon during the 1980s,urban population growth outstripped rural growth, andby 1991, most of the region's population resided inurban areas. Much of this urban growth involvedestablishment of unplanned housing with inadequateinfrastructure, which resulted in rising pollution. This paper compares indicators of environmentalquality in urban populations of the Amazon in 1980 and1991, and among different kinds of urban populationsin 1991. The results show that environmental qualityin the region deteriorated during the 1980s as theproduction of and exposure to environmental hazardsrose while resources to ward off hazards eroded. Thefindings also show that environmental quality wasparticularly poor in more rapidly growing urbancenters. The urban Amazon may not afford an adequatestandard of living and this may generate out-migrationfrom the region."

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Amazon is an area of both serious environmental degradation and social instability. Despite billions of dollars spent on economic development and the rapid pace of urbanization, deforestation is extreme and violent land conflict is intense. Although episodes of conflict over land are common in Brazilian history, this paper focuses on agrarian issues that arose with the opening of the Amazon frontier in the 1970s. The paper argues that the nature of land conflict in the eastern Brazilian Amazon is dynamic, and proposes a two-stage model to illustrate how the struggle has evolved from an agrarian phenomenon to an organized resistance that is urban-based. Recognizing the interaction between cities and rural areas in the frontier reaches of the Brazilian Amazon is key to understanding the land struggle in the face of urbanization. The analytical framework deployed considers the transformation of the region from an agrarian frontier to an urbanized frontier, assessing the dynamic nature of the land struggle and examining the implications for land cover change.'

Abstract: 'Strong changes of temperature and rainfall effected tropical South America during the last few millions of years; the sequence of the last glacialinterglacial cycle is relatively well known. Humid and cooler climates occurred in the period between >50 000 and approx. 25 000/30 000 B.P. A cold and very dry climate occurred in the period of approx. 21 000-14 000 B.P. Between 13 000 and 10 000 the climate became warmer and more humid, and from 10 000 B.P. to the present, the climate is more like the present, but there are still changes of temperature and especially rainfall. The climatic changes had a profound effect on the vegetation, especially in the mountains, but data from the tropical lowlands are now increasing and show that the effect on lowland vegetation may also have been considerable. Very recent data from Eastern Brasil (Carajas, see postscriptum) indicate that the rainfall in that area was lowered at least 500 mm during several dry phases of the Late Pleistocene, savanna vegetation replacing forest. If this lowering of rainfall was a regional phenomenon, the Amazonian forest may have been split up in at least two large forest areas separated by savanna and/or dry forest.'

Abstract: 'Our estimates indicate that about 30% of the seven million square kilometers that make up the Amazon basin comply with international criteria for wetland definition. Most countries sharing the Amazon basin have signed the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance but still lack complete wetland inventories, classification systems, and management plans. Amazonian wetlands vary considerably with respect to hydrology, water and soil fertility, vegetation cover, diversity of plant and animal species, and primary and secondary productivity. They also play important roles in the hydrology and biogeochemical cycles of the basin. Here, we propose a classification system for large Amazonian wetland types based on climatic, hydrological, hydrochemical, and botanical parameters. The classification scheme divides natural wetlands into one group with rather stable water levels and another with oscillating water levels. These groups are subdivided into 14 major wetland types. The types are characterized and their distributions and extents are mapped.'

Abstract: 'Bana, or Low Amazon Caatinga is an evergreen sclerophyllous woodland. It occurs on bleached quartz sands in the lowlands of SW Venezuela, where it occupies relatively small \xe2\x80\x98islands\xe2\x80\x99 amidst Tall Amazon Caatinga which is exclusively developed on tropaquods.'

Abstract: 'Oleoresin extracted from copaiba (Copaifera spp.: Leguminosae) trees is a popular traditional medicine in Amazonia. I studied production ecology from three copaiba types in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Mean oleoresin yield from the first harvest was 0.07 liters per tree for all trees drilled and 0.23 liters per tree for ones yielding some oleoresin. Yields were comparable toC. multijuga results in central Amazonia but lower than anecdotal reports of 2 liters or more per tree. Yield differences were minor between tree types and seasons. Yield peaked in mid-size trees (45-65 cm DBH) while small (45 cm DBH), very large (>65 cm DBH), and hollow trees (due to senescence or fire) yielded negligible amounts. Oleoresin was harvested almost exclusively from inner heartwood, indicating that factors stimulating its synthesis in cambium are probably distinct from factors that promote its storage in heartwood and loss of yield many years later.'

Abstract: "In the Brazilian Amazon mass deforestation has resulted from a sequenceof road building, extractive logging, and pasture development during the pastthree decades. Ranchers have consolidated small agricultural holdings, pushingfarmers to move to forest frontiers or urban fringes, prompting furtherdeforestation and social instability. In response to this conversion ofAmazonian forests, the authors sought to identify both economically viable andmore sustainable development alternatives within the Brazilian state ofPar\xc3\xa1. There, local farmers of Japanese descent have developed a varietyof agroforestry systems in which 10 to 20 hectare (ha) fields yieldincomes comparable to 400 to 1,200 ha pastures. In addition, suchcrop fields generate substantially more rural employment per hathan do pastures. Ongoing forest conversion to pasture is clearly not a productof sound economic decision making. Improved land zoning and public policiescould favor agroforestry over further pasture expansion, stabilizing ruralpopulations while helping to conserve the Amazon's remaining forests."

Abstract: 'Understanding tropical forest diversity is a long-standing challenge in ecology. With global change, it has become increasingly important to understand how anthropogenic and natural factors interact to determine diversity. Anthropogenic increases in fire frequency are among the global change variables affecting forest diversity and functioning, and seasonally dry forest of the southern Amazon is among the ecosystems most affected by such pressures. Studying how fire will impact forests in this region is therefore important for understanding ecosystem functioning and for designing effective conservation action. We report the results of an experiment in which we manipulated fire, nutrient availability, and herbivory. We measured the effects of these interacting factors on the regenerative capacity of the ecotone between humid Amazon forest and Brazilian savanna. Regeneration density, diversity, and community composition were severely altered by fire. Additions of P and N\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0P reduced losses of density and richness in the first year post-fire. Herbivory was most important just after germination. Diversity was positively correlated with herbivory in unburned forest, likely because fire reduced the number of reproductive individuals. This contrasts with earlier results from the same study system in which herbivory was related to increased diversity after fire. We documented a significant effect of fire frequency; diversity in triennially burned forest was more similar to that in unburned than in annually burned forest, and the community composition of triennially burned forest was intermediate between unburned and annually burned areas. Preventing frequent fires will therefore help reduce losses in diversity in the southern Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s matrix of human-altered landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Since the 1970s, migration to the Amazon has led to a growing human presence and resulting dramatic changes in the physical landscape of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon frontier, including considerable deforestation. Over time, a second demographic phenomenon has emerged with the children of the original migrants leaving settler farms to set out on their own. The vast majority have remained in the Amazon region, some contributing to further changes in land use via rural\xe2\x80\x93rural migration to establish new farms and others to incipient urbanization. This paper uses longitudinal, multi-scale data on settler colonists between 1990 and 1999 to analyze rural\xe2\x80\x93rural and rural\xe2\x80\x93urban migration among second-generation colonists within the region. Following a description of migrants and settlers in terms of their individual, household and community characteristics, a multinomial discrete-time hazard model is used to estimate the determinants of out-migration of the second generation settlers to both urban and rural areas. We find significant differences in the determinants of migration to the two types of destinations in personal characteristics, human capital endowments, stage of farm and household lifecycles, migration networks, and access to community resources and infrastructure. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications of migrants\xe2\x80\x99 choice of rural versus urban destinations.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation in the Amazon and the social vulnerability of its settler communities has been associated with increased malaria incidence. The feeding biology of the most important malaria vectors in the region, notably Nyssorhynchus darlingi, compounds efforts to control vectors and reduce transmission of what has become known as \xe2\x80\x9cFrontier Malaria\xe2\x80\x9d. Exploring Anophelinae mosquito diversity is fundamental to understanding the species responsible for transmission and developing appropriate management and intervention strategies for malaria control in the Amazon River basin.'

Abstract: 'Quantifying and mapping ecosystem services (ES) is seen as one way to improve decision making and land management to better integrate environmental issues. This study aimed to characterize ES supply in deforestation context where an improvement of scientific knowledge should help develop more efficient environmental management. For three case studies in the Brazilian Amazon impacted by deforestation, seven indicators of potential ES supply were mapped at a spatial resolution of 30\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa030\xc2\xa0m: biodiversity index (indicator of food web support); richness of pollinators (pollination); index of soil chemical quality (support to production); water available for plants (water regulation); soil carbon stocks (support to production and climate regulation); rate of water infiltration into the soil (soil erosion control); and vegetation carbon stocks (climate regulation). To map these indicators, in situ measurements of ES for 135 sampling points and remote sensing data were linked using regression methods. These methods were used to predict ES values and identify environmental factors that influence ES supply. The resulting maps help in understanding the influence of environmental factors on ES spatial distribution within the sites. The analyses illustrate the influence of land-use changes on ES supply and the role of context effects due to the heterogeneity of the biophysical environment, the temporality of deforestation and/or their diversified sociopolitical contexts. From a methodological viewpoint, the study highlights the importance of choices inherent in all cartographic practices and that need to be considered, especially in the context of rendering ES maps operational.'

Abstract: "This paper examines the recent development of the a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad fruit economy in regional Amazonian urban markets (as a staple food) and more recently among national and international consumers (as a fashion food) and the consequences for agroforestry intensification by Caboclo communities in the Amazon estuary. The paper is based on long-term ethnographic research and field experiments; the a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad fruit economy is discussed from agricultural, social, and economic perspectives; attention is given to its historical development, the structure of a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad fruit production, its agents, the relationship among themselves and the urban market. Decadal price performance is presented for a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad fruit and a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad transportation costs and compared to major agropastoral products for the Eastern Amazon region. Dominant views about the \xe2\x80\x98economic rationality\xe2\x80\x99 of rural producers' decision-making are discussed. A\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad fruit has performed as well as and in some cases surpassed most agro-pastoral products of the Northern region. Economic returns for producers reflect linkages between price signals from urban markets, harvesting decision, and land tenure condition of the producer. Urban markets for the fruit is expanding and bringing new participants to the a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad fruit economy further conditioning the ability of rural producers to take advantage of external markets for forest products. Discussion of factors conditioning agricultural development and integration between urban and rural areas conclude the article."

Abstract: 'Tropical deforestation is a major contributor to green house gas emissions in developing countries. Incentive mechanisms, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), are currently being considered as a possible emissions reduction and offset solution. Although REDD has expanded its scope to include co-benefits such as sustainable management of forests and biodiversity conservation (known as REDD+), current carbon-base methodologies do not specifically target projects for the parallel protection of these co-benefits. This study demonstrates the incorporation of both carbon and biodiversity benefits within REDD+\xc2\xa0in the Bolivian Amazon, through the analysis of land cover change and future change scenario modeling to the year 2050. Current protected areas within the Bolivian Amazon were evaluated for REDD+\xc2\xa0project potential by identifying concordant patterns of carbon content, species biodiversity and deforestation vulnerability. Biodiversity-based versus carbon-based protection schemes were evaluated and protected areas were prioritized using irreplaceability-vulnerability plots. Deforestation projection scenarios to the year 2050 varied depending on the historical period analyzed, producing low, intermediate and high deforestation scenarios. All scenarios showed increasing deforestation pressure in the northern region of Bolivia along with high levels of biodiversity loss. Expected reductions in the carbon pool ranged from 8 to 48%, for the low and high demand scenarios respectively. Some protected areas presented large numbers of endemic species, high concentrations of carbon and high deforestation vulnerability, demonstrating the potential for win\xe2\x80\x93win REDD+\xc2\xa0projects in Bolivia.'

Abstract: 'Hydraulic redistribution (HR), the nocturnal transport of moisture by plant roots from wetter to drier portions of the root zone, in general can buffer plants against seasonal water deficits. However, its role in longer droughts and its long-term ecological impact are not well understood. Based on numerical model experiments for the Amazon forest, this modeling study indicates that the impact of HR on plant growth differs between droughts of different time scales. While HR increases transpiration and plant growth during regular dry seasons, it reduces dry season transpiration and net primary productivity (NPP) under extreme droughts such as those during El Ni\xc3\xb1o years in the Amazon forest. This occurs because, in places where soil water storage is not able to sustain the ecosystem through the dry season, the HR-induced acceleration of moisture depletion in the early stage of the dry season reduces water availability for the rest of the dry season and causes soil moisture to reach the wilting point earlier. This gets exacerbated during extreme droughts, which jeopardizes the growth of trees that are not in dry season dormancy, i.e., evergreen trees. As a result, the combination of drought and HR increases the percentage of drought deciduous trees at the expense of evergreen trees, and the fractional coverage of forest canopy is characterized by sudden drops following extreme droughts and slow recovery afterwards. The shift of the tropical forest towards more drought deciduous trees as a result of the combined effects of extreme drought and HR has important implications for how vegetation will respond to future climate changes.'

Abstract: 'Despite an abundant literature exploring the relationship between population growth and forest cover change, comparatively little research has examined the forest cover impacts of family planning use\xe2\x80\x94a key determinant of population growth rates in many developing countries. Using data from a panel survey of farms in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon, this paper explores whether family planning use affects changes in forest cover. After controlling for household life cycle effects, family planning use among female heads of farm households did not have an independent effect on deforestation, reforestation, or net forest loss between 1990 and 2008. Rather, shorter-term drivers of forest change tend to be associated with household life cycles and shifts in production and consumption. However, family planning will continue to improve development and health outcomes for women by reducing unwanted fertility and may offer longer-term environmental benefits.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation and forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon are a regional-scale anthropogenic process related to biomass burning, which has a direct impact on global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. Containment of this process requires characterizing its spatial distribution and that of the environmental factors related to its occurrence. The aim of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of deforested areas and forest fires in the State of Roraima from 2000 to 2010. We mapped deforested areas and forest fires using Landsat images and associated their occurrence with two phytoclimatic zones: zone with savanna influence (ZIS), and zone without savanna influence (ZOS). Total deforested area during the interval was estimated at 3.06\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0103 km2 (ZIS\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa055\xc2\xa0%; ZOS\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa045\xc2\xa0%) while total area affected by forest fires was estimated at 3.02\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0103 km2 (ZIS\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa097.7\xc2\xa0%; ZOS\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02.3\xc2\xa0%). Magnitude of deforestation in Roraima was not related to the phytoclimatic zones, but small deforested areas (\xe2\x89\xa417.9\xc2\xa0ha) predominated in ZOS while larger deforestation classes (>17.9\xc2\xa0ha) predominated in ZIS, which is an area with a longer history of human activities. The largest occurrence of forest fires was observed in the ZIS in years with El Ni\xc3\xb1o events. Our analysis indicates that the areas most affected by forest fires in Roraima during 2000\xe2\x80\x932010 were associated with strong climatic events and the occurrence these fires was amplified in ZIS, a sensitive phytoclimatic zone with a higher risk of anthropogenic fires given its drier climate and open forest structure.'

Abstract: 'Despite the strong representativeness of streams in the Amazon basin, their role in the accumulation of coarse particulate organic carbon (CPOC), fine particulate organic carbon (FPOC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in transport, an important energy source in these environments, is poorly known. It is known that the arboreal vegetation in the Amazon basin is influenced by soil fertility and rainfall gradients, but would these gradients promote local differences in organic matter in headwater streams? To answer this question, 14 low-order streams were selected within these gradients along the Amazon basin, with extensions that varied between 4 and 8\xc2\xa0km. The efficiency of the transformation of particulate into dissolved carbon fractions was assessed for each stream. The mean monthly benthic organic matter storage ranged between 1.58 and 9.40\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0month\xe2\x88\x921. In all locations, CPOC was the most abundant fraction in biomass, followed by FPOC and DOC. Rainfall and soil fertility influenced the distribution of the C fraction (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01), showing differentiated particulate organic carbon (POC) storage and DOC transportation along the basin. Furthermore, the results revealed that carbon quantification at the basin level could be underestimated, ultimately influencing the global carbon calculations for the region. This is especially due to the fact that the majority of studies consider only fine particulate organic matter and dissolved organic matter, which represent less than 50\xc2\xa0% of the stored and transported carbon in streambeds.'

Abstract: 'Local, regional, and global processes affect deforestation and land-use changes in the Brazilian Amazon. Characteristics are: direct conversions from forest to pasture; regional processes of indirect land-use change, described by the conversion of pastures to cropland, which increases the demand for pastures elsewhere; and teleconnections, fueled by the global demands for soybeans as animal fodder. We modeled land-use changes for two scenarios Trend and Sustainable Development for a hot spot of land-use change along the BR-163 highway in Mato Grosso and Par\xc3\xa1, Brazil. We investigated the differences between a coupled modeling approach, which incorporates indirect land-use change processes, and a noncoupled land-use model. We coupled the regional-scale LandSHIFT model, defined for Mato Grosso and Par\xc3\xa1, with a subregional model, alucR, covering a selected corridor along the BR-163. The results indicated distinct land-use scenario outcomes from the coupled modeling approach and the subregional model quantification. We found the highest deforestation estimates returned from the subregional quantification of the Trend scenario. This originated from the strong local dynamics of past deforestation and land-use changes. Land-use changes exceeded the demands estimated at regional scale. We observed the lowest deforestation estimates at the subregional quantification of the Sustainable Development story line. We highlight that model coupling increased the representation of scenario outcomes at fine resolution while providing consistency across scales. However, distinct local dynamics were explicitly captured at subregional scale. The scenario result pinpoints the importance of policies to aim at the cattle ranching sector, to increase land tenure registration and enforcement of environmental laws.'

Abstract: 'Due to the advancing agricultural frontier in the Brazilian Amazon, the present rate of deforestation engenders a pessimistic scenario for vertebrate diversity in the area. Protected areas are an essential conservation tool to limit biodiversity loss, but their efficiency have yet to be proven. Here, we used camera-trap data on the presence of medium and large-size vertebrates in a protected area (Cant\xc3\xa3o State Park) and a neighbouring private forest reserve (Santa F\xc3\xa9 Ranch) to evaluate their effectiveness in protecting biodiversity. We also gathered information on seasonality and activity patterns. A total sampling effort of 7929 trap-nights revealed a diverse vertebrate fauna in the region. A total of 34 mammal species, belonging to 8 different orders was detected in the study area, some of which have a high level of conservation interest and value. The photographic index showed that diversity was more abundant outside the protected area of Cant\xc3\xa3o State Park, where seasonality could play a major role in vertebrate occurrence. Overall, the influence of seasonality on distribution appears to be species-specific. During the wet season around 40% of the common species were not detected inside the park, whereas in Santa F\xc3\xa9 Ranch most species (62.5%) suffered only a slight decrease in relative abundance probably due to changes in the availability of food resources. Our results highlight the importance of private land for vertebrate conservation in the Amazon and alert to the need for increased law enforcement in these areas to secure biodiversity preservation.'

Abstract: 'Samples of corbicular and stored pollen gathered by Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille, 1811) in an Amazon-Chiquitano transitional forest during the dry season were analyzed. The pollen spectrum was established as well as the dynamics of the relationship between the stingless bee and the surrounding flora. Pollen samples obtained from three rational hives were subjected to acetolysis and 55 pollen types were identified, the most frequent being from Anadenanthera (Fabaceae), Chenopodiaceae, and Dydimopanax (Araliaceae). Significant differences in pollen families used between hives along the months of collection were found in stored pollen and non-significant differences in corbicular pollen. Mean values of alpha diversity (H\xe2\x80\xb2) showed T. angustula as a generalist while beta diversity qualitatively showed that pollen composition was similar between two hives both of which differed from the third hive. Pollen types in corbicular and stored pollen were in general related with richness of flowering plants in the foraging area; the pollen offer was less diverse than the pollen collected, and a trend to prefer the collection of pollen from the most abundant flowering species could be discerned. T. angustula showed polylectic feeding habits and a capacity to adapt to food availability.'

Abstract: 'Brazil possesses a long history of violent struggle for land, and its most recent phase is occurring predominantly in the Amazon Basin. Consequently, this paper attempts to territorialize land conflict in the Brazilian Amazon, and in so doing, to illuminate the place-specific intersection of historic social, political, and economic circumstance that created a violent landscape in the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cSouth of Par\xc3\xa1.\xe2\x80\x9d The paper\xe2\x80\x99s premise is that such conflict can be best viewed as resulting from a dialectic between general social processes operating across spatial scales, which create necessary conditions for conflict, and place-specific historical circumstances that transform necessary into sufficient conditions. The paper presents a framework integrating the theory of contentious politics and literatures addressing violence associated with the Amazonian frontier and with resource scarcity (and abundance). The discussion and theoretical application deconstruct the environmental, cognitive, and relational mechanisms that created violence in the South of Par\xc3\xa1, and set the stage for the Eldorado dos Caraj\xc3\xa1s massacre in April of 1996.'

Abstract: 'The Medium Solim\xc3\xb5es River region in the Brazilian Amazon Basin is an area utilized for reproduction and nesting by a variety of species of migratory aquatic birds such as Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger). These migratory birds form mixed-species reproductive colonies with high population densities and exhibit a large range of migration routes. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and diversity of the avian malaria parasites Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in Black Skimmers, on the basis of the association between microscopic observation of blood smears and amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mtDNA cyt-b). The overall prevalence rates of the parasites for juvenile and adult bird specimens were 16\xc2\xa0% (5/31) and 22\xc2\xa0% (15/68), respectively. Sequencing the mtDNA cyt-b marker revealed two Plasmodium lineages, which had been previously described in different regions of the American continent, including a Neotropical region in Southeast Brazil, and one Haemoproteus lineage. The fact that avian malarial parasites have been found infecting the Black Skimmers in the Brazilian Amazon ecosystem, which exhibits considerable diversity, highlights the importance of these migratory birds as a potential source of infection and dispersion of pathogens to other susceptible birds of the Nearctic and Neotropical regions.'

Abstract: 'Land reclamation in the humid tropics, using native tree plantations, requires a better knowledge of plant-soil interactions, and of patterns of growth of several poorly known species. We examined the establishment and mineral nutrition of two early-successional native tree species, Inga densiflora (N-fixing) and Pollalesta discolor, in relation to properties of a degraded Hydrandept volcanic soil in Ecuadorian Amazon. Initial content of organic matter was the most significant soil variable in explaining the growth of pure stands of both species and was strongly related to effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) and to net total N mineralization. Leaves of Pollalesta discolor had greater concentration of nutrients than Inga densiflora, which led to a litter-layer rich in nutrients. Deficient concentrations of foliar P, detected on plots with low soil organic matter, were linked to poor growth of Inga densiflora, and indicate that this species may be P-limited. The inclusion of Inga densiflora did not stimulate the growth of Pollalesta discolor in mixed stands. This study indicates that soil organic matter management is an important issue on these degraded volcanic soils. We suggest that a reduction of the pool of labile organic matter appears to hamper tree productivity through a nutrient shortage. The high variability of the degraded soil studied proved to be an obstacle to tree growth and establishment.'

Abstract: "We examined numbers of plant species and individuals relative to land use in an agricultural settlement in the Brazilian Amazon. Land uses were forest, cropped after forest, fallows, cropped after fallow, and pasture. These corresponded roughly to farmers' land-use changes over time. Numbers of species and diversity indices were generally highest in forest, but we found quite similar values in older fallows as a result of both survival/re-establishment of forest species and emergence of plants not encountered in forest. The dominant species in fallows, however, were different from those in forest. Lands cropped using slash-and-burn maintained moderate numbers of species\xe2\x80\x93both forest and non-forest. Trends in plant density (individuals per unit ground area) on cropped lands were mainly related to invasion of weedy species (increasing in time after slash-and-burn) and shifts in crop species (replacement of small-sized rice by larger-sized maize and cassava). Useful forest plants (e.g. for construction purposes, food and medicines) decreased with land conversion, although new species also appeared. The fewest species, tree species, and useful plants, and the greatest losses of the forest flora, were encountered in pastures. Consequently, conversion to pasture rather than slash-and-burn agriculture per se led to high biodiversity loss."

Abstract: 'Mining activities cause a wide range of changes to the environment, substantially affecting both the physical and biological environmental sectors. In the Caraj\xc3\xa1s Mineral Province, located in the Amazon rainforest, environmental regulations tend to be more rigorous, due to the fragility of the environment in which large iron deposits are found. The characterization of the impact of mining on environment considers: the type and extent of the impact, the physical chemistry differences and similarities of the mineral deposits, the deposit size, the adopted mining process, and the environment (both natural and economic) in which the mining process was developed. Remote sensing technology is utilized in this study, in particular, the use of ortho-aerial photograph, and optical and radar images with distinct spatial resolution. These permit the elaboration in synoptic maps, multi-scale and dynamic, of the changes wrought upon the environment: deforestation, removal of vegetation cover, topographic surface and landscape alteration, and slope instabilities among others. In this aspect, determining the extent of influence of the mining activity is directly tied to the characterization of its impact on various natural systems at the observed scale, and not by simply defining a predetermined Euclidean distance. The results showed that remote sensing technology, optical and radar images, proved to be efficient in the study of environmental information and the areas of influence on the semi-regional and local scales in the Amazon forest.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82Significant gaps exist in the knowledge of tropical leaf spectra and the manner in which spectra change as leaves age in their natural environment. Leaf aging effects may be particularly important in tropical vegetation growing on nutrient poor soils, such as Amazon caatinga, a white sand community common in the Amazon Basin. Spectral changes observed in six caatinga dominants include decreased reflectance and transmittance and increased absorptance for epiphyll-coated older leaves. Near-infrared (NIR) changes were most significant. More detailed spectral and physical changes were studied in one dominant, Aldina heterophylla. Over 16 months, Aldina study plants produced one or two leaf flushes. During leaf expansion, leaf water content and Specific Leaf Area decreased rapidly. Over the first 6 months spectral changes occurred across the spectrum, resulting in decreased transmittance and increased absorptance in the visible and NIR and decreased visible and increased NIR reflectance. In contrast, significant spectral changes were restricted to the NIR over the last 9 months, which showed a 10% absorptance increase associated primarily with increasing epiphylls and necrosis. At the canopy scale, increased NIR absorptance provides a mechanism for producing seasonally varying forest albedo and changing NIR to red ratios, independent of changes in other canopy attributes. In the Amazon caatinga studied, all canopy dominants were subject to epiphyllic growth providing a mechanism for distinguishing these forest types spectrally from more diverse terra-firme forest or forest types with more rapid leaf turnover, such as second growth. These changes are observable using remote sensing and could be used to map caatinga and monitor interannual or seasonal variability in phenology. If these results can be extended to other communities with long-lived foliage, they may offer a means for mapping vegetation on the basis of leaf longevity.'

Abstract: 'The concepts of phylogenetic community structure (PCS) and phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) allow ecologists to address the role of species\xe2\x80\x99 evolutionary history in community assembly. It is important to test the role of historical legacies relative to environmental constraints at local scales, where communities are assembled. We studied phylogenetic structure and niche conservatism for palms (Arecaceae) in the 64-km2 Ducke Reserve in the central Amazon, near Manaus. The 72 study plots, each covering 0.1\xc2\xa0ha, were distributed regularly in a terra firme forest along a hydro-edaphic gradient. We compared the observed palm PCS with assemblages generated by null models. We also analyzed whether morphological and ecological traits are labile or conserved along the phylogeny and quantified the spatial structure of morphological traits in each plot. We found an overall neutral PCS in combination with low PNC (labile traits), suggesting that evolutionary history poses little constraint on palm community assembly in this Amazonian landscape. Still, there was a tendency towards phylogenetic overdispersion in bottomlands, suggesting competitive exclusion among close relatives or, more likely, environmental filtering acting on convergent traits that affect co-occurrence in flood-prone areas. We conclude that (1) PCS of local communities is random as a whole and morphological traits are overall labile, but that (2) the hydro-edaphic gradient within terra firme forests leads to differences in species co-occurrence so that closely related species occur less often than expected in bottomlands due to diffuse competition among close relatives or environmental filtering on convergent traits.'

Abstract: 'Archaeology reports millenary cultural contacts between Peruvian Coast-Andes and the Amazon Yunga, a rainforest transitional region between Andes and Lower Amazonia. To clarify the relationships between cultural and biological evolution of these populations, in particular between Amazon Yungas and Andeans, we used DNA-sequence data, a model-based Bayesian approach and several statistical validations to infer a set of demographic parameters.'

Abstract: 'For over a hundred years shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn land preparation has been the predominant type of land use by smallholders in the Bragantina region of the Brazilian Eastern Amazon. This study contrasts the nutrient balance of slash-and-burn agriculture with a fire-free cultivation. Therefore, one half of a 3.5-year-old (28.7 t DM ha\xe2\x80\x931) and a 7-year-old woody fallow vegetation (46.5 t DM ha\xe2\x80\x931) was burnt and the other half mulched, leaving the biomass as a surface residue. Subsequently, a sequence of maize, beans and cassava was cropped for 1.5 year. Burning the 3.5- and 7-year-old fallow removed 97 and 94% of the C, 98 and 96% of the N, 90 and 63% of the P-stocks, and between 45 and 70% of the cations K, Mg and Ca of the aboveground biomass by volatilization or ash-particle transfer. These losses were avoided with the slash-and-mulch land preparation. Mulching did not increase the losses of nutrients by leaching, despite the high amount of rapidly decomposing surface mulch. Also the length of preceding fallow had no significant influence on leaching losses. At a depth of 3 m, leached nutrients were quantitatively negligible in both treatments. Comparing the nutrient fluxes at soil depths of 0.9 m, 1.8 m and 3 m, the amounts of all mobile nutrients, and also of chloride and sodium were markedly reduced during percolation and must have been retained. It is likely that nutrient retention in the subsoil layer is only temporary, emphasizing the need for a rapid re-establishment of the naturally deep-rooting secondary vegetation after abandonment of sites to enable uptake of these nutrients. The overall nutrient balance was highly negative for slash-and-burn. 291 and 403 kg N ha\xe2\x80\x931, 21 and 18 kg P ha\xe2\x80\x931, and 70 and 132 kg K ha\xe2\x80\x931 were removed from the burnt plots with a preceding fallow of 3.5 and 7 years, respectively. A reduced fallow period (3.5 years), which is a common trend in the region, resulted in a higher mean annual rate of nutrient loss averaged over the duration of the cycle than a fallow period of 7 years. Eliminating the burning losses by mulching brought the agricultural system back to an equilibrated or even slightly positive nutrient balance, even after a reduced fallow period. Thus, slash-and-mulch is a viable alternative to maintain agricultural productivity and ecosystem functioning.'

Abstract: 'During the dry season in Brazilian Amazon, the population experiences severe smoke haze pollution in a region called \xe2\x80\x9cArc of Devastation.\xe2\x80\x9d The increased pollution loading in the Amazonian atmosphere due to biomass burning emissions contributes significantly to global emissions of gases and particulate matter with important ecosystem and health impacts on local and regional populations. The aim of this study is to assess the lag structure among biomass burning air pollution exposure and environmental factors on children\xe2\x80\x99s health in the municipality of Rio Branco, southwestern region of the Brazilian Amazon. In this paper, Poisson regressions via transfer function models were used and compared to polynomial distributed lag models to analyze the lagged and cumulative impacts of fine particulate matter and humidity exposure on daily demand of children\xe2\x80\x99s hospital admissions due to respiratory causes from January 2004 to December 2009. Transfer function models presented better results. Increases of 10\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3 in particles \xe2\x89\xa4 2.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm/m3 aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) exposure were associated with 5.6\xc2\xa0% (95\xc2\xa0% CI, 3.64\xe2\x88\x927.31) increase in hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases at lag 2. Effects of PM2.5 were acute and slight \xe2\x80\x9charvesting\xe2\x80\x9d was found. Results demonstrate the adverse impact of biomass air pollution on health in the population, highlighting the need for public efforts to reduce this source of air pollution.'

Abstract: 'Processes operating at the terrestrial-lotic interface may significantly alter dissolved nitrogen concentrations in groundwater as a result of shifting redox conditions and microbial communities. We monitored concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen, NO 4 \xe2\x88\x92 , NH 4 \xe2\x88\x92 , O2 and Fe2+ for 10 months along two transects tracing groundwater flow from an upland (terra firme) forest, beneath the riparian forest, and into the stream channel of a small Central Amazonian catchment. Our aim was to examine the role of near-stream processes in regulating groundwater transfers of dissolved nitrogen from terrestrial to lotic ecosystems in the Central Amazon. We found pronounced compositional differences in inorganic nitrogen chemistry between upland, riparian, and stream hydrologic compartments. Nitrate dominated (average 89% of total inorganic nitrogen; TIN) the inorganic nitrogen chemistry of oxygenated upland groundwater but decreased markedly upon crossing the upland-riparian margin. Conversely, NH 4 \xe2\x88\x92  dominated (average 93% of TIN) the inorganic chemistry of apparently anoxic riparian groundwater; NH 4 \xe2\x88\x92 and TIN concentrations decreased markedly across the riparian-stream channel margin. In the oxygenated streamwater, NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  again dominated (average 82% of TIN) inorganic nitrogen chemistry. Denitrification followed by continued ammonification is hypothesized to effect the shift in speciation observed at the upland-riparian margin, while a combination of several processes may control the shift in speciation and loss of TIN observed at the riparian-stream margin. Dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations did not vary significantly between upland and riparian groundwater, but decreased across the riparian-stream margin. Our data suggest that extensive transformation reactions focused at the upland and stream margins of the riparian zone strongly regulate and diminish transfers of inorganic nitrogen from groundwater to streamwater in the catchment. This suggestion questions the veracity of attempts in the literature to link stream nitrogen chemistry with nutrient status in adjacent forests of similar catchments in the Central Amazon. It also complicates efforts to model nitrogen transfers across terrestrial-lotic interfaces in response to deforestation and changing climate.'

Abstract: 'Fallow periods used in slash-and-burn agriculture in the Bragantinaregion, the oldest agricultural frontier in the Brazilian Amazon, are beingreduced. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of a shortenedfallow period on the Bragantina landscape dynamics and equilibrium. Dynamicswere characterized by landscape structural changes, particularly in the spatialdistribution of secondary forests, and by transition matrix. Equilibrium wasdefined by temporal and spatial parameters, and by the increment ofagriculturalareas from 1985 to 1996, analyzed with 6 LANDSAT-TM images. I worked with 6areas of 250 ha each, 3 with short fallow periods (2\xe2\x80\x934years)and 3 with long fallow periods (about 10 years). Results showed that shortfallow period areas did not present an equilibrium situation. In these areas,developed secondary vegetation tended to disappear and agricultural areas werebeing expanded at an average rate of 3% per year. Landscape structure changespointed out that a reduction in fallow period was occurring in already shortfallow period areas. Long fallow period areas presented a shifting mosaicsteady-state condition, where punctual changes due to agricultural uses werecompensated by field abandonment rate. Both agricultural uses and fieldabandonment rates were lower in long fallow period areas when compared withshort ones. Comparisons with indigenous traditional cropping-fallow cyclesindicate that sustainable conditions could be maintained with 11 years offallowfor each cropping year, while shorter cycles would break down the system ifagricultural improvements are not implemented.'

Abstract: 'Natural rubber still has socioeconomic, environmental and technical importance, despite the production of several synthetic similar polymers in the last 70\xc2\xa0years. The Amazon Rainforest, the genetic base of Hevea brasiliensis, harbors a great diversity of ecosystems that can result in differentiated latex and elastomer molecules, from trees of the same species or other species and varieties of laticifer plants. Even so, there is little research to compare latex and rubber properties produced from native trees and planted clones. In this work, rubber latex was collected from four locations in the Amazon, including the historical places of Boim and Belterra and the most cultivated clone in Brazil, the RRIM 600, from a hevea plantation in the Center-West of Brazil. The following colloid properties were determined: pH, viscosity, particle size, dry rubber content, total solids content, gel content, total lipids, and total proteins. The molecular weight and the main physical and mechanical properties of the rubbers were also determined. Some main results can be highlighted: the rubber sample from Acre, in the extreme Western part of the Amazon, presented the highest molecular weight, while the Belterra sample, from remaining plantations of the Ford Project in Amazon, showed the highest values for mechanical properties. On the other hand, the technical characteristics of the RRIM 600 clone are close to the results obtained for the Boim sample, in Par\xc3\xa1, of the micro-region from where Henry Wickham collected the 70,000 seeds in 1876, from which the species was internationally domesticated. The present work is one of the very few studies to have been carried out with latex and rubber of these ancient rubber trees.'

Abstract: 'The Legal Brazilian Amazon, while the largest rainforest in the world, is also a region where most residents are urban. Despite close linkages between rural and urban processes in the region, rural areas have been the predominant focus of Amazon-based population-environment scholarship. Offering a focus on urban areas within the Brazilian Amazon, this paper examines the emergence of urban hierarchies within the region. Using a combination of nationally representative data and community based surveys, applied to a multivariate cluster methodology (Grade of Membership), we observe the emergence of sub-regional urban networks characterized by economic and political inter-dependency, population movement, and provision of services. These networks link rural areas, small towns, and medium and large cities. We also identify the emergence of medium-size cities as important nodes at a sub-regional level. In all, the work provides insight on the proposed model of \xe2\x80\x98disarticulated urbanization\xe2\x80\x99 within the Amazon by calling attention to the increasing role of regional and sub-regional urban networks in shaping the future expansion of land use and population distribution in the Amazon. We conclude with a discussion of implications for increasing intra-regional connectivity and fragmentation of conservation areas and ecosystems in the region.'

Abstract: "The investigation of crop and soil-crop conditions among Andoke and Witoto cultivators in southeast Colombia is used as a basis for assessing Geertz' (1963) model of swidden cultivation. In this respect, the extent to which maniocdominated swiddens in the study area \xe2\x80\x9csimulate\xe2\x80\x9d the structure and composition of the forest climax community is questioned. As Geertz (1963) indicates, an initial nutrient boost for crop cultivation results from the preliminary burning of forest debris, but weed competition, rather than progressive loss of soil fertility, is reported to be the primary cause of abandoning manioc cultivation after 2\xe2\x80\x933 years. While the Andoke and Witoto crop system remains adaptive at the individual field level, particularly in its constituent species, its fundamental adaptation is considered to be its integration into the broader \xe2\x80\x9cfield and fallow\xe2\x80\x9d system that juxtaposes crop production with extended periods of forest regeneration."

Abstract: 'The mahogany tree (Swietenia macrophylla King) is a species of conservation concern, mostly due to illegal and destructive harvesting practices. It has been planted in several agroforestry systems in the Brazilian Amazon to preserve the species and provide a sustainable source of this valuable timber. This study analyzed the growth and yield of the mahogany wood from plants used as shading in cocoa-based agroforestry systems with nitisols and red\xe2\x80\x93yellow acrisols, located in the State of Par\xc3\xa1, in the Brazilian Amazon, because these two types of soils are the most recommended for implanting cocoa-based agroforestry systems in the region due to their natural fertility. The installed experiment was a randomized 2\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x896 factorial experiment, with two types of soil and six different tree ages. The results indicate that soil type and plant age both affected the increments in diameter at breast height. Trees from the red\xe2\x80\x93yellow acrisol had statistically higher diameter at breast height values (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) than trees from the nitisol (40.05 and 33.57\xc2\xa0cm, respectively). There was also a significant interaction between soil type and tree age (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01). The average stem height differed markedly between the soil types from plants aged 19 and 22\xc2\xa0years (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05), whereas average stem height differed significantly among the 16-, 19-, and 22-year-old plants (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). The average wood volume was 1.41\xc2\xa0m3 tree\xe2\x88\x921, and the highest yield (1.75\xc2\xa0m3 tree\xe2\x88\x921) was achieved in the red\xe2\x80\x93yellow acrisol site, for 33-year-old trees. These results demonstrate how the cocoa and mahogany-based agroforestry systems can produce these products in a sustainable manner in the Brazilian Amazon.'

Abstract: 'Mixing zones between aquatic ecosystems are known diversity hot spots, but so far no study evaluated the effect of mixing waters on bacterial metabolism. Samplings were performed in four of the major Amazonian rivers, and aquatic bacterial production (BP) was measured both before the confluences and in the mixing zones downstream of the confluences. BP in mixing zones was higher than before the confluence in 75% of cases, representing an increase ranging from 31% to more than 1,000% of BP. In most of these cases, the confluence zone was formed by aquatic ecosystems that differed in the water type (environmental conditions and limiting nutrients to BP). The proportional contribution of the water from each source in the mixture had no impact on the outcome of BP in the mixtures, while BP in the mixtures peaked after 12\xc2\xa0h of mixing, indicating that the increase in BP can continue downstream from the confluence zone. Overall, the results presented here do not contradict the low aquatic bacterial metabolism suggested for most Amazonian waters, but show that this general pattern may be sprinkled with hot spot areas of high bacterial metabolism in the confluence of aquatic ecosystems.\n'

Abstract: 'Forests, through the regulation of regional water balances, provide a number of ecosystem services, including water for agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, industry, fisheries, and human consumption. Large-scale deforestation triggers complex non-linear interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere, which may impair such important ecosystem services. This is the case for the Southwestern Amazon, where three important river basins (Juru\xc3\xa1, Purus, and Madeira) are undergoing significant land-use changes. Here, we investigate the potential impacts of deforestation throughout the Amazon on the seasonal and annual water balances of these river basins using coupled climatic and hydrologic models under several deforestation scenarios. Simulations without climate response to deforestation show an increase in river discharge proportional to the area deforested in each basin, whereas those with climate response produce progressive reductions in mean annual precipitation over all three basins. In this case, deforestation decreases the mean annual discharge of the Juru\xc3\xa1 and Purus rivers, but increases that of the Madeira, because the deforestation-induced reduction in evapotranspiration is large enough to increase runoff and thus offset the reduction in precipitation. The effects of Amazon deforestation on river discharge are scale-dependent and vary across and within river basins. Reduction in precipitation due to deforestation is most severe at the end of the dry season. As a result, deforestation increases the dry-season length and the seasonal amplitude of water flow. These effects may aggravate the economic losses from large droughts and floods, such as those experienced in recent years (2005, 2010 and 2009, 2012, respectively).'

Abstract: 'Land use change is a global threat to soil quality and related ecosystem services. In Colombian Amazon, forest-cleared lands are predominantly covered by low-input and degraded pastures; but gradually, agroforestry systems (AFS) have been introduced as a sustainable alternative for soil reclamation and increasing land productivity. Although soil physical quality changes can be monitored by multiple indicators, the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method has emerged as a straightforward, reliable and low-cost tool for assessing and monitoring the impacts of land uses and management agricultural practices on soil quality in different parts of the world. However, the VESS has never been tested in AFS and in Colombian soils. Thus, we conducted a pioneering assessment of soil physical quality in six typical land uses (i.e., forest, pasture and four AFS) using the VESS method in northwestern Colombian Amazon. The VESS assessment takes account characteristics of soil aggregate and biological activity (roots and macrofauna) to assign scores ranging from Sq 1 (good) to Sq 5 (poor physical quality). Moreover, quantitative soil indicators (i.e., bulk density, soil resistance to penetration, soil moisture and soil organic C) were evaluated to correlate with VESS scores. Soil physical changes induced by land use change were efficiently detected by VESS scores. The VESS scores were significantly correlated with key indicators of soil quality. Conversion from Amazon forest to low-input pasture intensively degraded soil physical quality (overall Sq 1.3 vs Sq 4.0). Nevertheless, the adoption of AFS improves soil physical quality (overall Sq 3.2, 2.8, 2.4 and 2.2) in areas previously occupied with pasture, indicating greater potential of soil reclamation under more diversified systems. This study shows that adopting AFS can be a strategy for recovering soil quality and reincorporating degraded lands into productive and sustainable production systems in Amazon regions, and the VESS method can be an useful tool to monitoring soil physical changes in these areas.'

Abstract: 'Hydroelectric dams represent major investments and major sources of environmental and social impacts. Powerful forces surround the decision-making process on public investments in the various options for the generation and conservation of electricity. Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s proposed Belo Monte Dam (formerly Karara\xc3\xb4) and its upstream counterpart, the Altamira Dam (better known by its former name of Babaquara) are at the center of controversies on the decision-making process for major infrastructure projects in Amazonia. The Belo Monte Dam by itself would have a small reservoir area (440 km2) and large installed capacity (11, 181.3 MW), but the Altamira/Babaquara Dam that would regulate the flow of the Xingu River (thereby increasing power generation at Belo Monte) would flood a vast area (6140 km2). The great impact of dams provides a powerful reason for Brazil to reassess its current policies that allocate large amounts of energy in the country\xe2\x80\x99s national grid to subsidized aluminum smelting for export. The case of Belo Monte and the five additional dams planned upstream (including the Altamira/Babaquara Dam) indicate the need for Brazil to reform its environmental assessment and licensing system to include the impacts of multiple interdependent projects.'

Abstract: 'Soil fertility and leaching losses of nutrients were compared between a Fimic Anthrosol and a Xanthic Ferralsol from Central Amaz\xc3\xb4nia. The Anthrosol was a relict soil from pre-Columbian settlements with high organic C containing large proportions of black carbon. It was further tested whether charcoal additions among other organic and inorganic applications could produce similarly fertile soils as these archaeological Anthrosols. In the first experiment, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) was planted in pots, while in the second experiment lysimeters were used to quantify water and nutrient leaching from soil cropped to rice (Oryza sativa L.). The Anthrosol showed significantly higher P, Ca, Mn, and Zn availability than the Ferralsol increasing biomass production of both cowpea and rice by 38\xe2\x80\x9345% without fertilization (P<0.05). The soil N contents were also higher in the Anthrosol but the wide C-to-N ratios due to high soil C contents led to immobilization of N. Despite the generally high nutrient availability, nutrient leaching was minimal in the Anthrosol, providing an explanation for their sustainable fertility. However, when inorganic nutrients were applied to the Anthrosol, nutrient leaching exceeded the one found in the fertilized Ferralsol. Charcoal additions significantly increased plant growth and nutrition. While N availability in the Ferralsol decreased similar to the Anthrosol, uptake of P, K, Ca, Zn, and Cu by the plants increased with higher charcoal additions. Leaching of applied fertilizer N was significantly reduced by charcoal, and Ca and Mg leaching was delayed. In both the Ferralsol with added charcoal and the Anthrosol, nutrient availability was elevated with the exception of N while nutrient leaching was comparatively low.'

Abstract: 'The C4 grass Echinochloa polystachya, which forms dense and extensive monotypic stands on the Varzea floodplains of the Amazon region, provides the most productive natural higher plant communities known. The seasonal cycle of growth of this plant is closely linked to the annual rise and fall of water level over the floodplain surface. Diurnal cycles of leaf photosynthesis and transpiration were measured at monthly intervals, in parallel with measurements of leaf area index, canopy light interception and biomass. By artificial manipulation of the light flux incident on leaves in the field light-response curves of photosynthesis at the top and near to the base of the canopy were generated. Fitted light-response curves of CO2 uptake were combined with information of leaf area index, incident light and light penetration of the canopy to estimate canopy rates of photosynthesis. Throughout the period in which the floodplains were submerged photosynthetic rates of CO2 uptake (A) for the emergent leaves were high with a mean of c. 30 \xce\xbcmol m-2 s-1 at mid-day and occasional values of 40 \xce\xbcmol m-2 s-1. During the brief dry phase, when the floodplain surface is uncovered, there was a significant depression of A, with mid-day mean values of c. 17 \xce\xbcmol m-2 s-1. This corresponded with a c. 50% decrease in stomatal conductance, and a c. 35% depression in the ratio of the leaf inter-cellular to external CO2 concentration (ci/ca). During the dry phase, a midday depression of rates of CO2 assimilation was observed. The lowest leaf area index (F) was c. 2 in November\xe2\x80\x93December, when the flood plain was dry, and again in May, when the rising floodwaters were submerging leaves faster than they were replaced. The maximum F of c. 5 was in August when the floodwaters were receding rapidly. Canopy light interception efficiency varied from 0.90 to 0.98. Calculated rates of canopy photosynthesis exceeded 18 mol C m-2 mo-1 throughout the period of flooding, with a peak of 37 mol C m-2 mo-1 in August, but declined to 13 mol C m-2 mo-1 in November during the dry phase. Estimated uptake of carbon by the canopy from the atmosphere, over 12 months, was 3.57 kg C m-2. This was insufficient to account for the 3.99 kg C m-2 of net primary production, measured simultaneously by destructive harvesting. It is postulated that this discrepancy might be accounted for by internal diffusion of CO2 from the CO2-rich waters and sediments via the roots and stems to the sites of assimilation in the leaves.'

Abstract: 'Although strip clear-cutting has a long history of use in the temperate zone, it was only recently introduced for timber extraction in tropical rain forests, where it is known as the Palcaz\xc3\xba Forest Management System. In this system heterogeneous tropical forests are managed for native gap-dependent timber species by simulating gap dynamics through clear-cutting long, narrow strips every 40\xc2\xa0years. As part of an assessment of the sustainability of this system, we evaluated the recovery of tree basal area, species richness, and composition after 15\xc2\xa0years of regeneration on two strips (30\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0150\xc2\xa0m) clear-cut in 1989 in Jenaro Herrera, Peru. Timber stocking and the effects of silvicultural thinning were assessed in both strips. The strips recovered 58\xe2\x80\x9373% of their original basal area and 45\xe2\x80\x9368% of their original tree species richness. Although both strips recovered more than 50% of their original composition, commercial species had lower basal areas and lower densities than in the forest before the clearing. Pioneer species with high basal areas remained dominant 15\xc2\xa0years after the cutting. Silvicultural thinning in 1996 reduced the abundance of pioneer species in both strips, and increased the abundance of commercial species in one of the strips. Half of one strip was harvested by deferment-cut (only commercial trees >30\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh and \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d species >5\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh were cut); regeneration here had greater abundance of commercial species and lower abundance of pioneer species. The low stocking of commercial trees challenges the sustainability claims for this forest management system.'

Abstract: 'Nitrogen variations at different spatial scales and integrated across functional groups were addressed for lowland tropical forests in the Brazilian Amazon as follows: (1) how does N availability vary across the region over different spatial scales (regional\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0landscape scale); (2) how are these variations in N availability integrated across plant functional groups (legume\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0non-legume trees). Leaf N, P, and Ca concentrations as well the leaf N isotope ratios (\xce\xb415N) from a large set of legume and non-legume tree species were measured. Legumes had higher foliar N/Ca ratios than non-legumes, consistent with the high energetic costs in plant growth associated with higher foliar P/Ca ratios found in legumes than in non-legumes. At the regional level, foliar \xce\xb415N decreased with increasing rainfall. At the landscape level, N availability was higher in the forests on clayey soils on the plateau than in forests on sandier soils. The isotope as well as the non-isotope data relationships here documented, explain to a large extent the variation in \xce\xb415N signatures across gradients of rainfall and soil. Although at the regional level, the precipitation regime is a major determinant of differences in N availability, at the landscape level, under the same precipitation regime, soil type seems to be a major factor influencing the availability of N in the Brazilian Amazon forest.'

Abstract: 'Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into pastures or annual crops will likely lead to changes in the local microclimate of those regions. Larger diurnal fluctuations of surface temperature and humidity deficit, increased surface runoff during rainy periods and decreased runoff during the dry season, and decreased soil moistrue are to be expected.'

Abstract: '\nThe Brazilian\xe2\x80\x93German project EcoRespira-Amazon currently conducts a study of soil respiration and soil chemistry in the Brazilian Amazon basin that comparatively examines forested land with post-forest land cover. The Amazon region, long recognized as a key component of the global carbon cycle and a tipping point in the global climate system, covers an area of 7\xc2\xa0million km2; this study provides representative regional data that will help to fill existing knowledge gaps and to verify (or falsify) current assumptions on the role of humid tropical forest regions in the climate system.'

Abstract: 'The frequent occurrence of sympatric series of closely related plant species in tropical rainforests has evoked claims for and against the application of the competitive exclusion principle in these ecosystems. Narrow niche limits defined by biotic as well as abiotic specialization have been reported for sympatric species of the same genus or family. In Amazonian lowland rainforests this question deserves renewed attention because: (1) the existence of edaphically defined community types has recently been well established, and (2) spatio-ecological niche segregation of congeneric species may help explain not only the maintenance of the high Amazonian alpha-diversity, but also its origin through sympatric ecological speciation. In this study, the morphology, ecology, and distribution patterns of two species,Clidemia epiphytica andC. longifolia (Melastomataceae), from western Amazonia, were analyzed. The aims were to find out whether they really are two distinct taxonomic species and if so, whether they also can be considered biological species; if the species are sympatric; and if they are ecologically specialized. The results showed that the morphological variation of the species seems continuous, but that they exhibit opposite morphological responses to variation in soil cation concentration, which suggests that they also are separate biological species. Furthermore, the species occur sympatrically but in different habitats. It is suggested that a part of the enigma of sympatric congeners in rainforests may be explainable by spatial segregation stemming from ecological specialization in relation to subtle environmental variation. It is hypothesized that the studied species are a good candidate case of sympatric speciation driven by ecological specialization.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Amazon region is perceived a most precious biome due to its various globally relevant functions and resources. The Amazon forest is considered a key control for the global and regional climate system (Trumbore et al. 2015; Coe et al. 2017) and is a principal driver for the global and regional water cycle (Castello and Macedo 2016; Getirana 2016; Gimeno et al. 2012). It is home to a unique share of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s genetic resources (Laurance et al. 2012; Pimm et al. 2014; Myers et al. 2000) as well as a rich human cultural heritage which includes indigenous populations yet unexplored (Walker et al. 2016; Pringle 2014). The Brazilian savannah ecosystems, known as Cerrado, add another set of unique wildlife habitats (Simon et al. 2009). Both ecosystems represent important resources for the Brazilian and global economy, yet there are still serious issues regarding sustainable natural resources management. Up until today, the ongoing destruction of both ecosystems has stirred attention worldwide.'

Abstract: 'We studied the phylogeography and demographical history of Tabebuia serratifolia (Bignoniaceae) to understand the disjunct geographical distribution of South American seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs). We specifically tested if the multiple and isolated patches of SDTFs are current climatic relicts of a widespread and continuously distributed dry forest during the last glacial maximum (LGM), the so called South American dry forest refugia hypothesis, using ecological niche modelling (ENM) and statistical phylogeography. We sampled 235 individuals of T. serratifolia in 17 populations in Brazil and analysed the polymorphisms at three intergenic chloroplast regions and ITS nuclear ribosomal DNA.'

Abstract: 'Predation has been suggested to play a major role in the evolution of primate ecology, although reports of predation events are very rare. Mammalian carnivores, raptors, and snakes are known predators of Neotropical primates, and most reported attacks by snakes are attributed to Boa constrictor (terrestrial boas). Here, we document the predation of a squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) by an Amazon tree boa (Corallus hortulanus), the first record of the predation of a platyrrhine primate by this boid. The event was recorded during a nocturnal herpetological survey in the Piratuba Lake Biological Reserve, in the north-eastern Brazilian Amazon. The snake was encountered at 20:00\xc2\xa0hours on the ground next to a stream, at the final stage of ingesting the monkey. The C. hortulanus specimen was 1620\xc2\xa0mm in length (SVL) and weighed 650\xc2\xa0g, while the S. sciureus was a young adult female weighing 600\xc2\xa0g, 92\xc2\xa0% of the body mass of the snake and the largest prey item known to have been ingested by a C. hortulanus. The evidence indicates that the predation event occurred at the end of the afternoon or early evening, and that, while capable of capturing an agile monkey like Saimiri, C. hortulanus may be limited to capturing small platyrrhines such as callitrichines.'

Abstract: 'A climatological description of the convection over Amazonia is based on the seasonal and diurnal cycle analysis. Long series of observations are used from four sites: two sites are representative of dense rainforest, either continental (Manaus) or coastal (Bel\xc3\xa9m); one site is in southeast Amazonia, in a region of ecological tension where forest has been partly replaced by pasture (Vilhena); and finally, one is in the south of Amazonia, in a region typical of savanna (Bras\xc3\xadlia). Each site has a long series of radiosonde and surface observations. Other parameters are also used: rainfall averaged from the raingauges in the vicinity of each site; vegetation monitored using NDVI averaged over 128\xe2\x80\x89km\xc3\x97128\xe2\x80\x89km boxes centred on each site; and total and high cloud cover estimated using the 2.5\xc2\xb0\xc3\x972.5\xc2\xb0 ISCCP products derived from satellite data. It is shown that the main differences between rainforest and savanna or deforested sites occur in the dry season, whereas the magnitude and diurnal cycle of convection as well as amount of rainfall and NDVI are quite similar during the wet season. For the savanna site the seasonal variation is well defined for every parameter, whereas for rainforest sites the vegetation and atmospheric thermodynamics show very weak seasonal variations, yet driving significant diurnal variations of the convection and precipitation. The transition season from dry to wet and the beginning of the wet season is generally the period of strongest intensity of convection.'

Abstract: 'This article explores how anthropogenic modifications of soil condition human adaptive processes on the Amazonian uplands. The occurrence of black earth (a nutrient-rich anthrosol) in nutrient-poor blackwater environments and its cultivation by contemporary residents provide a unique opportunity for understanding the ecological praxis of Amazonian groups. Two years of ethnographic, ethnoscientific, and agronomic research among caboclo residents of the Lower Rio Negro and Rio Urub\xc3\xba confirm that unique cognitive and behavioral orientations characterize black earth and adjacent environments. When compared with cognitive and behavioral orientations to these two environments in distant blackwater regions, data suggest that political-economic, technological, cultural, and ecological factors have had~a strong influence on the trajectory of human-environmental interactions. Data in large part illustrate the utility of historical ecological models, yet point to an interactive role of diverse histories in shaping the range of human responses.'

Abstract: 'Jari plantation is the largest pulp growing operation in the humid tropics, and occupies about 1000 sqkm previously covered by tropical forest. A study of five sites at Jari in 1980 indicated declining soil fertility, and low productivity of pulpwood. Low pulp production at Jari was caused by several factors, one of which appeared to be low soil fertility. The sams sites were re-evaluated in 1987. There was no discernable trend in either nutrients or productivity since 1980.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the socio-economic and environmental implications of soy development in Santar\xc3\xa9m, Par\xc3\xa1, located in the Brazilian Amazon. The settlement history of the region contributes directly to the way in which soy agriculture is currently proceeding in Santar\xc3\xa9m. Government policies and perspectives have been shaped by a history of agrarian colonization of Amazon forests, and the small farmers, or colonos, who are now being bought out by soy agribusiness are also rooted in this history. As a means of ascertaining the current state and interaction of soy actors with the burgeoning soy-based economy in the area, field research was conducted on the role of primary and secondary forests for soy production. Research also included an analysis of valuation discourses \xe2\x80\x93 that is, how the differing soy actors (local government, agribusiness, conservation NGOs, and small farmers) assign value to types of forests and their different interpretations of what constitutes environmental degradation. The ways in which these different actors assign such values to forests and how they structure the definition of environmental degradation is a key factor in determining who \xe2\x80\x9cwins\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9closes\xe2\x80\x9d in the realm of Amazon development. Significant environmental and socio-economic implications of soy expansion, especially for the colonos, are not taken into account because the dominant rhetoric of Amazonian development ignores their contribution to social and ecological diversity. This omission keeps colono communities living at poverty level and even exacerbates colono poverty under the soy development project. The colonos and their representatives are responding by setting forth their own, competing valuations of primary and secondary forests that contrast sharply with state soy growing schemes and NGO plans for \xe2\x80\x9csustainable soy.\xe2\x80\x9d These have their roots in local knowledge and best practices.'

Abstract: ' Tovomita trachycarpa, T. vismiifolia and T. volkeri (Clusiaceae) are described, illustrated and mapped, and their diagnostic features are compared with those of similar species. Papillae are recorded for the first time for the genus, on the leaf blades, inflorescences and flower buds of T. vismiifolia, giving these structures a ferruginous color. Morphology of pollen grain and selected features of the leaf blade are discussed for the new species.'

Abstract: 'Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were surveyed for species richness and abundance in sporulation in six distinct land uses in the western Amazon region of Brazil. Areas included mature pristine forest and sites converted to pasture, crops, agroforestry, young and old secondary forest. A total of 61 AMF morphotypes were recovered and 30% of them could not be identified to known species. Fungal communities were dominated by Glomus species but Acaulospora species produced the most abundant sporulation. Acaulospora gedanensis cf., Acaulospora foveata, Acaulospora spinosa, Acaulospora tuberculata, Glomus corymbiforme, Glomus sp15, Scutellospora pellucida, and Archaeospora trappei sporulated in all land use areas. Total spore numbers were highly variable among land uses. Mean species richness in crop, agroforestry, young and old secondary forest sites was twice that in pristine forest and pasture. fungal communities were dominated in all land use areas except young secondary forest by two or three species which accounted for 48% to 63% of all sporulation. Land uses influenced AMF community in (1) frequency of occurrence of sporulating AMF species, (2) mean species diversity, and (3) relative spore abundance. Conversion of pristine forest into distinct land uses does not appear to reduce AMF diversity. Cultural practices adopted in this region maintain a high diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.'

Abstract: "Forestry practices and high rates of land clearance for agriculture are causing genetic erosion of valuable tree species in the Peruvian Amazon, thereby endangering the economic sustainability of rural communities and limiting Peru's opportunities for the development of new timber and non-timber forest products. The potential utility and limitations of six low-input interventions to help forestall further genetic erosion in the region are discussed, with a focus on local community involvement. Improved agroforestry systems may help reduce deforestation by increasing farm productivity, although methods to increase the currently low adoption rate of these technologies need to be developed. Use of strategic tree domestication techniques can also improve farm productivity and prevent inadvertent genetic drift and inbreeding associated with traditional domestication practices, although to have a major impact, current programs need to be extended across the region. Woodlot forestry could supplant selective extraction of timber and offers an attractive opportunity for poverty alleviation if appropriate credit and land tenure policies can be developed. However, it may also result in increased deforestation if activities on public land cannot be controlled. The implementation of improved seed collection systems and simple seed transfer guidelines would help to reduce the collection of seed of poor quality and low genetic diversity, and avoid maladapted plantings, although such programs are difficult to monitor and seed costs may increase. Strategic identification and design of in situ conservation areas would help to ensure the viability of conserved populations, but requires the forfeiture of significant revenue from timber concessions."

Abstract: 'Shifting cultivation practiced by indigenous peoples living at low population densities in tropical forests has often been described as sustainable and compatible with conservation. However, shifting cultivation at increasing population densities has historically been, and still is, a main cause of deforestation worldwide. As many indigenous peoples in tropical forests currently experience rapid demographic growth, this raises the question to what extent their agricultural activities actually contribute to deforestation. This paper examines land use change in an indigenous community in the Ecuadorian Amazon which is only loosely connected to the market economy, and where agriculture is almost exclusively subsistence oriented. During the last seven decades, people have increasingly begun to clear fallows instead of old-growth forest to farm. Although the population was growing at an estimated 1.6% per year, the expansion of the area of land used for agriculture was only 0.4% per year, corresponding to an annual deforestation rate of only 0.015%. Whereas these changes may seem negligible in terms of deforestation, they do cause hardships to the local people, because of increasing walking distance to old-growth forest, and problems with weeds, pests, and decreasing soil productivity when farming after reclearing fallows.'

Abstract: 'Until the 1980s, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon had largely been the result of public policies (incentives, investment). Since the 1990s, with basic infrastructure installed and cattle-ranching turned profitable due to innovations, deforestation has relied on its own endogenous dynamics. To stop this trend, politics will have to use both traditional and modern instruments for influencing economic behaviour, that is, control and sanctions as well as dialogue and negotiation. Since democratisation, civil society organisations (CSOs) have grown in the Amazon region, often with imp ortant support from foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Today, they are important partners for sustainable, bottom-up development strategies. This has become evident in the political mobilisation against two large public infrastructure investment projects: the dam and hydroelectric plant of Belo Monte; and the paving of the federal highway BR-163 between Cuiab\xc3\xa1 and Santar\xc3\xa9m. This article explores how local CSOs perceive these projects, what importance they assign to the environmental dimension and what alliances they build with other, local, national and international actors in order to achieve their objectives.'

Abstract: 'The longest continuous Amazonian palynological record (ca 7010 yrs B.P. to present) from Lake Ayauchi, Ecuador, reveals species-by-species abundance changes during a period of climatic change. Pollen influx from a wet tropical rain forest was found to be high, 1\xc3\x97104\xe2\x88\x92105 grains cm-2 yr-1, although mature forest taxa were poorly represented. Horizons of laminated sediments and weathered gyttja, dated to ca 4200\xe2\x80\x933150 B.P., evidence a period of reduced net water availability. During this period Ficus, Alchornea and Palmae pollen representation appears to decline, although there is no evidence of a major forest compositional change. The lake was reduced to a shallow, possibly seasonal, pool. Zea cultivation was recorded between ca 2850 B.P., (the earliest paleoecological record to date in the Amazon basin) and ca 800 B.P. It is suggested that Zea was cultivated on exposed lake sediment within the crater at times of low water levels. The abandonment of Zea cultivation may have been due to rising water levels or social unrest.'

Abstract: 'We analyzed the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the lower Amazon River (ca. 850\xc2\xa0km from \xc3\x93bidos to the mouth) using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and geochemical tracers. Changes in DOM composition along this lower reach suggest a transition from higher plant-derived DOM to more algal/microbial-derived DOM. This result was likely due to a combination of autochthonous production, alteration of terrigenous DOM as it transits down the river, and increased algal inputs from floodplain lakes and clearwater tributaries during high discharge conditions. Spatial gradients in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied with discharge. Maximal DOC concentrations were observed near the mouth during high water, highlighting the importance of lateral inputs of DOM along the lower river. The majority of DOM molecular formulae did not change within the time it takes the water in the mainstem to be transported through the lower reach. This is indicative of molecules representing a mixture of compounds that are resistant to rapid alteration and reactive compounds that are continuously replenished by the lateral input of terrestrial organic matter from the landscape, tributaries, and floodplains. River water incubations revealed that photo- and bio-transformation alter at most 30% of the DOM molecular formulae. River discharge at the mouth differed from the sum of discharge measurements made at \xc3\x93bidos and the main gauged tributaries in the lower Amazon. This indicates that changes in hydrology and associated variations in the source waters along the lower reach affected the molecular composition of the DOM that is being transported from the Amazon River to the coastal ocean.'

Abstract: 'The paleoecological record allows contemporary ecologists to put current phenomena into the context of a longer time-frame, thereby providing the opportunity to evaluate the importance of slowly operating processes, past cyclic or unusual events, disturbance regimes, and historically constrained phenomena. We briefly outline the environmental history of the Quaternary, discuss the spatial and temporal resolution of the paleoecological evidence for biotic change, and summarize data relevant to such current issues as the nature of the biotic community, the role of disturbance, stability versus rapid change, evolutionary theory, explanations of species diversity, and refugia theory. Finally, we offer examples of the utility of paleoecological techniques for ecologists and environmental scientists.'

Abstract: 'Climate change and its effects on the hydrologic regime of the Amazon basin can impact biogeochemical processes, transportation, flood vulnerability, fisheries and hydropower generation. We examined projections of climate change on discharge and inundation extent in the Amazon basin using the regional hydrological model MGB-IPH with 1-dimensional river hydraulic and water storage simulation in floodplains. Future projections (2070\xe2\x80\x932099) were obtained from five GCMs from IPCC\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Assessment Report CMIP5. Climate projections have uncertainty and results from different climate models did not agree in total Amazon flooded area or discharge anomalies along the main stem river. Overall, model runs agree better with wetter (drier) conditions over western (eastern) Amazon. Results indicate that increased mean and maximum river discharge for large rivers draining the Andes in the northwest contributes to increased mean and maximum discharge and inundation extent over Peruvian floodplains and Solim\xc3\xb5es River (annual mean-max: +9\xc2\xa0% - +18.3\xc2\xa0%) in western Amazonia. Decreased river discharges (mostly dry season) are projected for eastern basins, and decreased inundation extent at low water (annual min) in the central (\xe2\x88\x9215.9\xc2\xa0%) and lower Amazon (\xe2\x88\x924.4\xc2\xa0%).'

Abstract: 'The Amazon region represents approximately 35% of the Brazilian coastline and includes the states of Amap\xc3\xa1, Par\xc3\xa1, and Maranh\xc3\xa3o. After several years, the Amazon coastal zone has not made clear progress and has failed to show important results in terms of management plans based on the weak societal and local community support, the absence of a strong institutional coordination, and the scarcity of resources. This study aims to present and discuss the existence of others important factors that have obstructed the development of these plans, specifically, describing and analyzing the uncertainties regarding the redefinition of coastal zone boundaries, integrated management concepts, stake-holders responsibility, and governmental disinterest associated with the area by the government and society. Finally, it is considered the possibility of the emergence of new driving forces for the implementation and development of the State Coastal Zone Management Plan in the Amazon region among which the following stand out: the territorial fragmentation of the states in the Amazon coastal zone, the increased exploitation pressure for coastal zone resources, and the role of global climatic change on coastal areas.'

Abstract: 'A sample of 94 accessions of Theobroma cacao L. (cacao), representing four populations from the Brazilian Amazon (Acre, Rond\xc3\xb4nia, lower Amazon and upper Amazon) were analyzed using microsatellite markers to assess the genetic diversity and the natural population structure. From the 19 microsatellite loci tested, 11 amplified scorable products, revealing a total of 49 alleles, including two monomorphic loci. The Brazilian upper Amazon population contained the largest genetic diversity, with the most polymorphic loci, the highest observed heterozygosity; and the majority of rare alleles, thereby this region might be considered part of the center of diversity of the species. The observed heterozygosity for all the Brazilian populations (Ho  = 0.347) was comparable with values reported for other similar upper Amazon Forastero cacao populations, with the Acre and Rond\xc3\xb4nia displaying the lowest values. The lower Amazon population, traditionally defined as highly homozygous, presented an unexpectedly high observed heterozygosity (Ho = 0.372), disclosing rare and distinct alleles, with large identity with the upper Amazon population. It was hypothesized that part of the lower Amazon population might derive from successive natural or intentional introduction of planting material from other provenances, mainly upper Amazon. Most of the loci exhibited a lower observed heterozygosity than expected, suggesting that self-pollination might be more common than usually assumed in cacao, but excess of homozygotes might also derive from sub-grouping (Wahlund effect) or from sampling related individuals. Most of the gene diversity was found to occur within groups, with small differentiation between the four Brazilian Amazon populations, typical of species with high gene flow.'

Abstract: 'We sequenced mitochondrial genes of otter (Lontra longicaudis and Pteronura brasiliensis) and dolphin (Inia sp.) species to provide new systematics data and to test hypotheses that offer explanations as to the Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity. Four of the 11 hypotheses tested --Paleogeography (PH), Recent Lagoon (RLH), Hydrogeological Recent Change (HRCH), and Refugia (RH)-- support the evolution of these three species. As part of this comparative phylogenetic study, we also considered the degree of water dependence of each species. For the least water dependent of the three species, L. longicaudis, only HRCH and RH had an influence on genetic structure, although it was relatively minor. For the more water dependent otter species, P. brasiliensis, our analyses stressed the significance of a single PH event along with two lesser important PH events. However, its gene diversification basically occurred during the Pleistocene and our analyses did detect a relatively small influence of HRCH and RH. For the completely water dependent species, Inia, we detected two significant PH events. Its genetic structure was considerably more developed than in either otter species, although the Pleistocene was a very important period of genetic diversification for the pink river dolphins (HRCH and RLH).

Abstract: 'New data shows that edible fruit and nut production in Amazonian forests is substantially lower than most conservationists assume. Direct measures of production in Amazonian Peru show that two terra firma forest types produced significantly less edible fruit than an alluvial soil forest. Swamp forest produced more edible fruit than any other forest type measured. Palms produce 60% of edible fruit productivity, averaged over three forest types, but the most preferred palm fruits are difficult to harvest because they are borne too high for easy access by collectors. Forest fruit collection in Amazonia is less productive in the short-term than all other food-producing activities except for hunting and cattle ranching. Technological, social and political changes are essential so that sustainable but intrinsically low-yielding extractive activities like fruit collecting become more attractive to Amazonians.'

Abstract: 'Small-scale gold mining is a significant source of Hg to the environment and may reach an annual input of about 450\xc2\xa0t of Hg, mostly in South America, Russia and Asia. Countries of the Amazon Basin and Russia are the major contributors. On a regional scale, this source can contribute to more than 50% of the total Hg anthropogenic emission. Because of amalgam burning and bullion smelting under generally uncontrolled conditions, the majority of the emission is to the atmosphere. Therefore, on a global scale small-scale gold mining contributes about 20% of the total Hg atmospheric emissions from human activities. Most emissions occur in tropical developing countries. Preliminary results from research in the Amazon region suggest the Hg cycling in tropical rainforest environments is probably more dynamic and critical than in previously studied temperate environments, being strongly influenced by the existing ecological cycles and affected by land-use changes. At least two components of the Hg cycle can be identified. A short-term component, involving methylation of deposited Hg2+ in aquatic systems and a long-term component, involving the re-emission of Hg deposited in soils particularly because of changes in soil use.'

Abstract: 'Using a robust global precipitation database, we analyze coast-to-interior seasonal precipitation distributions over the world\xe2\x80\x99s major forest regions. We find that the active functioning of boreal forests in summer is associated with an intense ocean-to-land moisture transport, which declines in winter when forest functioning is minimal. This seasonal switch manifests itself as a change in the exponential scale length of precipitation distribution, which exceeds 15\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89103\xc2\xa0km in summer but decreases to (3\xe2\x80\x934)\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89103\xc2\xa0km in winter. In equatorial rainforests, which are photosynthetically active throughout the year, annual precipitation remains approximately constant, while the coefficient of variation of monthly precipitation significantly declines toward the continent interior. Precipitation over forest during the periods of active forest functioning is always higher than over the adjacent ocean. Such precipitation patterns support the biotic pump concept according to which forest cover drives the ocean-to-land atmospheric moisture transport on a continental scale.'

Abstract: 'There is a profound absence of knowledge of infestation prevalence and host-use by mistletoes of mature South American tropical rainforests. In this study, we fill this gap using information gathered from felled trees at a logging concession area in Amazonian Brazil. We sampled individuals of 18 tree species, which occurred in two forest physiognomies; open forest with canopy interrupted by palm trees and closed, denser forest, with emergent trees. We hypothesized that infection incidence would be higher in open than in closed forest, irrespective of the mistletoe species involved. In addition, we expected that mistletoe parasitism would be higher on host species that were more abundant, taller, deciduous, and had less dense wood. We sampled 870 individual trees in both sites combined. All but one host species was infected by at least one species of mistletoe. We found 13 mistletoe species/morphospecies, Loranthaceae (7) and Viscaceae (6), parasitizing very different hosts. Mistletoe infection incidence was higher in the closed forest (10.3%) than in the open forest (5.4%). In the closed forest, host height influenced incidence positively, while deciduousness had a negative influence. Our results show that mistletoes are common in the canopy of pristine tropical forests and, contrary to expectations, that infection incidence was higher in the closed forest. The positive relation between infection incidence and host height in this forest type suggests that emergent trees have higher chances of being infected than individuals of correspondent species in the lower forest layers.'

Abstract: 'Genetic tagging is the unique identification of individuals by their DNA profile. This technique is well established in mammals, but it has not yet been widely adopted for birds. Extraction methods for minute amounts of DNA even enable the use of genetic tagging from non-invasive samples, like hair, scat, or feather. In this study, we evaluate the potential for non-invasive genetic tagging by using molted feathers of two sympatric macaw species in the Peruvian Amazon. Correct species identification is critical when relying on feathers for genetic analysis, so we describe multilocus methods for species identification. We evaluate the quality of naturally shed macaw feathers in tropical environmental conditions and present new primers for molecular sexing on the feather samples. We successfully validated 11 microsatellite markers for use in genetic tagging studies on large macaws and confirmed that DNA from blood and feather samples yields equivalent population genetic patterns. The techniques described here can be implemented for other birds with higher conservation concern.'

Abstract: 'Microbial biodiversity provides an increasingly important source of medically and industrially useful compounds. We have isolated 14 actinomycete species from a collection of approximately 300 plant stem samples from the upper Amazonian rainforest in Peru. All of the cultured isolates produce substances with inhibitory activity directed at a range of potential fungal and bacterial pathogens. For some organisms, this activity is very broad in spectrum while other organisms show specific activity against a limited number of organisms. Two of these organisms preferentially inhibit bacterial test organisms over eukaryotic organisms. rDNA sequence analysis indicates that these organisms are not equivalent to any other cultured deposits in GenBank. Our results provide evidence of the untapped biodiversity in the form of biologically active microbes present within the tissues of higher plants.'

Abstract: 'Fire hazard is a mounting concern in tropical rainforests of the Brazilian Amazon and has raised awareness within the science community of the links between agricultural fire use, drought and accidental fire. As a result, fire is being addressed as a crisis event with mitigation focused on those who light fires, particularly smallholder agriculturalists. Little attention is paid to the historical and ongoing ways in which Amazon landscapes and peoples have been made more susceptible to fire. Frontier regions of the Brazilian Amazon serve a variety of functions within the larger Brazilian society, including as extractive reserves for economic development, as social safety valves to reduce population pressures, and as areas to support urban regional integration. Each of these functions has impacted frontier environments in ways that create more flammable landscapes and/or shape the vulnerability of people to fire hazard. This paper uses a case study inthe Brazilian Lower Amazon to understand how vulnerability to fire hazard develops. It argues that if fire mitigation remains centered on fire as a crisis event, an understanding of what constitutes frontier spaces of vulnerability, both in landscape and in populations, will be limited.'

Abstract: 'The transfer of carbon (C) from Amazon forests to aquatic ecosystems as CO2 supersaturated in groundwater that outgases to the atmosphere after it reaches small streams has been postulated to be an important component of terrestrial ecosystem C budgets. We measured C losses as soil respiration and methane (CH4) flux, direct CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the stream surface and fluvial export of dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC), and particulate C over an annual hydrologic cycle from a 1,319-ha forested Amazon perennial first-order headwater watershed at Tanguro Ranch in the southern Amazon state of Mato Grosso. Stream pCO2 concentrations ranged from 6,491 to 14,976\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcatm and directly-measured stream CO2 outgassing flux was 5,994\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0677\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921 of stream surface.

Despite high flux rates from the stream surface, the small area of stream itself (970\xc2\xa0m2, or 0.007% of watershed area) led to small directly-measured annual fluxes of CO2 (0.44\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.05\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921) and CH4 (0.07\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.02\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921) per unit watershed land area.

However, stream discharge accounted for only 12% of the modeled annual watershed water output because deep groundwater flows dominated total runoff from the watershed.

Abstract: ' The significance of phenological characteristics, stomatal conductance of the leaves, and stem water storage fluctuations for the regulation of xylem sap flow in an evergreen (Carapa guianensis Aubl.), in a semi-deciduous (Swietenia macrophylla King), and in a deciduous (Cedrela odorata L.) Meliaceae species was studied in a 7-year-old plantation near Manaus, Brazil. The study responds to the increasing demand for knowledge on the water relations of highly exploited timber trees of the Amazon. Xylem sap flow measurements indicated that the daily sap flow of Carapa (3.8\xc2\xa0l day\xe2\x80\x931 tree\xe2\x80\x931 to 16.4\xc2\xa0l day\xe2\x80\x931 tree\xe2\x80\x931) exceeded the daily sap flow of Swietenia (2.4\xc2\xa0l day\xe2\x80\x931 tree\xe2\x80\x931 to 7.0\xc2\xa0l day\xe2\x80\x931 tree\xe2\x80\x931) and Cedrela (1.6\xc2\xa0l day\xe2\x80\x931 tree\xe2\x80\x931 to 11.6\xc2\xa0l day\xe2\x80\x931 tree\xe2\x80\x931) during the entire year, although the highest flux densities were measured in Cedrela. The decrease in xylem sap flow observed in periods with low soil water potentials and high atmospheric vapor saturation deficits was more pronounced in the deciduous (Cedrela) and semi-deciduous species (Swietenia) than the evergreen species (Carapa). Carapa, which has the highest daily sap flow, had the highest biomass and sapwood portion. The high flux densities measured in Cedrela most likely result from the large earlywood vessels in this species. The seasonal variation of xylem sap flow of the three species was correlated with the stomatal conductance of the leaves measured by infiltration experiments. Stem water storage fluctuations in Carapa and Swietenia were predominantly due to transpiration; in Cedrela it was predominantly due to evaporative water loss on the stem surface during dry periods.'

Abstract: ' Conversion to cattle pasture is the most common fate of the \xe2\x89\x88426,000 km2 of tropical forest that has been deforested in the Brazilian Amazon. Yet little is known about the biomass, C, nutrient pools, or their responses to the frequent fires occurring in these pastures. We sampled biomass, nutrient pools and their losses or transformation during fire in three Amazonian cattle pastures with typical, but different, land-use histories. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) ranged from to 53 to 119\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921. Residual wood debris from the forests that formally occupied the sites composed the majority of TAGB (47\xe2\x80\x9387%). Biomass of fine fuels, principally pasture grasses, was \xe2\x89\x8816\xe2\x80\x9329\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921. Grasses contained as much as 52% of the aboveground K pool and the grass and litter components combined composed as much as 88% of the aboveground P pool. Fires consumed 21\xe2\x80\x9384% of the TAGB. Losses of C to the atmosphere ranged from 11 to 21\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921 and N losses ranged from 205 to 261\xe2\x80\x89kg ha\xe2\x88\x921. Losses of S, P, Ca, and K were <33\xe2\x80\x89kg ha\xe2\x88\x921. There were no changes in surface soil (0\xe2\x80\x9310\xe2\x80\x89cm) nutrient concentration in pastures compared to adjacent primary forests. Fires occur frequently in cattle pastures (i.e., about every 2 years) and pastures are now likely the most common type of land burned in Amazonia. The first 6 years of a pastures existence would likely include the primary forest slash fire and three pasture fires. Based upon our results, the cumulative losses of N from these fires would be 1935\xe2\x80\x89kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 (equivalent to 94% of the aboveground pool of primary forest). Postfire aboveground C pools in old pastures are as low as 3% of those in adjacent primary forest. The initial primary forest slash fire and the repeated fires occurring in the pastures result in the majority of aboveground C and nutrient pools being released via combustion processes rather than decomposition processes.'

Abstract: 'A nocturnal gravity wave was detected over a south-western Amazon forest during the Large-Scale Biosphere\xe2\x80\x93Atmosphere experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in the course of the dry-to-wet season campaign on October 2002. The atmospheric surface layer was stably stratified and had low turbulence activity, based on friction velocity values. However, the passage of the wave, an event with a period of about 180\xe2\x80\x93300 s, caused negative turbulent fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and positive sensible heat fluxes, as measured by the eddy-covariance system at 60 m (\xe2\x89\x8830 m above the tree tops). The evolution of vertical profiles of air temperature, specific humidity and wind speed during the wave movement revealed that cold and drier air occupied the sub-canopy space while high wind speeds were measured above the vegetation. The analysis of wind speed and scalars high frequency data was performed using the wavelet technique, which enables the decomposition of signals in several frequencies allowed by the data sampling conditions. The results showed that the time series of vertical velocity and air temperature were \xe2\x88\x9290\xc2\xb0 out of phase during the passage of the wave, implying no direct vertical transport of heat. Similarly, the time series of vertical velocity and CO2 concentration were 90\xc2\xb0 out of phase. The wave was not directly associated with vertical fluxes of this variable but the mixing induced by its passage resulted in significant exchanges in smaller scales as measured by the eddy-covariance system. The phase differences between horizontal velocity and both air temperature and CO2 concentration were, respectively, zero and 180\xc2\xb0, implying phase and anti-phase relationships. As a result, the wave contributed to positive horizontal fluxes of heat and negative horizontal fluxes of carbon dioxide. Such results have to be considered in nocturnal boundary-layer surface-atmosphere exchange schemes for modelling purposes.'

Abstract: 'Accurate malaria diagnosis is mandatory for the treatment and management of severe cases. Moreover, individuals with asymptomatic malaria are not usually screened by health care facilities, which further complicates disease control efforts. The present study compared the performances of a malaria rapid diagnosis test (RDT), the thick blood smear method and nested PCR for the diagnosis of symptomatic malaria in the Brazilian Amazon. In addition, an innovative computational approach was tested for the diagnosis of asymptomatic malaria.'

Abstract: 'In order to maximize escaping success, prey may change their predator avoidance behaviors according to their susceptibility. Morphological development during ontogeny may lead to different susceptibility to predators. Consequently, prey may exhibit different predator avoidance strategies according to the ontogenetic state. In this study,\xc2\xa0we used tadpoles of the Amazon milk frog Trachycephalus resinifictrix (Anura, Hylidae) to evaluate how variation in the ability to actively escape owed to the mobility acquired through ontogeny affects the adoption of predator avoidance strategies. We sampled tadpoles (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0384) in temporary ponds and divided them in four consecutive developmental stages according to body size and mobility capacity. Subsequently, we measured their movement and spatial distribution when subjected to chemical cues of predators or control solutions. We found that they spent less time moving and increased spatial aggregation after receiving solutions with predator cues, independent of their developmental stage. These results indicate that the variation in escape capacity through larval ontogeny does not determine their antipredator strategy. Since tadpoles of T. resinifictrix typically grow in environments with reduced space for active escaping, such as tree holes and bromeliads, it may be that the ability to flee from predators is absent, even when this behavior increases the survival chances.'

Abstract: 'As traditional slash-and-burn systems with prolonged fallow periods are no longer feasible in most parts of the tropics, improved agroforestry systems have high potential to increase the productivity of farming systems and sustain continuous crop production. Our objective was to assess biophysical and economic performance of planted leguminous tree fallow (using Inga edulis) compared to the traditional slash-and-burn farming system, practiced by farmers on fields infested with noxious weedy grass Imperata brasiliensis around the city of Pucallpa, Peru. An existing agroforestry model SCUAF was used to predict biophysical factors, such as changes in soil characteristics and farm outputs (crop and tree yield). While a cost\xe2\x80\x93benefit analysis spreadsheet, which uses the output from SCUAF and economic data on input/output levels and prices, calculates economic performance of the systems. The Inga fallow system can provide improvements to a range of soil biophysical measures (C, N, P content). This enables higher levels of farm outputs to be achieved (higher cassava yields). However, for smallholders the improved system must be more economically profitable than the existing one. At prices currently encountered, the Inga fallow system is more profitable than the Imperata fallow system only in the long-term. In adopting the Inga fallow system, smallholders will incur lower profits in the first years, and it will take approximately 10\xc2\xa0years for smallholders to begin making a profit above that achievable with the Imperata fallow system. Unless smallholders are capable of accepting the lower profitability in first years, they are less likely to adopt the new system.'

Abstract: 'Twenty-four Central Amazonian V\xc3\xa1rzea and Ria lakes, lateral to the Rio Negro and the Rio Solim\xc3\xb5es, were studied for a year and are classified here in terms of physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics. White water (W), mixed water (M) and black water (B) lakes are ranked according to bacterial densities, electrical conductivity, pH, DO, POC, Fe, Si02 and PO4 consumption in the following order W > M > B. The range of Vmax decreased as net primary production increased. Further differentiation among the three lake types is made on the basis of dominant algal species and species diversity.'

Abstract: 'The interplay between extreme events in the Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s precipitation and the anomaly in the temperature of the surrounding oceans is not fully understood, especially its causal relations. In this paper, we investigate the climatic interaction between these regions from 1999 until 2012 using modern tools of complex system science. We identify the time scale of the coupling quantitatively and unveil the non-stationary influence of the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s temperature. The findings show consistently the distinctions between the coupling in the recent major extreme events in Amazonia, such as the two droughts that happened in 2005 and 2010 and the three floods during 1999, 2009 and 2012. Interestingly, the results also reveal the influence over the anomalous precipitation of Southwest Amazon has become increasingly lagged. The analysis can shed light on the underlying dynamics of the climate network system and consequently can improve predictions of extreme rainfall events.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated the impact of two leaf harvesting methods on the clonal understory palm Geonoma deversa. In the first method only the leaves are cut, in the second the complete crown is severed. Stands representative for each method are compared with unharvested stands. Both methods of harvesting reduce clone size and reproductive output (inflorescence and infructescence per clone), and lower the number of ramets available for the next harvest. Cutting only the leaves represents a better method of harvest because of a lower impact on the residual stock. Economic analysis reveals that the value of this resource (standing leaf value) is low (2 to 26 U.S. $/ha) compared with labor costs that can be between 55 to 86% of palm thatch revenues. Harvesting Geonoma leaves generates a net present value (NPV) that ranges from 3 to 191 U.S. $/ha depending on the stand location, the wage, and the interest rate employed for the calculation.'

Abstract: ' Tetragonisca angustula is a stingless bee species widely distributed in Brazil. Past studies have shown a rich native flora supplying this meliponine with pollen and nectar. The aim of this study was to compare the food provisions of T. angustula in two areas in the Lower Amazon mesoregion in the state of Par\xc3\xa1 and two areas of caatinga vegetation in the state of Bahia, Brazil. We used a published data set of 57 samples of honey and 46 samples of pollen stored in colonies of T. angustula. The honeys from the Lower Amazon and from the caatinga displayed 23 and 16 pollen types with frequency higher than >10\xc2\xa0%, respectively, with emphasis on the families Fabaceae, Solanaceae, and Urticaceae. In the pollen stored samples, 18 and 11 pollen types were found, respectively. Cluster analyses (Dice similarity) performed with these published pollen spectra of the honeys grouped the samples from each geographic region with higher similarity than the analyses performed with the pollen spectra of the stored pollen.'

Abstract: 'One of the less studied components of carbon cycling that could improve our understanding of how and how strongly Amazonian ecosystems act as sinks or sources of carbon is the amount that is carried downstream by rivers. In this paper, we show that a headwater river can carry from 25 to 130\xc2\xa0% of the reported sink for Amazonian forests, therefore not being negligible for ecosystem-level carbon budgets. Based on monthly measurements from May 2004 to April 2005 of the upper Purus River, southwestern Amazonia, we found that: water pH, dissolved oxygen, specific electrical conductivity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were inversely related to water discharge and precipitation; pCO2 was directly and strongly related to discharge and precipitation, and to a lesser extent to pH and dissolved oxygen; and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was not related to any measured variable. Annual flux of dissolved carbon (DIC\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0DOC) at the sampling site was estimated as 604\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa055\xc2\xa0Gg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0a\xe2\x88\x921. More than 75\xc2\xa0% was in the form of bicarbonate, with the remainder as CO2 and DOC. This amount is equivalent to 0.15\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.01\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0a\xe2\x88\x921 in the upstream drainage basin, which is on the same order of magnitude as terrestrial carbon fixation.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon contains some of the most critical ecosystems on earth and Igap\xc3\xb3 forests are one of those ecosystems. They are flooded by \xe2\x80\x9cblack-water\xe2\x80\x9d, leached runoff of forest litter. To help in our understanding of igap\xc3\xb3 forests, and to act as a resource for their future research, I review what we know about their composition and structure. I used my own sampling data to construct floristics tables of the tree species, and tables of physical structural parameters such as tree density, species richness basal area and above-ground biomass (AGB). In addition I used data gotten from literature searches on google scholar, biosys, WorldCat discovery services and other databases for all papers that sampled trees in plots within igap\xc3\xb3 forests. I found there was a total of 59 families sampled in all the plots. The families with the most genera were Fabaceae and Caesalpiniaceae, with the most species were Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae, and with the most tree stems were Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The most common genera were Mouriri and Lincania and the most common species were Virola elongate and Swartzia polyphylla. For structure, total stems had a wide range between 167 and 683 per ha, stem sizes generally conformed to a \xe2\x80\x9creverse J\xe2\x80\x9d distribution pattern, mean stem sizes were ~20\xc2\xa0cm diameter at breast height, there was a species richness range between 90 and 119 per ha, and igap\xc3\xb3 forests were more open than other forest-types in the Amazon basin. While these plots were in primary igap\xc3\xb3 forest, my samplings of secondary igap\xc3\xb3 forests showed they had a reduced structure compared to primary igap\xc3\xb3 forests but were similar within the different kinds of secondary igap\xc3\xb3 forests.'

Abstract: 'Agronomic studies on soil phosphorus dynamics have primarily focused on the plant-available inorganic P pool. However organic P and less labile inorganic pools can contribute significantly to plant P uptake. The objectives of this study were to determine the changes in inorganic and organic P pools of varying lability in and below the plowlayer after 13 years of continuous cultivation and fertilization on a Typic Paleudult in Yurimaguas, Peru. The field experiment was established after slash and burn of a secondary forest and included non-fertilized and fertilized treatments. The yearly cropping pattern consisted of an upland rice (Oryza sativa),-corn (Zea mays),-soybean (Glycine max) rotation. A modified version of the Hedley et al. procedure was used to sequentially fractionate soil P into increasingly recalcitrant organic and inorganic pools. Plowlayer accumulation of the fertilizer P occurred in all P pools. The greatest increase was in the NaOH extractable inorganic P pool. In the non-fertilized plots, the organic P decreased by 42%. Phosphorus fertilization resulted in significant movement of P below plowlayer. The accumulation occurred mostly in inorganic and organic P pools that are not quantified by traditional soil-P test methods. In fertilized plots sub-plowlayer total P increased by 90 \xce\xbcg g\xe2\x88\x921 (87%) while resin extractable P increased only 4 \xce\xbcg g\xe2\x88\x921. Phosphorus content of the organic P pools below the plowlayer increased by 24 \xce\xbcg g\xe2\x88\x921 (50%) in fertilized plots. The inclusion of less labile P pools in studies of P movement and the evaluation of P fertilizer residual values could lead to a better understanding of P dynamics and hence better management of P fertilization.'

Abstract: '\nThe taxonomic position of a bacterium isolated from water samples from the Rio Negro, in Amazon, Brazil, was determined by using a polyphasic approach. The organism formed a distinct phyletic line in the Chromobacterium 16S rRNA gene tree and had chemotaxonomic and morphological properties consistent with its classification in this genus. It was found to be closely related to Chromobacterium vaccinii DSM 25150T (98.6\xc2\xa0% 16S rRNA gene similarity) and shared 98.5\xc2\xa0% 16S rRNA gene similarity with Chromobacterium piscinae LGM 3947T. DNA\xe2\x80\x93DNA relatedness studies showed that isolate CBMAI 310T belongs to distinct genomic species. The isolate was readily distinguished from the type strain of these species using a combination of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties. Thus, based on genotypic and phenotypic data, it is proposed that isolate CBMAI 310T (=DSM 26508T) be classified in the genus Chromobacterium as the type strain of a novel species, namely, Chromobacterium amazonense sp. nov.'

Abstract: 'Regenerating forests have become a common land-cover type throughout the Brazilian Amazon. However, the potential for these systems to accumulate and store C and nutrients, and the fluxes resulting from them when they are cut, burned, and converted back to croplands and pastures have not been well quantified. In this study, we quantified pre- and post-fire pools of biomass, C, and nutrients, as well as the emissions of those elements, at a series of second- and third-growth forests located in the states of Par\xc3\xa1 and Rond\xc3\xb4nia, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) of second- and third-growth forests averaged 134 and 91 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931, respectively. Rates of aboveground biomass accumulation were rapid in these systems, but were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, ranging from 9 to 16 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 year\xe2\x80\x931. Residual pools of biomass originating from primary forest vegetation accounted for large portions of TAGB in both forest types and were primarily responsible for TAGB differences between the two forest types. In second-growth forests this pool (82 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931) represented 58% of TAGB, and in third-growth forests (40 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931) it represented 40% of TAGB. Amounts of TAGB consumed by burning of second- and third-growth forests averaged 70 and 53 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931, respectively. Aboveground pre-fire pools in second- and third-growth forests averaged 67 and 45 Mg C ha\xe2\x80\x931, 821 and 707 kg N ha\xe2\x80\x931, 441 and 341 kg P ha\xe2\x80\x931, and 46 and 27 kg Ca ha\xe2\x80\x931, respectively. While pre-fire pools of C, N, S and K were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, pools of both P and Ca were significantly higher in second-growth forests. This suggests that increasing land use has a negative impact on these elemental pools. Site losses of elements resulting from slashing and burning these sites were highly variable: losses of C ranged from 20 to 47 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931; N losses ranged from 306 to 709 kg ha\xe2\x80\x931; Ca losses ranged from 10 to 145 kg ha\xe2\x80\x931; and P losses ranged from 2 to 20 kg ha\xe2\x80\x931. Elemental losses were controlled to a large extent by the relative distribution of elemental mass within biomass components of varying susceptibilities to combustion and the temperatures of volatilization of each element. Due to a relatively low temperature of volatilization and its concentration in highly combustible biomass pools, site losses of N averaged 70% of total pre-fire pools. In contrast, site losses of P and Ca resulting from burning were 33 and 20% of total pre-fire pools, respectively, as much of the mass of those elements was deposited on site as ash. Pre- and post-fire biomass and elemental pools of second- and third-growth forests, as well as the emissions from those systems, were intermediate between those of primary forests and pastures in the Brazilian Amazon. Overall, regenerating forests have the capacity to act as either large terrestrial sinks or sources of C and nutrients, depending on the course of land-use patterns within the Brazilian Amazon. Combining remote sensing techniques with field measures of aboveground C accumulation in regenerating forests and C fluxes from those forests when they are cut and burned, we estimate that during 1990\xe2\x80\x931991 roughly 104 Tg of C was accumulated by regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon. Further, we estimate that approximately 103 Tg of C was lost via the cutting and burning of regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon during this same period. Since average C accumulations (5.5 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 year\xe2\x80\x931) in regenerating forests were 19% of the C lost when such forests are cut and burned (29.3 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931), our results suggest that when less than 19% of the total area accounted for by secondary forests is cut and burned in a given year, those forests will be net accumulators of C during that year. Conversely, when more than 19% of regenerating forests are burned, those forests will be a net source of C to the atmosphere.'

Abstract: 'In recent years, Amazonian deforestation has become a question of global concern. Deforestation in Amazon is a complex phenomenon in nature and has been related to traditional agriculture expansion. In this work, land use, socioeconomic and conservation indicators, combined with statistical analysis, were used to understand forces associated with patterns of deforestation. This approach was applied in Southern Brazilian Pre-Amazon in Mato Grosso State, which represents an extensive rain forest-savanna ecotone, located in the south border of Amazon biome. Based on data from the last two agricultural censuses (1995/1996\xe2\x80\x932006), we compared agricultural expansion in this area and Mato Grosso state. Results have shown that 85\xc2\xa0% of state deforestation was concentrated in Southern Pre-Amazon and was closely related to increase in number of cattle and pasture area. PCA results pointed that population (92\xc2\xa0%), number of cattle (86.5\xc2\xa0%), pastures (84.2\xc2\xa0%) and tractors (78.4\xc2\xa0%) were variables with highest positive correlation to deforestation. It showed that GDP contributes to an individual axis and has a low correlation to deforestation (37.8\xc2\xa0%). Conservation units and indigenous reserves also contribute to a single axis and were negatively correlated to temporary crops area. Results revealed a significant reduction in production and commercialization of extractive products in the region, revealing that the main, almost only conservation policy in Mato Grosso remains the creation of Special Areas. We suggest that further studies are necessary to screen development alternatives to simple cutting trees down. It is important to diversify strategies for deforestation control, and development aspects must be more seriously considered to reach a sustainable deforestation control policy.'

Abstract: 'Food sharing is found in many traditional societies around the world. The uniqueness of pervasive sharing among humans, especially among non-related individuals, has been explained by a variety of social and ecological models. Here, we investigated whether the sharing of wild meat among hunters in an extractive reserve in a tropical forest is influenced by the kinship, social structure, and biomass of hunted species. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 59 households from 12 villages along the Liberdade River in the Amazon forest. The interviewees mentioned approximately 1.8 tons of hunted animals (25 species) during 177 incursions, and donated 890\xc2\xa0kg of wild meat to other households. The meat-sharing was mainly mediated by the biomass hunted. The higher the biomass, the greater the sharing among households, either between related or non-related hunters. The inter-household sharing of wild meat was dominated by medium- and smaller-bodied species that are commonly hunted. When we look at hunters\xe2\x80\x99 importance in the sharing network, the older hunters and those returning higher biomass were more prone to share in their villages. The overall meat-sharing pattern indicates that hunting activity is involved with social bonds, and it may ultimately favor food security in the studied villages.'

Abstract: 'The current interest in non-timber forest products as an economic option for the Brazilian Amazon represents a radical departure from the policies that have guided development in the region during recent decades. Despite this interest, little is currently known about the forms of resource management or economic strategies practiced by populations dependent on such resources. In this study, we measured the annual income and expenditures of ten households on Combu Island, located in the Amazon estuary near the major port city of Bel\xc3\xa9m; in addition, we documented local uses and management of natural resources on the island Average annual income per household was found to be over U.S. $4000, derived primarily from the harvest and sale of non-timber forest products. The results of this study show that the combination of proximity to a major market and appropriate resource management can lead to high and apparently sustainable economic returns.'

Abstract: "A long-standing assumption in archaeological theory is that pottery in the domestic context represents a form of \xe2\x80\x9cpassive style\xe2\x80\x9d that does not enter into symbolic communication in the political domain. This paper presents ethnoarchaeological data to establish a link between women's active political behavior and pottery style in the domestic context in a small-scale, segmental society in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Analysis of individual variables of style shows that Achuar and Quichua women signify their political alliances in the painted decoration of their domestic pottery more strongly than they signify so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpassive\xe2\x80\x9d processes of learning associated with early enculturation and ethnicity. Furthermore, analysis of women's judgments of pottery as Achuar or Quichua indicates that they decode cues to political alliances in the pottery of other women, including cues to political differences within and between groups. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the principles underlying women's stylistic behavior as part of the political processes involved in the construction and maintenance of social identity and social boundaries."

Abstract: 'Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Cuiab\xc3\xa1-Santar\xc3\xa9m (BR-163) Highway provides a valuable example of ways in which decision-making procedures for infrastructure projects in tropical forest areas need to be reformulated in order to guarantee that environmental concerns are properly weighed. BR-163, which is slated to be paved as an export corridor for soybeans via the Amazon River, traverses an area that is largely outside of Brazilian government control. A climate of generalized lawlessness and impunity prevails, and matters related to environment and to land tenure are especially unregulated. Deforestation and illegal logging have accelerated in anticipation of highway paving. Paving would further speed forest loss in the area, as well as stimulate migration of land thieves (grileiros) to other frontiers. An argument is made that the highway should not be reconstructed and paved until after a state of law has been established and it has been independently certified that sufficient governance prevails to secure protected areas and enforce environmental legislation. A waiting period is needed after this is achieved before proceeding with the highway paving. Above all, the logical sequence of steps must be followed, whereby environmental costs are assessed, reported, and weighed prior to making de facto decisions on implementation of infrastructure projects. Deviation from this logical sequence is a common occurrence in many parts of the world, especially in tropical areas.'

Abstract: ' Are Ecologically Important Tree Species the Most Useful? A Case Study from Indigenous People in the Bolivian Amazon. Researchers have argued that indigenous peoples prefer to use the most apparent plant species, particularly for medicinal uses. However, the association between the ecological importance of a species and its usefulness remains unclear. In this paper we quantify such association for six use categories (firewood, construction, materials, food, medicines, and other uses). We collected data on the uses of 58 tree species, as reported by 93 informants in 22 villages in the Tsimane\xe2\x80\x99 territory (Bolivian Amazon). We calculated the ecological importance of the same species by deriving their importance value index (IVI) in 48 0.1-ha old-growth forest plots. Matching both data sets, we found a positive relation between the IVI of a species and its overall use value (UV) as well as with its UV for construction and materials. We found a negative relation between IVI and UV for species that were reportedly used for medicine and food uses, and no clear pattern for the other categories. We hypothesize that species used for construction or crafting purposes because of their physical properties are more easily substitutable than species used for medicinal or edible purposes because of their chemical properties.'

Abstract: 'With the continuing decline in the global extent of tropical forests, agriculture-dominated landscapes now cover approximately 50\xc2\xa0% of the tropical biome. In this context, our ability to understand and influence biodiversity and carbon sequestration in the tropics depends in large part on our understanding of actively managed landscapes. Approximately two-third of deforested lands become pasture in the Neotropics, and therefore, significant changes in their structure represent a potentially important development in terms of carbon sequestration and biodiversity, especially as ecosystem service payment schemes such as REDD+ emerge. The spontaneous emergence of silvo-pastoral landscapes, or pastures with trees, in formerly treeless pastures in the southern Ecuadorian Amazon represents just this kind of potentially significant shift in the structure of landscapes. In this paper, we try to explain this change in pastoral landscapes. Field surveys indicate variable densities of trees in pastures, with stem densities ranging from 30 to 400 per hectare. Analyses of interviews with the heads of small cattle ranching enterprises suggest that cattle ranchers pursue an intentional management strategy of allowing trees to regrow in working pastures to an extent that is ecologically significant. These findings confirm that even cattle ranches, albeit small in scale, can simultaneously produce food and provide important ecosystem services like carbon sequestration.'

Abstract: 'An established body of literature documents current changes in rural livelihoods, agricultural practices, and agrobiodiversity patterns in smallholder communities across the globe. Contributing to this literature, this paper documents change in agricultural practices and agrobiodiversity patterns in a tidal floodplain settlement in Amap\xc3\xa1, Brazil, where in recent years farmers increasingly devote their attention to the production of a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad fruits, an important regional crop with strong local, national and international markets. Research results indicate that farmers are abandoning subsistence production in annual fields to make room for a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad-dominated agroforests. At the same time, farmers are diversifying home gardens, and as a result conserve a portion of the crop diversity once maintained in annual fields in these areas. Agrobiodiversity documented in home gardens is much higher than previously recorded in the study area, and is equal or higher than previously reported in home gardens in other less-market integrated Amazonian communities. Research points to the need for innovative methods to document agrobiodiversity patterns in today\xe2\x80\x99s modifying landscapes and for the historical analysis of such patterns to avoid presumptions that observed changes are unilateral and unidirectional.'

Abstract: 'We conducted a short survey of primates along the R\xc3\xado Curaray in the northern Peruvian Amazon, emphazing rare, threatened or little known species. Contrary to Thorington, (Thorington, R. W., Jr., 1988, Am. J. Primatol. 15:367\xe2\x80\x93371), we found no evidence for sympatry between Saguinus tripartitus and Saguinus fuscicollis, with the former being restricted to the north bank and the latter to the south bank of the R\xc3\xado Curaray. The Curaray also separates two species of Pithecia. The height above ground at which species were encountered increased with body size, providing evidence for vertical stratification within the primate community. The Curaray area still has rich primate diversity compared to other areas in the northern Peruvian Amazon, even though larger species, such as the spider monkeys, are hunted.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity knowledge on insects is urgently needed due to the ever growing demand for food and the consequent deforestation process and loss of natural habitats in many understudied tropical regions. In this paper, we describe the outcome of a biodiversity research on tiger moths performed for the first time in a poorly studied Amazonian landscape\xe2\x80\x94the savanna. We sampled tiger moths monthly with UV automatic light traps for 12 consecutive months in two sampling points in an area of savanna in eastern Amazon, and we compared our results to previously available data for eastern Amazon. We found a total of 91 species of which 80 were identified to species level. The most species-rich subtribes were Phaegopterina and Euchromiina with 32 species each. Species richness and abundance did not differ among sampling sites, but in general the species richness was higher during the dry season while abundance was higher during the wet season. This seasonal diversity pattern differs from the most common patterns recorded for savannas in other parts of the world. The species composition also changed in wet and dry seasons and correlated significantly with temperature and relative humidity. Our results suggest that the alpha diversity of the Amazonian savannas in our sampling area is lower than that in nearby rain forests and similar to that in agriculturally disturbed areas surrounded by rain forests. However, the species composition differed considerably from natural and disturbed areas. These results highlight the need of basic biodiversity surveys of insects in Amazonian savannas.'

Abstract: 'We studied spatial and temporal patterns in fish species composition and diversity at the upper Juru\xc3\xa1 River located in the west Brazilian Amazon. We collected with gillnet 822 fishes belonging to 90 species in the main Juru\xc3\xa1 River, its tributaries and the floodplain lakes during wet and dry seasons. Fish abundance and species richness were greater in the dry season. During that season, fishes may be concentrated due to the low water level, being caught more easily by gillnets. There has been a trend towards a greater fish biomass caught in lakes. This might be associated with a greater environmental stability as lakes may be less subject to large variations in water level. The fish communities differed between the two seasons and between lakes and the lotic environments (main river and tributaries). Fish species from the family Curimatidae were most abundant in the lakes, while Pimelodus spp. and Hypostomus spp. predominated in the main Juru\xc3\xa1 River. Seasonal variations in fish communities may be related to differences in the migratory behavior among fish species. Such spatial and temporal patterns influencing fish community structure at the Upper Juru\xc3\xa1 Extractive Reserve must be accounted for in management and conservation strategies.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the influence of edge effects on communities of galling insects in the Brazilian Amazon. For this, were performed data analyses comparing the galling richness between disturbed and undisturbed areas, and subsequently evaluated the richness of galling at different distances from the forest edge. We registered 194 galling insect morphotypes in 116 host plant species. Galling insect richness was more pronounced in disturbed areas and closer to the forest edge, both to community in general as to specific host plant taxa. These results indicate positive responses of galling insect richness to edge effects in forest environments. Edge effect could influence the galling distribution in modified habitats because increases the stress conditions of the plants and decreases the attack pressure of natural enemies.'

Abstract: 'The Peruvian government seeks to stop deforestation in its primary forest in the Amazon. It alleges that the main culprit of deforestation is smallholders who practice swidden farming. However, this is a simplified view, concealing the main reasons for deforestation and the complexity of land use changes. By studying land and forest use through the lens of the indigenous Kechwa-Lamas people, who live along forest covered mountain slopes in the region San Mart\xc3\xadn, we attempt to show the complex and intertwined reasons for deforestation, as well as how the indigenous people try to cope with this development. We identify and discuss three \xe2\x80\x9cideal\xe2\x80\x9d types of land use\xe2\x80\x94the swidden and tree based systems of the Kechwa-Lamas people, agricultural intensification practices (particularly perennial cash crops), and state conservation approaches. In practice these uses overlap spatially and have synergistic and antagonistic aspects. Kechwa-Lamas may clear land for tree cash crops, but they also manage forests and seek to conserve them for particular needs. Migrants from the Andes clear forests to plant perennial crops, penetrating the ancestral territories of the Kechwa-Lamas, while large scale capital intensive agriculture often intrudes into primary forest and jeopardizes existing subsistence systems. The opening up of forest areas in San Mart\xc3\xadn and its gradual integration into the nation\xe2\x80\x99s market economy, together with the local government\xe2\x80\x99s division of the region into zones intended for different purposes, have had both intended and unintended consequences. There is a need to develop a more nuanced understanding of the forms and complexity of forests and their transitions, particularly where secondary and managed forests replace previous rainforest areas. The findings draw on field observations and interviews with households, key NGO informants and a detailed case study of 13 Kechwa-Lamas villages.'

Abstract: 'Nitrogen fixation by periphyton and plankton was measured on the Amazon flood-plain using the acetylene reduction method calibrated with15N-N2. The average ratio (\xc2\xb1 SD) of moles C2H4 reduced per mole N2-N fixed was 3.4 \xc2\xb1 0.7, similar to other studies. Periphyton and plankton had high rates of light-dependent nitrogen fixation, with dark nitrogen fixation averaging 26% of the average rates in the light. The average daily (24 h) rates for periphyton nitrogen fixation in 1989 and 1990 were 1.79 and 0.51 mmol N2-N\xc2\xb7m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921 respectively, which are comparable to summer rates in many temperate cyanobacterial assemblages. Nitrogen fixation was depressed at N03\xe2\x88\x92 concentrations as low as 0.5 \xce\xbcM, and was below detection limits at concentrations of 4 \xce\xbcM, which occurred during periods of river flooding. Planktonic nitrogen fixation rates were high (0.5\xe2\x80\x930.8 mmol N2-N\xc2\xb7m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921) during the high-water and drainage phases of the annual hydrograph when the floodplain waters were draining towards the river (low NO3\xe2\x88\x92), but rates were undetectable (< 0.05 mmol N2-N\xc2\xb7m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921) when there was river flooding (high NO3\xe2\x88\x92). Nitrogen fixation by periphyton and plankton in 1989\xe2\x80\x931990 accounted for approximately 8% of previously reported total annual nitrogen inputs to the floodplain at Lake Calado.'

Abstract: 'During 2009 the Amazon basin was hit by a heavy flooding with a magnitude and duration few times observed in several decades. Torrential rain in northern and eastern Amazonia during the austral summer of 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 swelled the Amazon River and its tributaries. By July 2009, water levels of the Rio Negro, a major Amazon tributary, reached at Manaus harbor a new record, the highest mark of the last 107\xc2\xa0years. During the 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 hydrological year, the rainy season on northern and northwestern Amazonia started prematurely, and was followed by a longer-than-normal rainy season. An anomalously southward migration of the ITCZ during May\xe2\x80\x93June 2009, due to the warmer than normal surface waters in the tropical South Atlantic, was responsible for abundant rainfall in large regions of eastern Amazonia and Northeast Brazil from May to July 2009. We also compared the flood of 2009 with other major events recorded in 1989 and 1999. The hydrological consequences of this pattern were earlier than normal floods in Amazon northern tributaries, which peak discharges at their confluences with the main stem almost coincided with the peaks of southern tributaries. Since the time displacement of the contribution to the main stem of northern and southern Amazon tributaries is fundamental for damping flood waves in the main stem, the simultaneous combinations of peak discharges of tributaries resulted in an extreme flood.'

Abstract: 'Daily dietary intake of Hg and some essential elements in diets of children from communities in the Ja\xc3\xba National Park, Amazon region, were assessed. Diet samples were analyzed for total Hg content using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry and Ca, Fe, K, Na, Se and Zn contents by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The weekly tolerable provisional intake for Hg in the communities studied varied from 13 to 57 mg of Hg per kg of body weight, exceeding the limit of 5 mg . kg-1 set by the WHO. Comparison of the daily dietary intake values to the new Dietary Reference Intakes (4-8 years), showed prevalence of inadequacy.'

Abstract: 'The regulation of the Jamari River advanced peak floods by 1\xe2\x80\x932 months and increased dry-season discharges from 60 to 200 m3 s\xe2\x88\x921, resulting in water levels approximately 1 m above those recorded before regulation. Daily variation in water level associated with fluctuations in electricity production by the dam propagated to the lower reaches of the tributary Candeias River. Dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, and conductivity measured over 1.5 years on three locations along the regulated and two free-flowing rivers indicated important alterations in the case of oxygen concentrations. DO levels shifted from saturated (7\xe2\x80\x938 mg l\xe2\x88\x921) during the flood season (when the spillways were open releasing epilimnetic water) to hypoxic (1.5\xe2\x80\x933 mg l\xe2\x88\x921) during the dry season (when the floodgates were closed and only hypolimnetic water used to run the turbines was feeding the river). Fluctuations in water level and variation in dissolved oxygen tended to be greater at the site closest to the dam, gradually attenuating downstream. Mitigation of the downstream effects of river regulation would require modifications in the operation of the dam.'

Abstract: 'Brazilian officials have recently announced that, after a five year lull, deforestation rates are again on the rise in the Legal Amazon (INPE 2011). While this may come as no surprise to some, it is still useful to examine the conditions which have led to the unexpected success by the authorities in reducing deforestation over the previous 5\xc2\xa0years. The more so in that these years were characterized by rising agricultural commodity prices, usually a key driver in deforestation dynamics. We argue here that, despite the strong efforts by national and regional authorities to control deforestation processes a reversal of the trend was bound to occur as new policies were set into motion during the relatively quiet deforestation period to accommodate the economic aspirations of a growing population in Amazonia. Such aspirations were voiced in the National Congress, when deputies voted in May 2011 to relax the forest code laws. In a probable anticipation of such reform, an unambiguous upsurge in deforestation was observed in early 2011.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry systems (AFS) are important agricultural land use in synergy with socio-environmental aspects, especially with cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) crop, a commodity mainly produced by smallholders in the humid tropics. In southern Par\xc3\xa1, Brazilian Amazon, farmers manage native shade trees growing with cacao, but species selection may be not appropriate to AFS maintenance over time. The objective of this study was to understand the shade trees transition between successional management phases of cacao-AFS, considering its initial shade (IS) and secondary shade (SS). It was sampled 10 plots in each situation (20,000\xc2\xa0m2 in total) identifying individuals with CBH\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x8915\xc2\xa0cm. As expected, floristic composition was different and SS had greater species richness and diversity than IS, where only 17% of species were the shared among them. Musa sp. and Carica papaya L. were found only in IS and were dominant species, representing almost a half of the individuals. Although there was increase of late succession species from IS to SS, this still keeps high abundance of early succession species, such as Cecropia sp. The result shows an unexploited potential products and gap of services provision, such as N-fixing. The conclusion highlights the necessity of long-term succession planning and management practices to guarantee cacao crop maintenance and improve diversification with other income sources, such as fruits and wood. The role of biodiversity conservation, provided by shade trees, should be the target of political strategies to encourage its maintenance, such as payment for ecosystems services or other economic incentives.'

Abstract: 'The ants Pheidole minutula and Crematogaster sp. are obligate inhabitants of the ant-plant Maieta guianensis. They nest and reproduce exclusively in this and a few other Amazon melastome ant-plants. Experimental transplants of uncolonized M. guianensis seedlings to sites at different distances from established colonies of these two ant species, which are sources of founding queens, have shown that distance is an important factor affecting seedling colonization by ants. The proportion of colonized seedlings and the average number of colonizations per seedling, both by Crematogaster sp. and P. minutula, decreased as distance from established colonies increased. Seedling colonization was also affected by rainfall and fewer seedlings were colonized during the dry season, especially by P. minutula, than during the rainy season. P. minutula queens usually cooperate with each other during colony foundation, a behaviour not observed among founding queens of Crematogaster sp. Competition between these two ant species for host-plants appears to be strong as 63.6% of the seedlings colonized by Crematogaster sp. were also colonized by P. minutula during a 15-month observational period. However, there was generally an interval of a few months between colonizations, possibly giving the first species to colonize the plant a better chance of domination on this plant.'

Abstract: 'Patients\xe2\x80\x99 adherence to malaria treatment is a key issue in malaria control and elimination efforts. Previous studies have reported on problems with adherence to anti-malarials, which in part can be related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of anti-malarials. However, there has been a relative inattention to the cultural and social aspects of these anti-malarial side-effects and, more broadly, to how cultural representations of body functions may affect people\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour. In this article, an in-depth analysis is presented of the cultural logics underlying local interpretations of adverse drug reactions to anti-malarials in the Peruvian Amazon.'

Abstract: 'Aquatic herbaceous macrophytes contribute significantly to the input carbon for the Amazon floodplain. These plants have large seasonal variations in areal coverage and high productivity. The present study estimates annual net primary production (NPP) of aquatic herbaceous macrophytes in a large lake on the eastern Amazon floodplain, assesses the sources and amount of uncertainty associated with these measures, and offers a comparison among the estimates of herbaceous macrophyte productivity in the Amazon region. Plant biomass accumulated during the rising water stage of the annual flood cycle, peaking at 2300 to 6100 g m\xe2\x88\x922 and decreasing later in the year. Annual net primary production was estimated to range from 2400 to 3500 g m\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921, with above water production between 650 and 1100 g m\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921, and below water production between 1700 and 2600 g m\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921. Echinochloa polystachya and Paspalum fasciculatum were the most productive species, followed by Paspalum repens, Hymenachne amplexicaulis, and Oryza perennis. The four main sources of uncertainty in the estimates were macrophyte taxa, location, sampling design, and lack of measurements of dead material loss.'

Abstract: 'Here we present the results of fungal biodiversity studies from some selected Colombian Amazon forests in relationship to plant biodiversity and successional stages after slash and burn agriculture. Macrofungal diversity was found to differ between forests occurring in two regions (Araracuara vs Amacayacu) as well as between flooded forests and terra firme forests in the Amacayacu region. Macrofungal biodiversity differed between regeneration states of different age in the Araracuara region. Suitable substrates, especially dead wood that occurred as a result of recent slash and burn agriculture, resulted in the formation of many sporocarps of wood-inhabiting species. Putative ectomycorrhizal species were found in a dipterocarp forest. Fifty two percent of the macrofungal species could not be identified to the species level, but could be assigned to a genus, and it is likely that a significant portion of these represent species new to science. Long term studies are needed to obtain a comprehensive and complete understanding of the diversity and functioning of mycobiota in Amazon forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Ayahuasca is a psychoactive plant mixture used in a ceremonial context throughout WesternAmazonia whose use has expanded globally in recent decades becoming popular among westerners whotravel to the Peruvian Amazon in increasing numbers to experience its reportedly healing andtransformative effects. The experience often involves participating in a shamanic dieta, which involvesfasting and ingesting non-psychoactive plants as well as a variety of plants for bodily and energeticcleansing in the form of purges and ritual baths. I demonstrate that the use of plants in this mannerconstitutes a technology intricately connected with Amazonian conceptions of the body and ultimately localeco-cosmologies that enrich our understanding of human-nature relationships and thus should form part offuture research or sustainability efforts in the area.'

Abstract: 'Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is indigenous to the Amazon region of South America. The river basins in the Upper Amazon harbor a large number of diverse cacao populations. Since the 1930s, several numbers of populations have been collected from the present-day Peruvian Amazon and maintained as ex situ germplasm repositories in various countries, with the largest held in the International Cacao Genebank in Trinidad. The lack of information on population structure and pedigree relationship and the incorrect labeling of accessions are major concerns for efficient conservation and use of cacao germplasm. In the present study, we assessed the individual identity, sibship, and population structure in cacao populations collected from the present-day Loreto Region, Peru in the 1930\xe2\x80\x931940s. Using a capillary electrophoresis genotyping system, we analyzed the simple sequence repeat variation of 612 cacao accessions collected from the Mara\xc3\xb1on, Nanay, and Ucayali river systems. A total of 180 cases of mislabeling were identified using a Bayesian clustering method for admixture detection. Using maximum likelihood-based methods, we reconstructed 78 full-sib families nested in 48 half-sib families, indicating that the pods collected in the 1930s were from 48 mother trees, maximum. Likelihood simulation also identified eight probable parents that are responsible for 117 pairs of mother\xe2\x80\x93offspring relationships in this collection. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and the Bayesian clustering method cohesively demonstrated a pronounced structure of genetic diversity, stratified by the river systems of the Peruvian Amazon. Our results also show that, in spite of the high level of allelic diversity in this collection, it was composed of a large number of related family members collected from a relatively small area, including a couple of sites in the Ucayali and Nanay rivers, as well as the lower Mara\xc3\xb1on river near Iquitos. The vast majority of the Peruvian Amazon, especially the upper Mara\xc3\xb1on River and its tributaries, have not been sampled by collecting expeditions. The improved understanding of the individual identities, genealogical relationships, and geographical origin of cacao germplasm in this collection will contribute to more efficient conservation and utilization of these germplasm. Additionally, this study also provides more baseline information to help guide future collecting expeditions in the Peruvian Amazon.'

Abstract: 'Climate scenarios for the Amazon region (Brazil) indicate an increase in temperature and a precipitation decrease, affecting society and economic activities, particularly small-scale rural communities. The research aims to identify, describe and evaluate factors present in sustainable development projects for small rural communities (Type- A Demonstration Projects - PDA and Alternatives to Deforestation and Burnt Projects - PADEQ), already implemented, for recognizing its potential use as strategies for adaptation to climate change for small rural communities in the Amazon region. The researches, concerning fifteen projects in Rondonia, Para and Mato Grosso States, were developed through document analysis, technical visits, and interviews with stakeholders of three projects about the community perception, vulnerability and adaptation capacity. The analysis of documents regarding the potential success of the projects highlights their short history, important in the local context, prospects for continuity, and community participation in decision making. Few activities developed in projects could be associated with climate change adaptation practices. Two strategies and practices are the most important: the social organization and the process of awareness and training of the community, and the diversification of the types and forms of agricultural production. The interviews indicate that adaptation is implemented in projects, but without considering the pressures of climate variability and change. While these projects were not planned in the context of climate change, the greatest role of the projects relates to the strengthening of the already existing adaptation capacity, creating good conditions for incorporation of new strategies and adaptation measures, now clearly associated to the objective to reduce the vulnerability to climate change and variability impacts.'

Abstract: 'The Neotropical region is renowned for its high biodiversity, and the Amazon River basin contains the highest number of fish species of any river system in the world. In recent years, habitat fragmentation and exploitation of biotic resources have threatened biological integrity and provoked to need for sustainable management and conservation of the Amazon River system. We studied 36 floodplain lakes along 2000 km of the Amazon River. The fish assemblages associated with flood forests are moderately diverse, with low species dominance and reduced populations. To detect nestedness of fish assemblage composition in floodplain lakes, a nested subset analysis was performed on species presence\xe2\x80\x93absence. The incidence matrix (species \xc3\x97 lakes) was maximally packed using the Nestedness Temperature Calculator software. The results of ranking lakes and species allow us to establish targets for conservation. Such strategy for sustainable management should be focused on maintaining the Amazonian biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Fires in humid tropical forests are increasingly frequent due to severe dry seasons, forest degradation and agricultural expansion. One agent implicated in current discourse surrounding tropical forest fires is the small-scale farming peasantry who rely on fire in swidden (shifting cultivation, slash-and-burn) agriculture. The environmental degradation associated with fire has led to government responses at multiple scales (international, national, state, regional) via policies aimed mainly at managing ignition sources. However, continued increase in forest fires suggests that these policies may be having limited impact and a fresh evaluation of current policy approaches to fire management is needed. We review fire policy measures with insights of caboclo farming practices and perspectives from Eastern Amazonia and examine the congruence between policy and practice. We demonstrate a significant disparity between policy requirements such as firebreaks and actual fire management practices, in which measures rarely meet requirements outlined in legislation. We explore the origins and the impacts of these disparities, focussing on smallholder farm-level management measures and local capacity. Incomplete knowledge coupled with marginal awareness of legal requirements served to propagate widespread erroneous beliefs in what these are. This analysis at multiple scales (international, national, state, regional) will contribute to developing greater congruence between fire policies and smallholder farming practices.'

Abstract: 'Most research featuring demographic factors in environmental change has focused on processes operating at the level of national or global populations. This paper focuses on household-level demographic life cycles among colonists in the Amazon, and evaluates the impacts on land use allocation. The analysis goes beyond prior research by including a broader suite of demographic variables, and by simultaneously assessing their impacts on multiple land uses with different economic and ecological implications. We estimate a system of structural equations that accounts for endogeneity among land uses, and the findings indicate stronger demographic effects than previous work. These findings bear implications for modeling land use, and the place of demography in environmental research.'

Abstract: 'Palms are a natural resource that has been abundantly used by Amerindians for centuries. Only a few palm domestications have been reported in the American tropics, where there is great diversity of the Arecaceae family. We report the results of a survey combining ethnobotanical and ecological methods to study the past and present management and distribution of palms by the Ash\xc3\xa1ninka indigenous people from the Tambo river region in the Peruvian Amazon. Our objectives were to document palm-related traditional ecological knowledge, to examine correlation between palm abundance and Ash\xc3\xa1ninka management practices and social exchange of palm resources, and to address the question of how the Ash\xc3\xa1ninka have modified palm diversity and distribution in their territory. We found that most palm species have multiple uses; the most intensively managed were palms that provide thatch, notably Attalea phalerata, Oenocarpus mapora and Phytelephas macrocarpa. Of these, Attalea phalerata was the most commonly cultivated and was found only in cultivated stands. Our results have implications for understanding the domestication of Attalea weberbaueri, which is a landrace within the Attalea phalerata complex. A closer understanding of this process would require morphometric and genetic methods to compare wild and managed populations.'

Abstract: 'The dissolved load of the Amazon River is generally considered to be lowly impacted by anthropogenic activities. In this work, based on the chemical and hydrological database of the Environmental Research Observatory\xe2\x80\x94HYBAM (http://www.ore-hybam.org), we explore the importance of the Peruvian Foreland petroleum activity on the dissolved Na and Cl fluxes of the Amazon River. The main result of this study allows us suggesting that oil extraction activity, concentrated in the El Tigre River basin, a small foreland watershed in the Peruvian Amazon, influenced drastically the Na and Cl exportation of the Amazon River during the 2006\xe2\x80\x932007 period. During these years, \xc2\xa0the dissolved exportations of this basin represented almost 20\xc2\xa0% of\xc2\xa0the annual dissolved Cl Amazon flux and almost 12\xc2\xa0% of the annual dissolved Na Amazon flux for a mean annual discharge <1\xc2\xa0% of the Amazon River discharge. Since the last decades, the anthropogenic activities are increasing over the whole Amazon basin, especially in Andean countries. In this context, our results demonstrate that extractive activity cannot be considered as negligible on the hydro-chemistry of the Amazonian Rivers especially for the weathering budget estimation based on river-dissolved loads. Moreover, Cl and Na can be used to trace the formation waters derived from oil extraction at a large spatial\xc2\xa0scale. The environmental impacts of contaminants associated with deep water released to the hydrosystem (polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons, metallic trace elements, etc.) at local and regional scales are still underestimated and should be monitored to map their local and regional influence and to prevent their risks on human health.'

Abstract: 'NO production and the rate constant of NO consumptionin soil samples from Amazonian forest and pasturesites were determined in the laboratory. The purposewas to study NO production and consumption in soilsfrom both types of land use as functions of soiltemperature and soil moisture. NO productionincreased exponentially with soil temperature. Thedegree of increase depended on soil moisture,indicating that the response of NO production to achange in soil temperature is most pronounced at acertain intermediate soil moisture. NO productionpeaked at a soil moisture of 0.10 g g-1, correspondingto 0.27 and 0.38 water-filled pore space for forestand pasture soils, respectively. The optimum soilmoisture for which maximum NO release was observedwas independent of soil temperature. NO consumptionwas most efficient at high soil temperatures andunder dry soil conditions. NO release wasapproximately 10 times larger for forest than pasturesoil. The difference may be related to the higherNO3- content in forest soil.'

Abstract: 'We compared the diversity and species composition and the structure of the vegetation of three distinct Cerrado phytophysiognomies (Cerrad\xc3\xa3o, Dense Cerrado, and Typical Cerrado) in the Cerrado\xe2\x80\x93Amazon transition, Mato Grosso (Brazil). Species richness (observed and estimated) in the Cerrad\xc3\xa3o and Dense Cerrado was higher than that recorded in the Typical Cerrado. Species diversity, based on a R\xc3\xa9nyi profile, was highest in the Dense Cerrado, in comparison with the other phytophysiognomies. We recorded a higher number of exclusive species in the Cerrad\xc3\xa3o and a greater similarity (Morisita and S\xc3\xb8rensen indices) between this vegetation type and the Dense Cerrado. While individuals were tallest in the Cerrad\xc3\xa3o and Dense Cerrado and lowest in the Typical Cerrado, there was no difference among phytophysiognomies in mean diameter. A gradient in decreasing species richness and diversity (hypothesis 1) and vegetation vertical structure (hypothesis 3) was expected for the Cerrad\xc3\xa3o\xe2\x80\x93Dense Cerrado\xe2\x80\x93Typical Cerrado; however, neither hypothesis was supported by the results. The Cerrad\xc3\xa3o and Dense Cerrado were most similar in species composition not confirming hypothesis 2, which predicted that the two savanna vegetation types (Dense Cerrado and Typical Cerrado) were more similar to one another than either is to the woodland (Cerrad\xc3\xa3o). Overall, the similarities among the three study communities depended on the type of parameter analyzed. While the species richness and the vertical and structure of the vegetation of the Cerrad\xc3\xa3o and Dense Cerrado are closely similar, the Cerrad\xc3\xa3o and Typical Cerrado are more similar in their species diversity. With regard to the floristic composition, Dense Cerrado occupies an intermediate position between Cerrad\xc3\xa3o and Typical Cerrado.'

Abstract: 'In spite of the existence of a vast body of information on the plant diversity of the Amazon, there remain significant obstacles to informed decision-making and management for conservation. Species distributions are poorly understood and the relationships between diversity and composition of vegetation, ecosystem services and resilience to climatic fluctuations are insufficiently clear. The geographic distribution of phylogenetic diversity in relation to current protected areas is unexplored and very little is known about intraspecific genetic variability and its practical significance. Interpretation of vegetation differentiation and distribution remains relatively simplistic; there are still large parts of the basin for which few or no botanical data exist, and many rare and sparsely distributed species remain undiscovered. Improved understanding of the ecological roles, dynamics and associations of the species of greatest importance for the maintenance of sustainable livelihoods and ecosystem services, habitat restoration and adaptation to climate change is a high priority. In many cases these are common and widespread species. Some of these issues are explored by looking at the Cristalino region in northern Mato Grosso as a case-study. Effective integration, quality assessment, synthesis and application of existing data on the plant diversity of the Amazon will help to address these issues. However, more targeted information is needed from the ground. Future prioritisation of research effort will require a careful and pragmatic balance between the \xe2\x80\x98traditional\xe2\x80\x99 focus on rare and endemic species and species-rich communities, and the growing need to understand the key \xe2\x80\x98framework\xe2\x80\x99 elements that will determine the future of the Amazon environment. Similar situations are faced elsewhere in the tropics: for botanical research institutes in the 21st century this demands an urgent re-evaluation of core activities and concerted engagement with the issues and challenges facing conservation in a context of rampant population growth, climate change and environmental destruction.'

Abstract: 'Twelve species of primates occur in the Amazon (Tapaj\xc3\xb3s) National Park. The abundance of these species varies with habitat type and extent of human disturbance. Seasonality of rainfall and river level significantly affect the abundance of primates in seasonally inundated forest but not in upland forest types.'

Abstract: 'The north-east of Par\xc3\xa1 state in the Eastern Amazon of Brazil was settled over 100 years ago. Today the region is an agricultural landscape with variously-aged secondary vegetation and fields with annual cultures, plantation crops and pastures. The effect of these different land covers on carbon sequestration as well as on water and nutrient extraction remain subject of debate. Therefore, we assessed the importance of land use on soil carbon stocks by measuring various C fractions and root biomass (0\xe2\x80\x936 m) in slash-and-burn systems and (semi-) permanent cultures. An extensive root system down to at least 6 m depth was present under various secondary vegetation stands and slashed and burned fields recently taken into cultivation as well as under a primary forest. Shallower rooting patterns were evident under (permanent) oil palm (4.5 m) and (semi-permanent) passion fruit plantations (2.5 m). Carbon storage in soils of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture up to 6 m depth (185 t ha-1) was not significantly lower than under a primary forest (196 t ha-1) but declined significantly under (semi-) permanent cultures (to 146\xe2\x80\x93167 t ha-1). Compared to above-ground C losses, soil C losses due to slash-and-burn agriculture may thus be small. This is an argument for maintaining the secondary vegetation as part of the agricultural land-use system, as the root system of its trees is conserved and thus C is sequestered also at greater depth.'

Abstract: 'Investigations of land use/land cover (LULC) change and forest management are limited by a lack of understanding of how socioeconomic factors affect land use. This lack also constrains the predictions of future deforestation, which is especially important in the Amazon basin, where large tracts of natural forest are being converted to managed uses. Research presented in this article was conducted to address this lack of understanding. Its objectives are (a) to quantify deforestation in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA) during the periods 1986\xe2\x80\x931996 and 1996\xe2\x80\x932002; and (b) to determine the significance and magnitude of the effects of socioeconomic factors on deforestation rates at both the parroquia (parish) and finca (farm) levels. Annual deforestation rates were quantified via satellite image processing and geographic information systems. Linear spatial lag regression analyses were then used to explore relationships between socioeconomic factors and deforestation. Socioeconomic factors were obtained, at the finca level, from a detailed household survey carried out in 1990 and 1999, and at the parroquia level from data in the 1990 and 2001 Ecuadorian censuses of population. We found that the average annual deforestation rate was 2.5% and 1.8%/year for 1986\xe2\x80\x931996 and 1996\xe2\x80\x932002, respectively. At the parroquia level, variables representing demographic factors (i.e., population density) and accessibility factors (i.e., road density), among others, were found to be significantly related to deforestation. At the farm level, the factors related to deforestation were household size, distance by road to main cities, education, and hired labor. The findings of this research demonstrate both the severity of deforestation in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon and the array of factors affecting deforestation in the tropics.'

Abstract: 'This study evaluated the water uptake patterns of a primary forest and of the savanna-like vegetation of an abandoned pasture in an eastern Amazon site. We used natural stable isotope abundance in the soil profile, as well as plots irrigated with deuterated water to determine time and depth of soil water uptake by plants in different functional groups. Natural isotopic abundance was not suitable for identification of depth of water uptake by plants, but experiments using labeled water were. We found that the label percolation rate in the soil profile of the forest was lower than that observed in the pasture. Fourteen months after application, the label peak was located at 1.8 m depth in the forest and at 3 m depth in the pasture. Isotopic analysis of sap water from trees and lianas in the forest during the dry season showed that trees acquired labeled water at a deeper level in the soil profile compared to that acquired by lianas. Depth of water uptake by lianas seems to vary on a seasonal basis. In the pasture the \xe2\x80\x98colonizer\xe2\x80\x99 shrub (Solanum crinitum Lamb.) took up labeled water only from the surface layer of the soil profile (\xe2\x88\xbc20%), whereas the most abundant coexisting grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.) acquired it from the top meter. None of the pasture plants were able to acquire labeled water after one rainy season when the label pulse was deep in the soil (>1 m deep). These results have implications for studies of forest water cycle in which the soil volume used as source of water for plant transpiration is still unknown, and for an understanding of plant succession in the forest regeneration process of abandoned pastures in the eastern Amazon.'

Abstract: 'In the southeastern Peruvian Amazon, artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is estimated to have released up to 300 tonnes of mercury (Hg) to the environment between 1995 and 2007 alone, and is claimed to be responsible for Hg concentrations above international thresholds for aquatic wildlife species. Here, we examined whether Hg concentrations in bat populations are potentially related to regional ASGM-Hg releases. We determined Hg concentrations in the fur of bats collected at three different distances from the major ASGM areas in Peru. Our findings from 204 individuals of 32 species indicate that Hg concentrations in bat fur mainly resulted from differences in feeding habits, because Hg concentrations were significantly higher in omnivorous bats than in frugivorous bats. At least in two species, populations living in ASGM-affected sites harbored higher Hg concentrations than did populations in unaffected sites. Because Hg concentrations reflect Hg dietary exposure, Hg emissions from amalgam roasting sites appear to deposit locally and enter the terrestrial food web. Although our study demonstrates that ASGM activities (and Hg point sources) increase Hg exposure in wildlife, the overall Hg concentrations reported here are relatively low. The measured Hg concentrations were below the toxicity threshold at which adverse neurological effects have been reported in rodents and mink (>10\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5g\xe2\x80\x89g\xe2\x88\x921), and were in the range of Hg concentrations in the fur of bats from nonpoint source affected sites in other latitudes. This study emphasizes the importance of considering feeding habits when evaluating Hg concentrations in bats and other vertebrates.'

Abstract: 'This study is the first investigation on seasonal dynamics of parasites component community of the Aequidens tetramerus from an Amazon River tributary, in Northern Brazil. A total of 239,2407 parasites were recovered from 92 hosts examined from February to October 2011. Such parasites included Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Tripartiella tetramerii and Trichodina nobilis (Protozoa), Dolops longicauda (Argulidae), Gussevia alioides, Gussevia disparoides (Monogenoidea), Digenea metacercarie, Pseudoproleptus larvae, Anisakidae larvae (Nematoda), Proteocephalidea plerocercoid (Eucestoda) and Gorytocephalus spectabilis (Acanthocephala). Ciliates were the most dominant and abundant taxon, while cestodes were the least prevalent. The parasites showed seasonal variation in their infection dynamics associated with environmental changes during the Amazonian drainage season, except the infection with I. multifiliis. The parasites community in A. tetramerus was also characterized by higher diversity, species richness and uniformity during the drainage season when compared to Amazon flood season. With the exception of T. tetramerii, these parasite species are new records for A. tetramerus.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Amazon is a globally important ecosystem that is undergoing rapid development and land-use change. Roads are a key spatial determinant of land-use conversion and strongly influence the rates and patterns of habitat loss and represent a key component of models that attempt to predict the spatio-temporal patterns of Amazonian land-use change and the consequences of such changes. However, the spatio-temporal patterns of road network development are poorly understood and seldom quantified. Here, we used manually digitised satellite imagery at multiple temporal and spatial scales across the Brazilian Amazon to quantify and model the rate at which road networks are proliferating. We found that the road network grew by almost 17,000\xc2\xa0km per year between 2004 and 2007. There was large spatial variation in road network density, with some municipalities having road densities as high as 0.5\xc2\xa0km/km2, and road network growth rates were highest in municipalities with an intermediate road network density. Simulations indicated that road network development within municipalities follows a logistic growth pattern through time, with most of the development occurring within a 39-year time period. This time period is similar to those of other boom and bust development dynamics observed in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the temporal patterns of road development will aid the development of better predictive land-use change models for the Amazon, given the key importance of roads as a predictor of deforestation in many existing models.'

Abstract: 'In the Southwestern Brazilian Amazon, the Brazil nut tree Bertholletia excelsa is the most conspicuous remnant element of original forest ecosystems in human-modified landscapes. They often exist in pastures that have very different environmental characteristics than forests. In our study, we surveyed the ant fauna of Brazil nut trees in forest and pasture habitats in the Southwestern Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (i) How do arboreal ant assemblages of Brazil nut tree crowns change based on habitat type? (ii) What is the contribution of forest ant species from Brazil nut tree crowns to ant assemblages in pasture Brazil nut tree crowns? (iii) What features of pasture Brazil nut trees lead to a greater number of arboreal ant species? We selected 20 trees in each habitat type (forest and pasture) and collected ant samples both at the soil surface and at tree crowns, sampling a total of 184 ant species. Species composition was primarily determined by sampling layer. We found that the number of ant species was 63% lower in pasture than in forest tree crowns. The dissimilarity between the ant assemblages of tree crown and soil surface remained almost the same in both habitats. There was relatively little overlap in species composition in the forest tree crowns versus the pasture tree crowns, with species replacement component highly contributing to the differences. We conclude that scattered Brazil nut trees plays limited role on the conservation of its associated biodiversity in human-modified landscapes such as pastures.'

Abstract: 'The relation between fertility and cultural change in a Peruvian Amazon Indian village was studied initially in 1964 and in more detail in 1969. The 1969 study included observations concerning social, economic, environmental, cultural, and health changes. Population growth in the village is nearly 5% per year, and fertility appears to exceed that previously recorded for other groups. The factors that may be contributing to the high fertility are explored. They are thought to include early and prolonged parity, nearly universal marriage and fertility, high reproductive efficiency, short birth intervals, Western health intervention lowering both infant and maternal mortality rates, and a decline in the prevalence of polygyny.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon River runs nearly 6500\xc2\xa0km across the South American continent before emptying into the western tropical North Atlantic Ocean. In terms of both volume and watershed area, it is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest riverine system, affecting elemental cycling on a global scale.'

Abstract: 'Non\xe2\x80\x93timber forest products (NTFP) represent potentially sustainable economic alternatives for traditional peoples. However, exploiting NTFPs involves challenges, including successful insertion of products into conventional markets, accommodating legal or traditional\xe2\x80\x93use restrictions, and negotiating access to traditionally occupied territories. Some of these restrictions are due to the creation of conservation units. Here we present information on the effects of creation of a conservation unit on the viability of an NTFP\xe2\x80\x93extraction initiative by the members of the Artisans Association of Novo Air\xc3\xa3o (AANA), Amazonas State, Brazilian Amazon. Those artisans make vegetable fiber handicrafts using the leafstalks of arum\xc3\xa3 (Ischnosiphon polyphyllus \xe2\x80\x93 Marantaceae), which is common in seasonally flooded areas near Novo Air\xc3\xa3o. Conservation areas surround the town of Novo Air\xc3\xa3o and AANA members are prohibited from harvesting arum\xc3\xa3 leafstalks in these areas. In 2000, alternative areas for harvesting were suggested by environmental institutes, and management of arum\xc3\xa3 was concentrated along four rainforest streams close to Novo Air\xc3\xa3o. Harvest sites were monitored for three years, but there was no increase in growth rate as a result of harvesting, and leafstalk density did not completely recover between samples. High growth rates of arum\xc3\xa3 leafstalks suitable for handicraft manufacture are found only in areas where people manage the tree cover, but these practices are not permitted by current legislation, even in areas outside conservation units. To obtain arum\xc3\xa3 using traditionally sustainable methods, AANA requires the right to work and manage forests in protected areas. The lack of regionally appropriate public and environmental policy has resulted in a major impediment to a sustainable and locally run development activity.'

Abstract: "In an ethnoarchaeological case study, we take a gendered perspective on the house as a locus of political life in Conambo, a village of about 200 Achuar- and Quichua-speaking peoples in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In this small-scale society, women and men engage actively in political practice in independent yet complementary ways, and the domestic context is a place where political life is conducted on a daily basis. In this article, the house is examined as a politicized context at three scales of materiality: the organization of settlement in the community, the spatial relationships in the house, and the scale of painted designs on pottery bowls used in the house. At each scale, we identify material correlates of women's and men's participation. Our goal is to bring attention to potential archaeological correlates of women's political involvement in past societies, to question assumptions about women's political lives and domestic spaces, and to expand the ways in which anthropological archaeology may contribute to understanding cross-cultural variation in women's and men's domains of power."

Abstract: 'Five samples of buriti oil from industrial and artisanal suppliers were characterized in terms of nutritional quality parameters (nutraceutical levels) and acidity. As a first screening, each sample was analyzed by titration, spectrophotometry and an HPLC method, and the results were compared. As expected, artisanal samples showed lower acidity and higher levels of carotenes and tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols). A blend of industrial and artisanal samples in suitable proportions was completely characterized in terms of analytical and physico-chemical properties, i.e., fatty acid composition, iodine value, partial and total acylglycerol contents, refractive index (40\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C), saponification value, unsaponifiable matter, acidity (expressed as % of oleic acid), peroxide value, phosphorus content, oil stability index, tocol and carotene concentrations. The results of the present study showed that buriti oil is a valuable source of monounsaturated fatty acids, and vitamins A and E. No previous work in the literature has analyzed buriti oil to this extent. The chromatographic method using HPLC was effective in qualifying and quantifying tocopherols, tocotrienols and carotenes.'

Abstract: 'Landsat TM scenes for 1985 and 1991 are used to produce a georeferenced map of land cover and land use for an area of the Amazon estuary inhabited by three populations of caboclos with distinct patterns of land use. This information is combined in a geographic information system with ethnographic and survey research carried out over the past 5 years to develop representative spectral \xe2\x80\x9csignatures\xe2\x80\x9d which permit measurement and differentiation of land uses and the detection of change even between small areas of managed floodplain forest and unmanaged forest, and between three distinct age/growth classes of secondary succession following deforestation. Implementation of these procedures permit the scaling up or down of research at different resolutions. Three distinct patterns of land use are examined with differential impact on the environment. Mechanized agriculture at one site has eliminated virtually all the mature upland forest and is now dominated by secondary successional vegetation. The more traditional system of diversified land use at the next site shows a subtle cycling of flooded forest to managed palm forest through time in response to the price of palm fruit and cycling in the use of fallow land. A third site, based on palm fruit extractivism, shows minimal changes in land cover due to persistent specialization on management of flooded forest extraction. There is little evidence that the community with the greatest impact on forest cover is any better off economically than the two communities which have minimal impact on the landscape. This study suggests how a balance between use and conservation in Amazonia may be achieved in floodplain and estuarine areas, and the effectiveness of monitoring these types of land cover from satellite platforms.'

Abstract: 'The intense environmental and social changes taking place in Amazonia make this a key area for health studies of populations transitioning to a cosmopolitan lifestyle and market economy. Caboclos are among those populations. They comprise the majority of rural Brazilian Amazon peoples. At present there is limited information about their patterns of growth and health. In this paper, anthropometric data on Caboclo children from three groups living in different environments are presented and discussed within a bioanthropological framework. Caxiuan\xc3\xa3, Aracampina, and Santana have a combined population of 1,069 people. Caxiuan\xc3\xa3 relies more on subsistence activities for survival and Santana more on commerce, while Aracampina uses both subsistence strategies. Compared to US children, Caboclo are generally shorter and lighter in all age groups. However, their weight-for-height is above the 50th percentile. In relation to skinfolds, age groups 0\xe2\x80\x932, 6\xe2\x80\x938, and 9\xe2\x80\x9311\xc2\xa0years present statistically significant differences among the three communities. Caxiuan\xc3\xa3 children have the smallest and Aracampina children have the largest skinfolds. While seasonal and environmental differences may account for some of the observed variation in growth and fatness patterns, socioeconomic factors also play a key role in the trends observed. Thus, an ecological model provides the best framework for explaining these findings. Caxiuan\xc3\xa3 children are small and thin as a result of their combined poor environment and limited access to cash, western goods, and health care. Aracampina and Santana\xe2\x80\x99s fuller access to such socioeconomic influences and richer ecology results in taller and fatter children. Understanding similar interactions between ecology and social factors will be fundamental to developing sustainable health initiatives among rural Amazonian populations.'

Abstract: 'Decomposition rate constants were measured for boles of 155 large dead trees (>10 cm diameter) in central Amazon forests. Mortality data from 21 ha of permanent inventory plots, monitored for 10\xe2\x80\x9315 years, were used to select dead trees for sampling. Measured rate constants varied by over 1.5 orders of magnitude (0.015\xe2\x80\x930.67 year\xe2\x80\x931), averaging 0.19 year\xe2\x80\x931 with predicted error of 0.026 year. Wood density and bole diameter were significantly and inversely correlated with rate constants. A tree of average biomass was predicted to decompose at 0.17 year\xe2\x80\x931. Based on mortality data, an average of 7.0 trees ha\xe2\x80\x931 year\xe2\x80\x931 died producing 3.6 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 year\xe2\x80\x931 of coarse litter (>10 cm diameter). Mean coarse litter standing-stocks were predicted to be 21 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931, with a mean residence time of 5.9 years, and a maximum mean carbon flux to the atmosphere of 1.8 Mg C ha\xe2\x80\x931 year\xe2\x80\x931. Total litter is estimated to be partitioned into 16% fine wood, 30% coarse wood, and 54% non-woody litter (e.g., leaves, fruits, flowers). Decomposition rate constants for coarse litter were compiled from 20 globally distributed studies. Rates were highly correlated with mean annual temperature, giving a respiration quotient (Q10) of 2.4 (10\xc2\xb0C\xe2\x80\x931).'

Abstract: 'In July 1992 the Rond\xc3\xb4nia Agroforestry Pilot Project (RAPP) was launched in two agricultural municipalities (Nova Uni\xc3\xa3o and Alto Paraiso) in the western Brazilian Amazon State of Rond\xc3\xb4nia. The purpose of the RAPP was to assess the conditions under which colonist farmers in the western Amazon would integrate agroforestry plantings into their small-scale farming systems and to assess the performance of those plantings over time. An experimental group consisting of 50 small-scale farmers was selected to participate. Plots were designed to accommodate between 3 and 25 different species, each producing one or more commodities with local market potential (hardwood, fruits, nuts, latexes, oils). Farmers planted seedlings typically on a 1-ha plot, located and designed by each farmer with the advice of a professional Brazilian extensionist. During the first phase of the project (1992\xe2\x80\x931998), the growth performance of the seedlings and changes in household characteristics were monitored on an annual basis. By 2002, 32 (64.0%) of the original 50 agroforest plots were found in place. This paper updates the research findings based on a 2002 follow-up visit to these 32 farms. In addition to growth performance, the authors\xe2\x80\x99 found that 17.95% of the farms in the neighboring control group had planted trees and other agroforest crops between 1992 and 2002, compared to only 5.38% of farms outside the project area, suggesting spontaneous diffusion. The authors also found a potentially synergistic relationship between agroforestry and secondary forest regeneration with the use of satellite image analysis. The experience of the RAPP indicates that colonist farmers in Amazonia can be successful managers of agroforest plots with minimal external inputs over the long-term (10\xc2\xa0years).'

Abstract: 'In Brazil, 99% of the cases of malaria are concentrated in the Amazon region, with high level of transmission. The objectives of the study were to use geographic information systems (GIS) analysis and logistic regression as a tool to identify and analyse the relative likelihood and its socio-environmental determinants of malaria infection in the Vale do Amanhecer rural settlement, Brazil.'

Abstract: 'This descriptive study identifies patterns of land use among small farmer settlers in the Northeastern Ecuadorian Amazon using cross-sectional data collected among approximately 400 households in 1990. A \xe2\x80\x9ctypology\xe2\x80\x9d of land use patterns is built and considered in relation to two household characteristics: duration of settlement and labor. Several variations in land use patterns are identified according to the degree of forest clearing they involve. Findings suggest that most settlers reflect a low cleared area pattern which may be related to a \xe2\x80\x9cbrake\xe2\x80\x9d family-based coffee production cleared and places on the area cultivated. Reducing clearing by settlers already in the region may therefore mean reinforcing what most are already doing. However, since lower welfare may be associated with lower cleared areas patterns, reinforcing their use will involve making them more profitable. Improving the well-being of the human as well as natural resources of the Amazon frontier will inevitably entail policy measures which reconcile the needs of settler households with forest conservation.'

Abstract: 'Aboveground carbon dynamics were estimated in two strips (30\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0150\xc2\xa0m) clear-cut in the Peruvian Amazon following 15\xc2\xa0years after clearing. While strip 1 recovered 50\xc2\xa0% (64\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) of its pre-clearing carbon stocks, the clear-cut portion of strip 2 recovered 39\xc2\xa0% (53\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). During this period, there were high carbon sequestration rates (>6\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) from tree growth and low carbon emission rates from tree mortality (up to 3\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) in both strip 1 and the clear-cut portion of strip 2. Recruits make up most of the tree composition in both strips, and therefore play an important role in carbon sequestration. However, there were high carbon emission rates from timber harvesting and processing (>20\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921). A thinning treatment, applied 7\xc2\xa0years after clearing, did not affect carbon dynamics. In the 15-year period total carbon emissions (+) were greater than sequestration (\xe2\x88\x92). Net carbon fluxes for strip 1 and the clear-cut portion of strip 2 were +26 and +68\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. Comparable carbon dynamics were found in the deferment-cut treatment, applied to the south half of strip 2. To conclude, the 15\xc2\xa0year-old clear-cut strips are not carbon sinks yet, and will require >140\xc2\xa0years to reach old-growth carbon stocks.'

Abstract: 'This study focuses on the documentation of traditional plant usage among Kichwa, the indigenous people from Canton Loreto, Ecuador. The relationship between people, plants and the natural environment is demonstrated in an ethnobotanical garden at the Capacity Building Centre of the town. The construction site for the ethnobotanical garden is a 1.5\xc2\xa0ha secondary forest. The forest was analyzed with a local key informant and 150 different useful species were found. The plant species recorded are mainly used for medicinal purposes, followed by edible plants, and finally by food sources for animals. Open-ended interviews were conducted with the aim of identifying the most commonly used plant species among the Kichwas. The results showed that Ilex guayusa ranked most popular, followed by Myroxylon balsamum, Cedrela odorata, Banisteriopsis caapi, and Urera caracasana. Focus groups were held and the most important plant applications were evaluated. The collected data illustrated that Kichwas attach great importance to medicinal and ritual plants, followed by plants used for handcraft. Edible plants rank afterwards, followed by dye plants and plants used for hunting. The above findings serve as the backbone of the design for the ethnobotanical garden. The garden acts as a tool to preserve and promote the knowledge of plants, focusing mainly on medicinal plants. The growing areas for the plant species were determined according to their importance to the Kichwas. The concept of the ethnobotanical garden conveys the holistic picture drawn from the investigation on people and plants of the Kichwas.'

Abstract: 'In this study, a new host record for Dadaytrema oxycephala (Digenea: Cladorchiidae) is described from an important Amazonian ornamental fish. The parasite was identified based in the general morphology and surface ultrastructure of the young and mature trematodes using scanning electron microscopy. The digenetic trematodes were found in the intestine of 15 of 80 specimens (18.7%) of Brochis multiradiatus captured from two floodplain lakes of the Amazonas River, Department of Loreto, Peru and no clinical signs were observed in the parasitized organ. This is the first report of D. oxycephala parasitizing fish of the genus Brochis in the Amazon basin and the first to report this parasite infection in an ornamental fish from Peru. Given that international trade of ornamental fish is a major factor for transboundary spreading of fish parasites and taking account that Peru is the second largest exporter of the Amazonian countries, there is a fundamental need of constant monitoring for diagnosis and timely control of infections by digeneans in order to better prevent introduction in new environments, dissemination and future disease outbreaks.'

Abstract: 'Slash and burn practices affect tropical forests. Our results showed strong introgression between Inga ingoides and Inga edulis in the species contact area. Interspecific hybridization could be sought to improve yield and tolerance to flooding and further increase the economic potential of the poorly drained Amazonian soils and minimize deforestation.'

Abstract: 'Jaguars and pumas are the largest felids in the Americas. Information about these two species is scarce, especially where both species are sympatric. We studied the use and selection of macrohabitats, spatial segregation and kinship in jaguars and pumas in the Viru\xc3\xa1 National Park (Amazonian lowlands) by non-invasive genetic analyses of faecal samples. Seven different jaguars (six males and one female) and nine different pumas (five males and four females) were identified. We found space use segregation between the two species, with pumas using mostly forested habitats and jaguars using open habitats slightly more than the forested ones. This result is unexpected, since previous studies have found that pumas favour more open habitats than jaguars. The results suggest that jaguars use the areas in a more random manner, corresponding to the habits of a dominant generalist species, whereas pumas use the area to reduce encounter rates with jaguars. Nevertheless, both species mainly used areas near upland forest-flooding habitats. Some kinship categories were supported with a p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05 in 57 and 83% of the pair comparisons between the identified jaguars and the identified pumas, respectively. Non-invasive genetic analysis of faeces was useful to study the spatial ecology of solitary, rare and cryptic species in the Amazon.'

Abstract: 'The geomorphological analysis of the river Tocantins alluvial area was carried out by remote sensing techniques, jointly with studies of sedimentary facies, mineralogy and geochemistry, pollen and spores, C and N isotopes data and radiocarbon dating of a sediment core from a floodplain lake, near the river Tocantins in the southeastern Amazon region. The aim was to identify and discuss the relationship between the main geomorphological processes and climatic factors, as well as their influence on vegetation patterns. The data indicate three phases of sediment and organic matter accumulation associated with vegetation changes during the Holocene: in Phase 1 (>7760\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa080\xc2\xa0cal yrs b.p.), the channel was gradually being disconnected from its main course, accumulating organic matter from terrestrial woody plants; in Phase 2 (>7760\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa080 to 5145\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0175\xc2\xa0cal yrs b.p.), the very low energy flows allowed the deposition of autochthonous organic mud from suspension. Herbaceous vegetation and a Mauritia palm-swamp dominated the study area, followed by an increase in the contribution of freshwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the lake; Phase 3 (5145\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0175\xc2\xa0cal yrs b.p. until present) records the expansion of ferns and arboreal plants, and greater freshwater organic matter input into the lake with anoxic water conditions. The development of the studied lake occurred by geomorphological changes and the filling process of an abandoned channel according to hydrodynamics and vegetation changes which were probably influenced by climatic changes during the Holocene.'

Abstract: 'Although abrupt changes (i.e. thresholds) have been precisely defined in simulated landscapes, such changes in the structure of real landscapes are not well understood. We tested for threshold occurrence in three common deforestation patterns in the Brazilian Amazon: small properties regularly distributed along roads (fishbone), irregularly distributed small properties (independent settlements), and large properties. We analyzed differences between real deforestation patterns, and tested the capacity of simulated landscape with different aggregation degrees to predict threshold occurrence. Three 8\xc3\x978\xc2\xa0km sites (replicates) with more than 90% of forest in 1984 and less than 30% in 1998 were selected/simulated for each deforestation pattern. Thresholds were observed for fishbone and large property patterns, especially when considering the connectivity index, although threshold incidences were more frequently observed in simulated landscapes. The capacity of simulated landscapes to predict the exact threshold point in real landscapes was limited, even when considering highly aggregate simulations. However, the general trend in landscape structural changes was similar in real and simulated landscapes. Thresholds occurred at the beginning of the deforestation for mean patch size and at an intermediate stage, corresponding to the percolation threshold, for connectivity, isolation and fragmentation. Threshold behavior for connectivity index might suggest that the survival of strictly forest species will sharply decrease when the proportion of forest reach values <0.60, indicating that conservation efforts should be done to maintain forest cover above this limit. Significant differences observed among the real deforestation patterns, especially in patch isolation and number of fragments, can have significant consequences for conservation. The independent settlement pattern is, without a doubt, the least favorable of them, resulting in a higher level of fragmentation, whereas the large property and fishbone patterns may be less detrimental if connectivity among the remnant forest patches is preserved.'

Abstract: 'Population genetic structure and genetic diversity levels are important issues to understand population dynamics and to guide forest management plans. The Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.) is an endemic species, widely distributed through Amazonian upland forests and also an important species for the local extractive economy. Our aim was to analyze the genetic structure of Brazil nut trees at both fine and large scales throughout the Amazon Basin, contributing to the knowledge base on this species and to generate information to support plans for its conservation. We genotyped individuals from nine sites distributed in five regions of the Brazilian Amazon using 11 microsatellite loci. We found an excess of heterozygotes in most populations, with significant negative inbreeding coefficients (f) for five of them and the fine-scale structure, when present, was very small. These results, as a consequence of self-incompatibility, indicate that conservation plans for B. excelsa must include the maintenance of genetic diversity within populations to ensure viable amounts of seeds for both economic purposes and for the local persistence of the species.'

Abstract: 'The Aphandra natalia palm is a species of monotypic genus Aphandra belonging to the Arecaceae family and is native to South America, mainly in the western part of the Amazon basin in Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil. In this study, we determined the physicochemical characteristics of A. natalia fruit mesocarp, as well as its fatty acid composition, the total polyphenol content (TPC), lipophilic antioxidant compounds and total antioxidant capacity. The fatty acids profile was determined using GC\xe2\x80\x93MS analysis and TPC and antioxidant activity by Folin Ciocalteu\xe2\x80\x99s reagent method and by radical scavenging activity (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical [DPPH]), respectively regarding their oil. A high value of 57.92% of total lipids was obtained, thus it can be considered as new source of vegetable oil. The oil extracted from A. natalia mesocarp had a high oleic acid content (71.92%), which is a characteristic closer to the composition of olive oil than traditional palm oil. TPC value (83.57\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.84\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0GAE\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 of oil) obtained from A. natalia fruit pulp oil is similar to some olive oil varieties. However, its oil presents smaller antioxidant activity than olive oils usually have.'

Abstract: ' Fluxes of CO2 and H2O vapour from dense stands of the C4 emergent macrophyte grass Echinochloa polystachya were measured by eddy covariance in both the low water (LW) and high water (HW, flooded) phases of the annual Amazon river cycle at Manaus, Brazil. Typical clear-sky midday CO2 uptake rates by the vegetation stand (including detritus, sediment or water surface) were 30 and 35\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5mol\xc2\xa0CO2\xc2\xa0(ground)\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x80\x931 in the LW and HW periods, respectively. A rectangular hyperbola model fitted the responses of "instantaneous" (20- or 30-min average) net CO2 exchange rates to incident photosynthetic photon flux densities (PFD) well. Stand evaporation rates were linearly related to PFD. The major difference in CO2 uptake rates between the two periods was the larger respiration flux during LW due to the CO2 efflux from sediment, roots and litter. Integrated 20- or 30-min fluxes were used to derive relationships between daily CO2 and H2O vapour fluxes and incident radiation. The daily CO2 fluxes were almost linearly related to incident radiation, but there was evidence of saturation at the highest daily radiation totals. Annual productivity estimated from the daily model in 1996\xe2\x80\x931997 agreed closely with that previously estimated for 1985\xe2\x80\x931986 from a leaf-scale photosynthetic model, but were some 15% less than those derived at that time from biomass harvests. Both CO2 uptake and water use efficiency were comparable with those found in fertilised maize fields in warm temperate conditions.'

Abstract: 'The production of oil palm is expected to increase in the Amazon region. However, expansion of oil palm plantation leads to significant changes in the physical structure of aquatic ecosystems, mainly through the reduction of riparian vegetation that is essential for aquatic biodiversity. Here, we evaluated the effects of oil palm on the physical habitat structure of Amazonian stream environments and assemblages of Plecoptera and Trichoptera (PT), \xe2\x80\x8bboth found in these streams. We compared streams sampled in oil palm plantations (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa013) with natural forest areas (\xe2\x80\x9creference\xe2\x80\x9d streams, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa08), located in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. Our results showed that oil palm streams were more likely to be in close proximity to roads, had higher pH values, and higher amounts of fine substrate deposited in the channel than reference streams. Further, these environmental changes had important effects on the aquatic invertebrate assemblages, reducing the abundance and richness of PT. Nevertheless, the genera composition of the assemblages did not differ between reference and oil palm (PERMANOVA, pseudo-F (1,19)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.891; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.111). We conclude that oil palm production has clear negative impacts on aquatic environments and PT assemblages in Amazonian streams. We recommend that oil palm producers invest more in planning of road networks to avoid the construction of roads near to the riparian vegetation. This planning can minimize impacts of oil palm production on aquatic systems in the Amazon.'

Abstract: 'We explore the welfare implications of agricultural expansion in the Brazilian Amazon by comparing spatially explicit estimates of soybean rents and the value of ecosystem services. Although these estimates are generated from different datasets, models, and estimation techniques, the values are comparable, such that the value of ecosystem services is greater than soybean rents for about 61% of the total area and 24% of the area where soybean rents are positive if protected areas are well enforced. Based on the balance between the benefits and costs of conversion, failure to value ecosystem services reduces total social welfare by 7.13 billion dollars annually relative to an optimum. Policy instruments that internalize the value of ecosystem services via protected lands, land conversion taxes, conservation subsidies, or excise taxes can avoid much of this loss. Regardless of intervention regime, policy makers should be cognizant of the diminishing net benefits of converting natural ecosystems to agriculture. Realizing the final 3.8% requires the conversion of an additional 15% natural ecosystems to soybean production.'

Abstract: 'Since the 1970s the Brazilian Amazon has received over 1 million migrant farm households from other regions of the country, many of whom were attracted to government-sponsored frontier settlement programs that offered free tropical forest land. As a result, pressures on tropical forests have intensified along several settlement corridors throughout the region. Despite their importance as agents of landscape change, surprisingly little is known about the land use practices of these farmers. This paper briefly reviews the research literature on smallholder land use patterns in Amazonia, describes the recent history of one important agricultural land settlement program in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia, and, based on 240 household surveys conducted in three separate settlement locations in the state, highlights key differences in land use patterns among the rural population. Typologies of farming systems are presented on the basis of cluster analysis of land use data and ANOVA tests. The findings indicate considerable complexity and heterogeneity in smallholder farming systems. Spatial variations in farming system types may be due to geographic differences in soil regimes, the social histories of specific communities, and site-specific responses to exogenous variables.'

Abstract: 'Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is a tropical rainforest tree that is indigenous to the Amazon region of South America. The myriad of river basins present in the Upper Amazon are where the largest diversity of cacao populations is found. Although it is generally accepted that cacao was first cultivated in Mesoamerica, there is evidence for domestication in South America, the center of origin. \xe2\x80\x9cPiura Porcelana\xe2\x80\x9d is a traditional cacao variety from northern Peru that is cultivated for the gourmet chocolate market. The demand for fine-flavored cacao used in high-end chocolates and the corresponding premium prices paid for distinct cacao flavors provide economic incentives for the use and conservation of these traditional varieties. In the present study, we compared the genetic identity of Piura Porcelana cacao with 11 known cacao germplasm groups existing in the ex situ cacao genebanks, along with the living wild populations from the Santiago and Morona river valleys in northern Peru. The results of SNP analysis showed that Piura Porcelana shares the same general population membership with the \xe2\x80\x9cNacional\xe2\x80\x9d cacao from Ecuador. However, Piura Porcelana significantly differed from Nacional (Fst\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.185, P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001), suggesting its unique genetic status. The high genetic similarity between Piura Porcelana and newly collected wild cacao suggested that the wild progenitors of Pirua Porcelana were from these river valleys, and this traditional variety could have been the result of independent domestication in northern Peru. These results provide new evidence of cacao domestication in the Amazon and will contribute to the sustainable use and conservation of these cacao genetic resources.'

Abstract: 'Low external input agroforestry systems hold great promise as alternative, sustainable production systems for small-to-medium farmers in the Amazon Basin. The design of such systems is considered essential to stabilize agricultural production and avoid the cycle of continuing destruction of primary forest [Anderson A (1990) In: Anderson A (ed) Alternatives to Deforestation: Steps toward Sustainable Use of the Amazon Rain Forest pp 3\xe2\x80\x9323. Columbia University Press, New York]. In order to be successful, these systems must be compatible with local ecological conditions and adoptable by farmers. Currently, many small-to-medium producers in the Amazon Basin use a slash and burn agricultural strategy that combines annual cropping with cattle grazing in mixed farming systems. While cattle play an important role in household economic survival, grazing-induced land degradation threatens the long-term viability of these farms [Loker W (1993) Human Organization 52(1)\xe2\x88\xb614\xe2\x80\x9324]. This paper presents a model of a low external input agroforestry system that incorporates farmer preferences and practices but uses well-adapted grass-legume pastures, rotational grazing and the management of natural forest regeneration to enhance productivity in an ecologically sound manner. This system provides farmers with the benefits of both annual crops and cattle raising, avoids the land degradation that characterizes current practices and effectively incorporates trees into the production system.'

Abstract: 'This paper describes a participatory mapping method field tested with agro-extractive settlements in the Bolivian Amazon. A regional transition from customary to formal property rights resulting from sweeping 1996 land tenure reforms has led to confusion and conflicts over resource rights, a problem compounded by recent high market prices for Brazil nuts. In response to community requests to clarify resource rights to Brazil nut trees, CIFOR offered to train community members to map trees, trails and other key features themselves. This experience indicates that local residents can map their resources in an effective and efficient way and in the process gather necessary information to mediate competing claims, demonstrate their legitimate resource claims to external stakeholders and make management decisions. We argue that maps and properties are more likely to be seen as legitimate reflections of de facto rights if local stakeholders are involved as a group from the outset.'

Abstract: 'Acute febrile illness (AFI) represent a significant health challenge in the Peruvian Amazon basin population due to their diverse etiologies and the unavailability of specific on-site diagnostic methods, resulting in underreporting of cases. In Peru, one of the most endemic regions to dengue and leptospirosis is Madre de Dios, a region also endemic to emergent bacterial etiologic agents of AFI, such as bartonellosis and rickettsiosis, whose prevalence is usually underreported.'

Abstract: 'The savanna formations of the Brazilian \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d present a high degree of resistance and resilience to the impacts of fire, although little is known of its forest formations. Given this, the present study evaluated the resistance and resilience of the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrad\xc3\xa3o\xe2\x80\x9d to fire impacts over a 7-year period. In March 2008, we established 50 permanent plots of 10\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0m and measured all the woody individuals with a base diameter \xe2\x89\xa55\xc2\xa0cm. Six\xc2\xa0months later, all plots were burned by an accidental fire. In March 2012 and March 2015, we re-measured all surviving individuals, and measured the recruits. Species richness, the density of individuals, and the basal area were all significantly greater (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in 2008, prior to the fire, in comparison with 2012 and 2015, after the fire. Species richness and the density of individuals were also higher (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in 2015, about 7\xc2\xa0years post-fire, in comparison with 2012. During the interval in which the fire occurred (2008\xe2\x80\x932012), the mortality and reposition time, and the stability were all higher (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) than during the subsequent interval, post-fire (2012\xe2\x80\x932015). The recruitment rate was also lower between 2008 and 2012 (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). Our results indicate that the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrad\xc3\xa3o\xe2\x80\x9d has reduced resistance and resilience to the disturbances caused by fire relative to savanna formations. Given this, frequent burn-off may cause drastic alterations to this phytophysiognomy, emphasizing the need for special care for the preservation of its biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'An analysis of decadal and long-term patterns of rainfall has been carried out using a combination of raingauge and gridded rainfall datasets, for the entire Amazon basin and for its northern and southern sub-basins. The study covers the period 1929\xe2\x80\x9398. Rainfall variability and variations in circulation and sea surface temperature fields have been analysed in more detail for the period 1950\xe2\x80\x9398. Negative rainfall trends were identified for the entire Amazon basin, while at the regional level there is a negative trend in northern Amazonia and positive trend in southern Amazonia. Decadal time scale variations in rainfall have been discovered, with periods of relatively drier and wetter conditions, with different behaviour in northern and southern Amazonia. Spectral analyses show decadal time scale variations in southern Amazonia, while northern Amazonia exhibits both interannual and decadal scale variations. Shifts in the rainfall regime in both sections of the Amazon basin were identified as occurring in the mid-1940s and 1970s. After 1975\xe2\x80\x9376, northern Amazonia received less rainfall than before 1975. Changes in the circulation and oceanic fields after 1975 suggest an important role of the warming of the tropical central and eastern Pacific on the decreasing rainfall in northern Amazonia, due to more frequent and intense El Ni\xc3\xb1o events during the relatively dry period 1975\xe2\x80\x9398.'

Abstract: 'Although studies have shown an association between air pollutants from anthropogenic sources and pregnancy outcomes, little is known regarding the association between low birth weight (LBW) and exposure to emissions of biomass burning.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon represents an area of 61% of Brazilian territory and is undergoing major changes resulting from disorderly economic development, especially the advance of agribusiness. Composition of the atmosphere is controlled by several natural and anthropogenic processes, and emission from biomass burning is one with the major impact on human health. The aim of this study was to evaluate genotoxic potential of air pollutants generated by biomass burning through micronucleus assay in exfoliated buccal cells of schoolchildren in the Brazilian Amazon region.'

Abstract: 'While the federal state of Amazonas bears the highest risk for malaria in Venezuela (2007: 68.4 cases/1000 inhabitants), little comprehensive information about the malaria situation is available from this area. The purpose of this rapid malaria appraisal (RMA) was to provide baseline data about malaria and malaria control in Amazonas.'

Abstract: 'The soils of the Brazilian Amazon exhibit large geochemical diversity reflecting the different soil formation processes in an area covering 49% of the Brazilian territory. Soil contamination by heavy metals is one of the threats to the sustainability of this Biome but establishing quality reference values (QRVs) for the region is a challenging owing to the immense territorial area of the Amazon. This study aimed to determine the natural background of heavy metals in soils from the southwestern Brazilian Amazon in order to propose QRVs for Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Zn for alluvial sedimentary soils. One hundred and twenty-eight soil samples were collected at a depth of 0.0\xe2\x80\x930.2\xc2\xa0m in sites with minimal anthropogenic interference. Soil sample digestion was based on the EPA 3051A method and metal concentrations were determined by ICP-OES. QRVs calculated for the southwestern Brazilian Amazon are among the lowest recorded in Brazil (mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921): Ba (16.5), Cd (0.1), Cr (6.9), Cu (2.8), Fe (15.4), Mn (13.4), Ni (1.7), Pb (4.4), Sb (0.9), and Zn (5.7). The low metal concentration is likely a result of the sedimentary origin of the soils. The results of this study can serve as a basis for defining public policies to investigate the environmental impacts resulting from changes in land use in areas of the Brazilian Amazon.'

Abstract: ' Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A. Juss.) M\xc3\xbcll. Arg., whose center of diversity is the Amazon basin, is the major source of commercial rubber in the world. In the 1970s, the need for new Hevea germplasm arose from the realization that there was a gradual erosion of the genetic variability of the rubber clones in many natural rubber plantations. This erosion occurred because most of the clones in cultivation were derived from the few surviving seeds collected in 1876 by Henry Wickham. Therefore, to broaden the genetic base of the major producers of natural rubber, it became necessary to undertake an expedition to the Amazon basin to obtain materials for the \xe2\x80\x98gene pool\xe2\x80\x99 in these populations. This expedition, called \xe2\x80\x9cGermplasm 81,\xe2\x80\x9d was organized in four stages. Initially, there was a 1976 seminar organized by the International Rubber Research and Development Board (IRRDB); then, in 1977, a Hevea workshop took place, also organized by the IRRDB. A preliminary mission by IRRDB officials to several countries in South America and the Caribbean followed in 1978. Finally, the Germplasm exercise by scientists from IRRDB countries (Cote d\xe2\x80\x99lvoire, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Thailand), China, and Brazil took place from January to April of 1981. A \xe2\x80\x98dummy run\xe2\x80\x99 to test the viability of seeds from Manaus, Brazil, was undertaken in 1979. The Germplasm collection covered three Brazilian states: Acre, Mato Grosso, and Rond\xc3\xb4nia. Collection teams traveled into the remotest parts of the Amazon rain forests looking for high-yielding and disease-resistant trees from which to collect seeds, budwood, and seedlings growing around the trees. Three teams collected a total of 64,256 seeds, 1413 meters of budwood, and 1160 seedlings. Following agreements with the Brazilian government, collected seeds were divided on a 50-50 basis between IRRDB and Brazil Materials for Brazil were retained in Manaus, while those for the IRRDB were initially sent to Britain for phytosanitary treatment and then to Guadeloupe for further quarantine in 1982, before being sent to Asian and African reception centers. Scientists who participated in the exercise had to undergo quarantine in a temperate country for at least one week before returning to their research institutions. This quarantine was an attempt to avoid the spread of the deadly South American leaf blight (SALB) disease. This disease has prevented Brazil from becoming a major world producer of natural rubber, despite attempts made by Goodyear and Firestone Rubber Companies, as well as Henry Ford in the early 1900s'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to examine how tree diversity, richness, and structural characteristics as well as above-ground biomass varies along a small-scale elevation gradient from 601 to 1000\xc2\xa0m above sea level (m.a.s.l.) in an Evergreen Andean Amazon forest and their implications in terms of carbon storage. Trees with diameter at breast height greater than 10\xc2\xa0cm were surveyed in 20 permanent 0.1\xc2\xa0ha plots, five at each elevation site. We determined species richness, density, basal area, aerial biomass and calculated a biomass importance value (BIV). The 1378 trees surveyed were mainly contained in the families Moraceae (17 species) Fabaceae (16) and Meliaceae (10). Species richness significantly increased (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.007) along the small-scale elevation gradient and was greatest in the range of 901\xe2\x80\x931000\xc2\xa0m.a.s.l. Aerial biomass varied between 246.8 and 320.9\xc2\xa0Mega grams per hectare (Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) and did not differ along the gradient (P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.579). At the highest tree density, the highest BIV of Iriartea deltoidea was found at 601\xe2\x80\x93900\xc2\xa0m.a.s.l. The disproportionate contribution of a few species, some being the least abundant but with high AGB in our surveys (e.g., Sterculia sp., Nectandra sp., Ficus sp., and Inga sp.) to carbon stocks is important to consider in furture research on carbon sequestration. As the production of above-ground biomass was concentrated in a few species, some uncommon, decision making in reforestation programs and how species should be selected may have implications when measuring and promoting carbon storage.'

Abstract: 'Local biodiversity can be expected to be similar worldwide if environmental conditions are similar. Here, we hypothesize that tropical ant communities with different types of regional species pools but at similar habitat types in Brazil and Indonesia show similar diversity patterns at multiple spatial scales, when comparing (1) the relative contribution of alpha and beta diversity to gamma diversity; (2) the number of distinct communities (community differentiation); and (3) the drivers of \xce\xb2-diversity (species replacement or species loss/gain) at each spatial scale. In both countries, rainforests and savannas (biome scale) were represented by three landscapes (landscape scale), each with four transects (site scale) and each transect with 10 pitfall traps (local scale). At the local scale, \xce\xb1-diversity was higher and \xce\xb2-diversity lower than expected from null models. Hence, we observed a high coexistence of species across biomes. The replacement of species seemed the most important factor for \xce\xb2-diversity among sites and among landscapes across biomes. Species sorting, landscape-moderated species distribution and neutral drift are potential mechanisms for the high \xce\xb2-diversity among sites within landscapes. At the biome scale, different evolutionary histories produced great differences in ant community composition, so the replacement of species is, at this scale, the most important driver of beta diversity. According to these key findings, we conclude that distinct regional ant species pools from similar tropical habitat types are similarly constrained across several spatial scales, regardless of the continent considered.'

Abstract: "In this report the state of knowledge of sediment transport by rivers of the Amazon drainage basin is reviewed. On an annual basis the Amazon river transports about 1200\xc3\x97106 tons of sediment from the South American continent to the ocean, which puts it among the world's largest rivers in this respect. The main source of sediment is erosion in the Andes mountains and this material is progressively diluted with sediment poor runoff from lowland draining tributaries. Almost half of the Amazon river transport is attributable to one tributary, the Rio Madeira (488\xc3\x97106 t/y). The Rio Negro, which drains the N crystalline shield, has a comparable water discharge to the Rio Madeira, but only contributes 7\xc3\x97106 t/y. In general the sediments in transport are about 1% organic carbon by weight and this results in an annual particulate carbon to the oceans of 13\xc3\x97106 t/y. Total carbon transport, particulate plus dissolved, is about twice this amount."

Abstract: 'There is only scant empirical field research that explores the structures of the wildlife trade throughout the world. This study describes the processes that take place before, during and after wildlife is traded illegally in Peru through the words and experiences of the actors involved. This analysis utilizes formal interviews (N\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8947), observations and thick descriptions in order to contextualize the processes of catching, selling, buying and rescuing wild fauna. Wildlife trade across Peru is found to be opportunistic and informal. The actors involved in this commerce are best described as ordinary citizens looking to supplement their low incomes.'

Abstract: "By comparing geographical patterns of old and new species with historical and ecological processes, interpretations can be made about time patterns of diversification. Such interpretations can form a basis for developing rationales for ranking biodiversity conservation priorities. The results of the comprehensive study of avian DNA were used to compare geographical distributions in Africa and South America of species of strong Plio-Pleistocene radiations and species representing older monophyletic branches. Striking patterns, some of them overlooked so far, were found. Most old species are widespread across a physiognomic and climatic domain, such as lowland rainforests, and therefore, are not specific conservation targets. In contrast, new species have evolved in well defined places with a special local environment, in particular in ecologically equable places inside geologically complex ecotonal regions. High species richness and taxonomic diversity, where maintained over wide areas by steady habitat alteration through patch dynamics, may be easiest to protect by general reforms that integrate regional development and protection of ecosystem services, rather than by strictly site-oriented projects. Areas of active speciation, although small, may have important regulatory functions and a critical role for maintaining evolutionary fronts'. The Tropical Andes Region includes a dozen such places. There is a congruence between the occurrence of old species which have relictual distributions and aggregates of limited-range component species of recent vicariance patterns, indicating that vicariance events take place mainly by isolation in extremely ecologically stable areas. Although these places do not necessarily have the highest taxic diversity, they should be top priorities for rapid and concentrated conservation action."

Abstract: "We examined species turnover in stream amphibians in rainforest in two hill ranges (Ashambu and Anamalai Hills) in the Western Ghats in south India. In each hill range, six stream segments (100\xc2\xa0m in length) belonging to three drainage or rivers were surveyed three to four times in three seasons over 1\xc2\xa0year. Species turnover (using 1-Sorenson's index) was estimated between all possible pairs of sites at three spatial scales \xe2\x80\x93 within drainage, between drainage and between hill ranges. Similar matrices were also developed for altitudinal difference and geographic distance between sites. A total of 30 species in four families were recorded from 3681 individuals. The hill ranges differed significantly in the composition of the stream community at both the species and family levels. Within the hill range, species turnover was correlated with altitudinal difference and not with geographic distance. Anamalai Hills had a greater species turnover than Ashambu Hills, both within and between drainage. There was also a high turnover between these two hill ranges, with only two shared species. This turnover explains the fact that only 30\xe2\x80\x9340 species have been reported from different hill ranges, although regional diversity is high with about 130 species. The turnover also predicts that several undetected species should occur in hill ranges and drainage that have not been surveyed. The conservation model for mammals and birds, consisting of a few large protected areas, may not adequately address the conservation requirements of amphibians. Protection of rainforest frogs may require many protected areas in different drainages."

Abstract: ' Bertholletia excelsa is the tree that produces Brazil nuts which have vast economic importance in the Amazon region and as an export commodity. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of Aspergillus section Nigri in Brazil nut samples at different stages of its production chain and to verify the toxigenic potential for fumonisin B2 (FB2) production of these isolates along with the presence of this mycotoxin in Brazil nut samples. The fungal infection ranged from 0 to 80% at the different stages of the harvest and processing chain and the water activity of the nuts from 0.273 to 0.994. A total of 1052 A. section Nigri strains were isolated from Brazil nuts and 200 strains were tested for their ability to produce FB2: 41 strains (20.5%) were FB2 producers with concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 37.25\xc2\xa0mg/kg; 2 strains (1%) showed traces of FB2, less than the detection limit (0.08\xc2\xa0mg/kg); and 157 (78.5%) were not FB2 producers. Although several samples showed high contamination by A. section Nigri, no sample was contaminated by FB2.'

Abstract: 'Mountain ranges are known to have a first-order control on mid-latitude climate, but previous studies have shown that the Andes have little effect on the large-scale circulation over South America. We use a limited-domain general circulation model (RegCM3) to evaluate the effect of the Andes on regional-scale atmospheric dynamics and precipitation. We present experiments in which Andean heights are specified at 250\xc2\xa0m, and 25, 50, 75, and 100% of their modern values. Our experiments indicate that the Andes have a significant influence on moisture transport between the Amazon Basin and the central Andes, deep convective processes, and precipitation over much of South America through mechanical forcing of the South American low-level jet (LLJ) and topographic blocking of westerly flow from the Pacific Ocean. When the Andes are absent, the LLJ is absent and moisture transport over the central Andes is mainly northeastward. As a result, deep convection is suppressed and precipitation is low along the Andes. Above 50% of the modern elevation, a southward flowing LLJ develops along the eastern Andean flanks and transports moisture from the tropics to the subtropics. Moisture drawn from the Amazon Basin provides the latent energy required to drive convection and precipitation along the Andean front. Large northerly moisture flux and reduced low-level convergence over the Amazon Basin leads to a reduction in precipitation over much of the basin. Our model results are largely consistent with proxy evidence of Andean climate change, and have implications for the timing and rate of Andean surface uplift.'

Abstract: 'Measurements of brightness temperatures from Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) temperature sounding instruments onboard NOAA Polarorbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) have been extensively used for studying atmospheric temperature trends over the past several decades. Intersensor biases, orbital drifts and diurnal variations of atmospheric and surface temperatures must be considered before using a merged long-term time series of AMSU-A measurements from NOAA-15, -18, -19 and MetOp-A.We study the impacts of the orbital drift and orbital differences of local equator crossing times (LECTs) on temperature trends derivable from AMSU-A using near-nadir observations from NOAA-15, NOAA-18, NOAA-19, and MetOp-A during 1998\xe2\x80\x932014 over the Amazon rainforest. The double difference method is firstly applied to estimation of inter-sensor biases between any two satellites during their overlapping time period. The inter-calibrated observations are then used to generate a monthly mean diurnal cycle of brightness temperature for each AMSU-A channel. A diurnal correction is finally applied each channel to obtain AMSU-A data valid at the same local time. Impacts of the inter-sensor bias correction and diurnal correction on the AMSU-A derived long-term atmospheric temperature trends are separately quantified and compared with those derived from original data. It is shown that the orbital drift and differences of LECTamong different POESs induce a large uncertainty in AMSU-A derived long-term warming/cooling trends. After applying an inter-sensor bias correction and a diurnal correction, the warming trends at different local times, which are approximately the same, are smaller by half than the trends derived without applying these corrections.'

Abstract: 'The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a major food legume cultivated by smallholder farmers in the tropics of Latin America and eastern and southern Africa. Acid soil and high temperature limit its production. Here we quantify differences in agronomical, phenological and physiological performance of common bean lines in order to identify promising lines with adaptation to acid soils and high temperatures in the Amazon region of Colombia. A field study was conducted using a 6\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x896 Alfa Lattice design with four replications consisting of 30 genotypes and one control genotype (Calima) which was repeated six times in each block (with a total of 36 plots) to cope with the spatial variability within the experimental site. During the growing period of the crop, maximum and minimum average temperatures were 32 and 23\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, respectively while the total precipitation was 933\xc2\xa0mm and the soil was acidic with aluminum toxicity. Differences in agronomical (grain yield, canopy biomass, number of seeds and pods per area), phenological (days to flowering and days to physiological maturity) and physiological (biomass partitioning, photosynthetic ability and pollen viability) attributes among the genotypes tested were quantified. The results obtained on the relationships between different plant attributes indicated that adaptation to acid soils and high temperatures is related to pollen viability, earliness, greater values of canopy biomass and better mobilization of plant reserves to the formation of pods and grains. Two common bean lines (BFS 10 and NCB 280) were identified as better adapted to the combined conditions of acidic soil and high temperatures in the Amazon region of Colombia.'

Abstract: "Adolescent pregnancies are a common phenomenon that can have both positive and negative consequences. The rights framework allows us to explore adolescent pregnancies not just as isolated events, but in relation to girls' sexual and reproductive freedom and their entitlement to a system of health protection that includes both health services and the so called social determinants of health. The aim of this study was to explore policy makers' and service providers' discourses concerning adolescent pregnancies, and discuss the consequences that those discourses have for the exercise of girls' sexual and reproductive rights' in the province of Orellana, located in the amazon basin of Ecuador."

Abstract: 'The analysis of the systematic transitions in the forested landscape and the study of the forest fragmentation patterns allow us to deepen our understanding of the changes in the vegetation ground cover. The importance of knowing the intricate patterns of the land usage of the upper basin of the Amazon region is widely recognized. This zone is one of the most diverse biological areas in the world, is home to large areas of mature tropical cloud forest and demonstrates high probabilities of stable climatic conditions in light of global warming. The research quantified systematic transitions through the \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgain\xe2\x80\x9d of the different categories of landscape during the eighteen-year study period of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (EAR), the forest fragmentation patterns were also analyzed based on a set of indicators. Therefore, with respect to the entirety of the landscape, the results registered for the ground coverage in forested areas during the first period (1990\xe2\x80\x932000), show a decrease of 6.99% and an increase of 0.68%; and during the second period (2000\xe2\x80\x932008), show a decrease of 3.99% and an increase of 2.14%. It demonstrated that forest and agricultural areas tended to replace or be replaced by herbaceous vegetation faster than expected fortuitously. Finally, the indices of fragmentation signaled intense changes during the 1990\xe2\x80\x932000 period with a reduction during the period 2000\xe2\x80\x932008. Percentages registered in the Largest Patch Index (LPI) were between 79.58%; 52.39% and 49.99% respectively; while the Patch Density (PD) varied between 0.04; 0.06 and 0.07. This suggests the propensity of forest cover to remain intact. The results of this investigation suggest a tendency towards stability in Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s Amazon landscape. Within the framework for development and management of this area, the tendency is natural regeneration. This permits a consolidation of the conservation, reforestation, forestation and agricultural forestry plans, programs and systems for the protected areas in EAR.'

Abstract: 'Land use change impact species richness and functional diversity (FD). In the Brazilian Amazon, we examined the impacts of oil palm plantations on orchid bee (Apidae: Euglossini) species using abundance and FD. We collected male orchid bees in oil palm plantation (PALM), legal reserves (LR), and riparian corridors (APP), and then we used morphological and life-history traits to characterize each species. We evaluated differences in bee body size by comparing intertegular span values. We tested the influence of habitat on taxonomic and functional parameters of orchid bees by applying a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA). We contrasted FD by calculating species richness, functional richness, and functional dispersion. We sampled 1176 bees from 30 species in 18 sampling days across 2015 and 2016. Males from PALM were 13.6% bigger than those in LR areas, and bees from APP showed a similar pattern compared to LR and PALM. Less than 15% of the variation in species composition was related to the distance among sampling sites, and 8% was due to habitat structure. In our pRDA, the spatial difference explained 6% of the variation in orchid bee traits, but there were no effects of habitat parameters upon FD. FD was reduced with land use change caused by oil palm plantations. Our findings support the belief that many bees are impacted by cultivated lands. Nevertheless, the functional similarity between LRs and APPs reflects common structural elements between them, although we did not find significant relationship between functional composition and habitat structure that we evaluated.'

Abstract: 'Measurements of brightness temperatures from Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) temperature sounding instruments onboard NOAA Polarorbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) have been extensively used for studying atmospheric temperature trends over the past several decades. Intersensor biases, orbital drifts and diurnal variations of atmospheric and surface temperatures must be considered before using a merged long-term time series of AMSU-A measurements from NOAA-15, -18, -19 and MetOp-A.We study the impacts of the orbital drift and orbital differences of local equator crossing times (LECTs) on temperature trends derivable from AMSU-A using near-nadir observations from NOAA-15, NOAA-18, NOAA-19, and MetOp-A during 1998\xe2\x80\x932014 over the Amazon rainforest. The double difference method is firstly applied to estimation of inter-sensor biases between any two satellites during their overlapping time period. The inter-calibrated observations are then used to generate a monthly mean diurnal cycle of brightness temperature for each AMSU-A channel. A diurnal correction is finally applied each channel to obtain AMSU-A data valid at the same local time. Impacts of the inter-sensor bias correction and diurnal correction on the AMSU-A derived long-term atmospheric temperature trends are separately quantified and compared with those derived from original data. It is shown that the orbital drift and differences of LECTamong different POESs induce a large uncertainty in AMSU-A derived long-term warming/cooling trends. After applying an inter-sensor bias correction and a diurnal correction, the warming trends at different local times, which are approximately the same, are smaller by half than the trends derived without applying these corrections.'

Abstract: 'A 210Pb chronology of sedimentation in a small floodplain lake in the Jamari river basin (Rondonia, Brazil) provided insight into the relationship between development and erosion in the Brazilian Amazon. Positive correlations between increased sedimentation in the lake and levels of deforestation and mining in the Jamari basin suggested a major increase in erosion associated with these activities. This increase in erosion could diminish agricultural yields in the basin and significantly reduce the useful life of a hydro-electric plant recently built on the river.'

Abstract: "In the absence of access to formal credit, informal contracts with independent investors give the small ranchers of the Lower Amazon an acceptable means through which to surmount the high investment hurdle of starting a cattle herd. These contracts \xe2\x80\x93 called sociedades \xe2\x80\x93 allow small ranchers to raise an outside investor's cattle in return for a portion of the offspring and are commonplace in the cattle production systems of the Amazon. But, notwithstanding a vast literature on cattle production in the Amazon, informal contracts have been largely overlooked. This paper presents the results of a field survey and financial analysis for informal contracts on small ranches in the Lower Amazon. In the results, we suggest that informal contracts are an important means of cattle herd start-up and herd production for small ranchers. Internal rates of returns in cattle production under these contracts are in the range of \xe2\x80\x937 to \xe2\x80\x9312% for the small rancher and 12% for the investor. The net present value of the contract to the small rancher ranges from \xe2\x80\x93R$1219 to \xe2\x80\x93R$8599 and from R$1681 to R$8845 for the investor, for a 10-year period, depending on herd size. Financial returns contracts are sensitive to the contract design \xe2\x80\x93 e.g., to who pays health costs \xe2\x80\x93 and to beef prices. The small ranchers have a negative IRR, lose money, and bear all the risk of loss, yet persist in using this form of herd development. We surmise that this is due to the non-financial benefits of cattle ownership and the lack of access to formal credit structures. In conclusion, although outside the formal economy and apparently financially unrewarding, these contracts are an important mechanism by which the small ranchers on the Amazon Floodplains create cattle herds."

Abstract: 'The possibility of adopting national targets for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from tropical deforestation in a future international climate treaty has received increasing attention recently. This attention has been prompted by proposals to this end and more intensified talks on possible commitments for developing countries beyond the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol. We analyze four main scientific and political challenges associated with national targets for emissions from tropical deforestation: (1) reducing the uncertainties in emission inventories, (2) preserving the environmental integrity of the treaty, (3) promoting political acceptance and participation in the regime, and (4) providing economic incentives for reduced deforestation. We draw the following conclusions. (1) Although there are large uncertainties in carbon flux from deforestation, these are in the same range as for other emissions included in the current Kyoto protocol (i.e., non-CO2 GHGs), and they can be reduced. However, for forest degradation processes the uncertainties are larger. A large challenge lies in building competence and institutions for monitoring the full spectrum of land use changes in developing countries. (2 and 3) Setting targets for deforestation is difficult, and uncertainties in future emissions imply a risk of creating \xe2\x80\x98tropical hot air\xe2\x80\x99. However, there are proposals that may sufficiently deal with this, and these proposals may also have the advantage of making the targets more attractive, politically speaking. Moreover, we conclude that while a full carbon accounting system will likely be politically unacceptable for tropical countries, the current carbon accounting system should be broadened to include forest degradation in order to safeguard environmental integrity. (4) Doubts can be cast over the possible effect a climate regime alone will have on deforestation rates, though little thorough analysis of this issue has been made.'

Abstract: 'Large-scale patterns of Amazonian biodiversity have until now been obscured by a sparse and scattered inventory record. Here we present the first comprehensive spatial model of tree \xce\xb1-diversity and tree density in Amazonian rainforests, based on the largest-yet compilation of forest inventories and bolstered by a spatial interpolation technique that allows us to estimate diversity and density in areas that have never been inventoried. These data were then compared to continent-wide patterns of rainfall seasonality. We find that dry season length, while only weakly correlated with average tree \xce\xb1-diversity, is a strong predictor of tree density and of maximum tree \xce\xb1-diversity. The most diverse forests for any given DSL are concentrated in a narrow latitudinal band just south of the equator, while the least diverse forests for any given DSL are found in the Guayana Shield and Amazonian Bolivia. Denser forests are more diverse than sparser forests, even when we used a measure of diversity that corrects for sample size. We propose that rainfall seasonality regulates tree \xce\xb1-diversity and tree density by affecting shade tolerance and subsequently the number of different functional types of trees that can persist in an area.'

Abstract: 'Agricultural landscapes of the southern Brazilian Amazon are the result of 80 years of governmental policies to install a powerful agricultural sector. Yet, this rapid expansion raised important environmental considerations especially with regard to deforestation. The agricultural frontier is thus now facing a huge challenge: to combine socioeconomic development with environmental conservation in the context of frontier expansion. Based on a conceptual model of the agricultural frontier, we review historical changes in environmental and development policies in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso and emphasize their ambivalent trend to both encourage and control the progress of the frontier. We then extend this model with an integration stage where environmental governance and economic development evolve from competing to complementary concepts. At this stage, the efforts to slow down deforestation are accompanied with programs to promote new agricultural practices and support industrialization. Finally, we put into perspective this recent evolution with regard to the underlying reasons for changing the agricultural model, thus considering the agricultural frontier to be at a tipping point where first positive results need to be confirmed in spite of an unstable economic and political situation.'

Abstract: "This article reports on findings of a research project examining farmers' coping strategies in the Brazilian Amazon in response to El Ni\xc3\xb1o related weather events. We examine the extent of vulnerability of small and large farmers to these events in a tropical rainforest environment. Little attention has been given to the impact of ENSO events in Amaz\xc3\xb4nia, despite evidence for devastating fires during ENSOs. Although we found a range of locally developed forecasting techniques and coping mechanisms, farmers have sustained significant losses, and we suggest that increased access to scientific forecasts would greatly enhance the ability of the farmers in our study area to cope with El Ni\xc3\xb1o related weather events."

Abstract: 'This study investigates the variability of convective properties during West and Central African monsoon season at both intra-seasonal and seasonal time scales based on 16-year Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) precipitation features (PFs). Three rainforests (west coast, dry, Nigeria\xe2\x80\x93Cameroon), two savannahs (Nigeria, Central Africa and South Sudan (CASS)), Sudano\xe2\x80\x93Sahel and Sahel were classified. Convective properties were grouped according to six intra-seasonal periods defined as pre_monsoon, active_mam, break_mam, active_jjas, break_jjas and post_monsoon. Comparison of West (rainforest zone: south of 12\xc2\xb0 N) and Central (savannah zone: south of 12\xc2\xb0 N) African mean convective properties showed that West African rainforest zones often have higher numbers of PFs and mean convective properties than the CASS savannah at all the intra-seasonal periods except during the post-monsoon period. The convective properties are more frequent during pre_monsoon, active_mam and break_mam periods than during the intra-seasonal periods of JJAS (June\xe2\x80\x93September) in the West African rainforest zone, and thus indicating the two distinct rainfall seasons in rainforest of West Africa, but this was not observed in Central Africa. Convective properties are found to have similar climatological pattern to precipitation climatology during March through May (MAM) and JJAS. Extreme cases of flashcounts (>\xe2\x80\x89275), depressed 85-GHz polarisation-corrected temperature (49\xe2\x80\x9365\xc2\xa0K and 65\xe2\x80\x9385\xc2\xa0K) and maximum heights (>\xe2\x80\x8917.59\xc2\xa0km) of the 30\xc2\xa0dBZ are frequent in the Nigeria\xe2\x80\x93Cameroon rainforest during MAM, but extreme system sizes (\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x8980,000\xc2\xa0km2) are found to be located in the CASS savannah zone during JJAS.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon River mainstem of Brazil is so regulated by differences in the timing of tributary inputs and by seasonal storage of water on floodplains that maximum discharges exceed minimum discharges by a factor of only 3. Large tributaries that drain the southern Amazon River basin reach their peak discharges two months earlier than does the mainstem. The resulting backwater in the lowermost 800 km of two large southern tributaries, the Madeira and Pur\xc3\xbas rivers, causes falling river stages to be as much as 2\xe2\x80\x933 m higher than rising stages at any given discharge. Large tributaries that drain the northernmost Amazon River basin reach their annual minimum discharges three to four months later than does the mainstem. In the lowermost 300\xe2\x80\x93400 km of the Negro River, the largest northern tributary and the fifth largest river in the world, the lowest stages of the year correspond to those of the Amazon River mainstem rather than to those in the upstream reaches of the Negro River.'

Abstract: 'Results-based funding (RBF) is a governance concept that is rapidly becoming the mainstream paradigm for international collaborations in the environmental sector. While portrayed as a compromise solution between market-based mechanisms and unconditional donations, the implementation of RBF is revealing new conflicts and contradictions of its own. This paper explores the application of RBF for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) by describing the discursive conflicts between recipient (i.e., Brazil) and donor (i.e., Norway and Germany) countries of the Amazon Fund about what constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cresults\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cperformance.\xe2\x80\x9d Although all parties agree that the financial transfers to RBF should be based on past emission reductions in relation to a historical baseline, they hold clashing interpretations about temporal (i.e., past or future) and epistemological (i.e., how to measure) aspects of the results these payments are intended for. Firstly, while Brazil emphasizes that it deserves a reward of USD 21 billion for results achieved between 2006 and 2016, donor countries have indicated an interest in paying only for most recent results as a way to incentivize further reductions. Secondly, while all parties believe that Amazon Fund should support policies to reduce deforestation, donor countries have revealed concerns that the performance of the Amazon Fund projects in generating further reductions has not been measured in a rigorous manner. This suggests that donor countries may consider making changes to current RBF mechanisms or getting involved in new forms of finance.'

Abstract: 'Land use and land cover maps and their physical-chemical and biological properties are important variables in the numerical modeling of Earth systems. In this context, the main objective of this study is to analyze the improvements resulting from the land use and land cover map update in numerical simulations performed using the Regional Climate Model system version 4 (RegCM4), as well as the seasonal variations of physical parameters used by the Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS). In general, the update of the South America 2007 land use and land cover map, used by the BATS, improved the simulation of precipitation by 10\xc2\xa0%, increasing the mean temporal correlation coefficient, compared to observed data, from 0.84 to 0.92 (significant at p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05, Student\xe2\x80\x99s t test). Correspondingly, the simulations performed with adjustments in maximum fractional vegetation cover, in visible and shortwave infrared reflectance, and in the leaf area index, showed a good agreement for maximum and minimum temperature, with values closer to observed data. The changes in physical parameters and land use updating in BATS/RegCM4 reduced overestimation of simulated precipitation from 19 to 7\xc2\xa0% (significant at p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05, Student\xe2\x80\x99s t test). Regarding evapotranspiration and precipitation, the most significant differences due to land use updating were located (1) in the Amazon deforestation arc; (2) around the Brazil-Bolivia border (in the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands); (3) in the Northeast region of Brazil; (4) in northwestern Paraguay; and (5) in the River Plate Basin, in Argentina. Moreover, the main precipitation differences between sensitivity and control experiments occurred during the rainy months in central-north South America (October to March). These were associated with a displacement in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) positioning, presenting a spatial pattern of alternated areas with higher and lower precipitation rates. These important differences occur due to the replacement of tropical rainforest for pasture and agriculture and the replacement of agricultural areas for pasture, scrubland, and deciduous forest.'

Abstract: 'Two ant species, Odontomachus rixosus and Pheidole annexus, were studied in the tropical rainforests of Sabah, Malaysia, North Borneo, to analyze the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity and population structure of ant populations using RAPD-fingerprinting. Ants were sampled in a contiguous (43,800\xc2\xa0ha) and three patches of primary rainforests of varying size (4294, 146 and 20\xc2\xa0ha) that were fragmented about 40\xc2\xa0years ago. We found a decrease in genetic variability for both species in the fragmented populations compared to the contiguous. Genetic distances between populations resembled the geographical arrangement of populations and can be explained by an effect of isolation by distance. A high degree in population subdivision suggests a lack of meta-population dynamics due to a shortage of gene flow between populations, possibly the result of the high degree of habitat isolation by oil palm plantations. Although the results of this study are limited due to low replication this is the first data on genetic patterns of insect populations in fragmented rainforests and should be seen as starting point for future research. The value of small to medium sized protection areas for conservation needs to be carefully evaluated in the context of this study, as even relatively large areas (4294\xc2\xa0ha) may not prevent the critical loss of genetic variability and guarantee long-term survival of organisms.'

Abstract: 'Within the framework of IWRM, a major concern in the humid tropics is the effects of \xe2\x80\x98global warming\xe2\x80\x99 on the storm rainfall-runoff hydrology of both forests and converted forest lands. Further how such effects need to be incorporated within adaptive, forest-water-land management. But since the mid- 20th century, dramatic changes in land- use (LU) and land cover (LC) have also occurred which have led to rapid rates of deforestation and an expansion of land\xe2\x80\x94forest degradation. How much these man-induced impacts have been influential on climate \xe2\x80\x93water relations, as against the effects of inherent climate variability and predicted climate change scenarios, still remains a major challenge to quantify. Thus embedded within the global warming issue are these additional LU/LC change impacts on climate-rainfall-storm runoff across scales which also require consideration under the broader mandate of \xe2\x80\x98global change\xe2\x80\x99. The work will initially succinctly summarize the existing uncertainties linked with both Global Climate Models (GCMs). Subsequently more detailed attention will be given to uncertainties linked with LC/LU change. The experiences of hurricane Mitch in Central America will then set the scene for an alternative strategy. A principle message is a call for more concentrated research effort on geographically the outer margins of the \xe2\x80\x98maritime continent\xe2\x80\x99 (centred on the Indonesian Archipelago) in the Western Pacific where tropical cyclone frequency is very high. This region presents a diversity of socio-economies and an opportunity to produce adapted forest-land management measures in preparation for future global change (warming and anthropogenic). Such measures can then be extrapolated to currently less frequently, affected areas from extreme events like hurricane Mitch. Examples from research in the tropical- cyclone prone, \xe2\x80\x9cWet Tropics\xe2\x80\x9d of northeast Australia linked with the management of tropical rainforests and the adjoining sugar cane lands are then used to demonstrate these opportunities.'

Abstract: 'Droughts associated with the El Ni\xc3\xb1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affected fishes of brackish-water lagoons, freshwater swamps and a rainforest creek in Suriname, South America. The mean rainfall in the period August to February in 22 El Ni\xc3\xb1o years was 76.6% of the mean rainfall in the same months of non-El Ni\xc3\xb1o years. In the period 1900\xe2\x80\x931999, three out of four years in which an extreme drought (rainfall less then 60% of the mean value) occurred were El Ni\xc3\xb1o years. The recent 1997/1998 ENSO event caused the second most severe drought in a 100-year record. Drying up of brackish-water lagoons, freshwater swamps and rainforest creeks was observed during El Ni\xc3\xb1o-related droughts. In the lagoons ariid catfish died first, followed by snook, tilapia, mullet and tarpon, respectively. Landings of lagoon fish were positively correlated with rainfall in the period August\xe2\x80\x93February. During the El Ni\xc3\xb1o-related drought we observed failure of reproduction in three species of callichthyid armoured catfish in both coastal freshwater swamps and a rainforest creek in the interior. In the El Ni\xc3\xb1o year 1997/1998, the \xe2\x80\x98no flow\xe2\x80\x99 period of the rainforest creek was extended by four months beyond the long dry season and the dissolved oxygen levels in the dry-season pools dropped to 1.27\xe2\x80\x89mg O2l\xe2\x88\x921 (as compared to 4.53\xe2\x80\x89mg O2\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921 under running water conditions). Other fish species of the rainforest creek also showed decreased reproductive success in the El Ni\xc3\xb1o year. We suggest that the stochastic effects of El Ni\xc3\xb1o-related drought may be an important non-equilibrium component in the ecology of neotropical inland fish communities.'

Abstract: 'A 200\xc2\xa0cm-long high resolution macro-charcoal and pollen record from the Lagoa da Cachoeira in Serra Sul dos Caraj\xc3\xa1s (Serra Sul) in southeast Amazonia reveals insights into local palaeofire over the last 26,200\xc2\xa0years. Local fires in Serra Sul were most frequent in transition periods from dry to wet environmental conditions between 11,000 and 10,200\xc2\xa0years ago, and under seasonal climatic conditions after 5,000\xc2\xa0years ago. During pronounced dry periods fires were not a substantial component of the environment in Serra Sul. An anthropogenic influence on fire in Serra Sul may have played a role since the beginning of the Holocene, but is not a likely driver of palaeofire variability. Charcoal records for southern Amazonia coupled with proxy data for precipitation and changing Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) suggest that Holocene palaeofires in southern Amazonia are driven by changes in climate.'

Abstract: 'Brazil currently contributes 42\xc2\xa0% of all malaria cases reported in the Latin America and the Caribbean, a region where major progress towards malaria elimination has been achieved in recent years. In 2014, malaria burden in Brazil (143,910 microscopically confirmed cases and 41 malaria-related deaths) has reached its lowest levels in 35\xc2\xa0years, Plasmodium falciparum is highly focal, and the geographic boundary of transmission has considerably shrunk. Transmission in Brazil remains entrenched in the Amazon Basin, which accounts for 99.5\xc2\xa0% of the country\xe2\x80\x99s malaria burden. This paper reviews major lessons learned from past and current malaria control policies in Brazil. A comprehensive discussion of the scientific and logistic challenges that may impact malaria elimination efforts in the country is presented in light of the launching of the Plan for Elimination of Malaria in Brazil in November 2015. Challenges for malaria elimination addressed include the high prevalence of symptomless and submicroscopic infections, emerging anti-malarial drug resistance in P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax and the lack of safe anti-relapse drugs, the largely neglected burden of malaria in pregnancy, the need for better vector control strategies where Anopheles mosquitoes present a highly variable biting behaviour, human movement, the need for effective surveillance and tools to identify foci of infection in areas with low transmission, and the effects of environmental changes and climatic variability in transmission. Control actions launched in Brazil and results to come are likely to influence control programs in other countries in the Americas.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia is a significant source of greenhouse gases today and, with almost 90% of the originally forested area still uncleared, is a very large potential source of future emissions. The 1990 rate of loss of forest (13.8 \xc3\x97 103 km2/year) and cerrado savanna (approximately 5 \xc3\x97 103 km2/year) was responsible for releasing approximately 261 \xc3\x97 106 metric tons of carbon (106 t C) in the form of CO2, or 274\xe2\x80\x93285 \xc3\x97 106 t of CO2-equivalent C considering IPCC 1994 global warming potentials for trace gases over a 100-year horizon. These calculations consider conversion to a landscape of agriculture, productive pasture, degraded pasture, secondary forest, and regenerated forest in the proportions corresponding to the equilibrium condition implied by current land-use patterns. Emissions are expressed as \xe2\x80\x98net committed emissions\xe2\x80\x99, or the gases released over a period of years as the carbon stock in each hectare deforested approaches a new equilibrium in the landscape that replaces the original forest. For low and high trace gas scenarios, respectively, 1990 clearing produced net committed emissions (in 106 t of gas) of 957\xe2\x80\x93958 for CO2, 1.10\xe2\x80\x931.42 for CH4, 28\xe2\x80\x9335 for CO, 0.06\xe2\x80\x930.16 for N2O, 0.74\xe2\x80\x930.74 for NOx and 0.58\xe2\x80\x931.16 for non-methane hydrocarbons.'

Abstract: 'In northeastern Par\xc3\xa1, extensive fallow-based agriculture systems are still common on smallholdings. Soil fertility is maintained by permitting the recuperation of the capoeira forest fallow. Much of the capoeira, however, has been eliminated, e.g. for permanent pastures but grass-monocultures usually ecologically degrade within a decade and lead often to barren pasturelands. To avoid these biologically degraded pastures, an innovative organic agro-forestry-system-model has been proposed, temporarily integrating pastures/cattle into the slash-and-burn cycle. The new approach assumes that cattle impact such as browsing and trampling would not alter the capoeira. This hypothesis was tested in researcher-managed on-farm experiments, by floristically comparing grass-capoeira pastures (GCP) against undisturbed capoeiras (UC) and traditional grass pastures (GP). Therefore, each pasture treatment was replicated three times on 0.36\xc2\xa0ha pasture plots, respectively. Cattle were introduced at a stocking rate of 667\xc2\xa0kg/ha, being reduced by one animal after 38\xc2\xa0months to 410\xc2\xa0kg/ha. Cattle impact was ascertained by comparing total capoeira phytodiversity, species similarity, life form structure, and vegetation cover. It was found that even intensive cattle impact on young capoeiras was neglectable and did not alter phytodiversity nor species composition. GCPs just showed a slight retardation in comparison to UC so that the botanical evidence of the ecological sustainability of a GCP could be proved. A PerMANOVA revealed that only 4.7\xc2\xa0% (F\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa05.513; R\xc2\xb2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.047) of the differences between GCP and UC are attributed to the cattle impact/slashing regime. Our preliminary results suggest that the biodiverse system approach is worth pursuing as an alternative to degraded pastures.'

Abstract: 'This paper argues that the process of establishing claims and control over resources, referred to as resource partitioning, structures frontier societies in ways which impede subsequent efforts at rural development. Conflicts over claims to resources create divisions among local elites which prevent the formation of coalitions to promote development. Struggles for control over the flow of resources out of a region cause regional development agencies to pursue transportation policies which retard development by isolating the region from all but one commercial center. A case study of resource partitioning and rural development efforts in the Ecuadorian Amazon illustrates the argument.'

Abstract: 'This study relates multiple parameters that are involved in the occurrence and control of malaria in the Amazon. Ebbs and floods, black and white waters, fishponds, and \xe2\x80\x9crepiquete\xe2\x80\x9d (Amazonian waters phenomenon) influence the density of Anopheles darlingi Root, 1926. The adaptive processes, genetic background, and resilience of Anopheles vectors change in response to climate and environmental changes. This study covers the diversity of anophelines, which increases due to anthropic activities. Regarding strategies for vector control, the following measures are important: (1) use mechanical barriers inside houses (screens and impregnated mosquito nets), (2) determine the level of anopheline resistance to insecticides, and (3) determine the effect of the physiological state of females on malaria transmission effectiveness. Bioinsecticides were found to be efficient in the control of immatures, and there was no alteration of the associated fauna. Data on genetic variability and vector populations demonstrated greater polymorphism in intradomicile subpopulations. Furthermore, knowledge on the structural genome and transcriptome of A. darlingi, associated with bio-ecology and evolution, may indicate an adaptive strategy of this species to the Amazon biome. There are anthropic activities and environmental and climatic changes that favor increased vector density, requiring specific control strategies to reduce populations of this species.'

Abstract: '\nAdding a groundwater component to land surface models affects modeled precipitation. The additional water supply from the subsurface contributes to increased water vapor in the atmosphere, resulting in modifications of atmospheric convection. This study focuses on how groundwater dynamics affect atmospheric convection in the Amazon River basin (ARB) during July, typically the driest month. Coupled groundwater\xe2\x80\x93land\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere model simulations show that groundwater storage increases evapotranspiration rates (latent heat fluxes) and lowers surface temperatures, which increases the surface pressure gradient and thus, anomalous surface divergence. Therefore, the convection over the Southern Hemispheric ARB during the dry season becomes weaker when groundwater dynamics are included in the model. Additionally, the changes in atmospheric vertical water vapor advection are associated with decreases in precipitation that results from downwelling transport anomalies. The results of this study highlight the importance of subsurface hydrological processes in the Amazon climate system, with implications for precipitation changes during the dry season, observed in most current climate models.'

Abstract: ' Biomass burning is a source of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen compounds which, along with their photochemically generated reaction products, can be transported over very long distances, even traversing oceans. Chemical analyses of rain and fogwater samples collected in the mountaineous rain forest of south Ecuador show frequent episodes of high sulfate and nitrate concentration, from which annual deposition rates are derived comparable to those found in polluted central Europe. As significant anthropogenic sources are lacking at the research site it is suspected that biomass burning upwind in the Amazon basin is the major source of the enhanced sulfate and nitrate imput. '

Abstract: 'Traditionally, the ribeirinhoeconomy has been based on strategies of multiple resource use including agriculture, fishing, and small-scale stock raising. In the last two decades though, ribeirinhostrategies of resource management have undergone major changes due to the decline of jute production (the principal cash crop), and the intensification of the commercial fisheries. As a result of these trends, there has been a shift of ribeirinholabor from agriculture to commercial fishing. Today, the diversity which once characterized ribeirinhosubsistence strategies is disappearing, and fishing has become the primary economic activity for the great majority of varzeafamilies. As pressure on varzeafisheries has increased, ribeirinhocommunities have attempted to assert control over local varzealakes and exclude fishermen from outside the community. In a number of cases, ribeirinhocommunities have closed lakes to outsiders and established informal lake reserves under local community management. These lake reserves are a promising strategy for managing lake fisheries on a sustainable basis.'

Abstract: 'This study is the first to present a quantitative survey of bird species occurring in the archipelago of Anavilhanas, located in the Rio Negro in the Brazilian Amazon and is part of the Anavilhanas Ecological Station. We asked whether bird community composition is similar among the islands, and between islands and areas dominated by the surrounding upland terra firme forest on the left (east) margin of the Rio Negro. The surveys were conducted in November and December of 1988, using two complementary methods with mist nets and boat transects. A total of 232 bird species was found for Anavilhanas including a survey done in 1998. The families Tyrannidae and Thamnophilidae showed the highest number of species (16.4% and 9.0% of the total respectively). Some species not well known or having limited distributions are relatively frequently encountered in the archipelago, such as Spizastur melanoleucus, Mitu tomentosa, Phaethornis rupurumii, Xiphorhynchus kienerii, Thamnophilus nigrocinereus, Myrmotherula klagesi, Myrmoborus lugubris, Pipra filicauda, and Cephalopterus ornatus. Hybrid Multidimensional Scaling (HMDS) ordination analysis indicated that the bird community composition is similar among islands. However, the bird community composition on the islands was significantly different from that in sites of terra firme forest at Rio Negro margins. Anavilhanas is a unique ecological system in the Amazon and has it own avifauna.'

Abstract: 'Wildlife has been traditionally used by forest communities as a source of protein, and the Peruvian Amazon is no exception. The articulation of colonist and indigenous communities to urban centers and markets results in changes in livelihood strategies and impacts on wildlife populations. To address the threat of overhunting and forest conversion, we provide a generalized characterization of colonist and indigenous communities and their hunting activities near Pucallpa, Ucayali, Peru.'

Abstract: 'This study tests four hypotheses related to forest clearing over time in Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s northern Amazon: (1) a larger increase in population over time on a farm (finca) leads to more deforestation; (2) rates of forest clearing surrounding four primary reference communities differ (spatial heterogeneity); (3) fincas farther from towns/communities experience lower rates of forest clearing over time; and (4) forest clearing differs by finca settlement cohort, viz., by year of establishment of the finca. In this paper, we examine the relationship between forest clearing and key variables over time, and compare three statistical models\xe2\x80\x94OLS, random effects, and spatial regression\xe2\x80\x94to test hypotheses. Descriptive analyses indicate that 7\xe2\x80\x9315% of forest area was cleared on fincas between 1990 and 1999; that more recently established fincas experienced more rapid forest clearing; and that population size and forest clearing are both related to distance from a major community. Controlling for key variables, model results indicate that an increase in population size is significantly related to more forest clearing; rates of forest clearing around the four major communities are not significantly different; distances separating fincas and communities are not significantly related to deforestation; and deforestation rates are higher among more recently established fincas. Key policy implications include the importance of reducing population growth and momentum through measures such as improving information about and provision of family planning services; increasing the low level of girls\xe2\x80\x99 education to delay and reduce fertility; and expanding credit and agricultural extension services to increase agricultural intensification.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Amazon in the past decades has been suffering severe landscape alteration, mainly due to anthropogenic activities, such as road building and land clearing for agriculture. Using a high-resolution time series of land cover maps (classified as mature forest, non-forest, secondary forest) spanning from 1984 through 2011, and four uncorrelated fragmentation metrics (edge density, clumpiness index, area-weighted mean patch size and shape index), we examined the temporal and spatial dynamics of forest fragmentation in three study areas across the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santar\xc3\xa9m and Machadinho d\xe2\x80\x99Oeste), inside and outside conservation units. Moreover, we compared the impacts on the landscape of: (1) different land uses (e.g. cattle ranching, crop production), (2) occupation processes (spontaneous vs. planned settlements) and (3) implementation of conservation units. By 2010/2011, municipalities located along the Arc of Deforestation had more than 55% of the remaining mature forest strictly confined to conservation units. Further, the planned settlement showed a higher rate of forest loss, a more persistent increase in deforested areas and a higher relative incidence of deforestation inside conservation units. Distinct agricultural activities did not lead to significantly different landscape structures; the accessibility of the municipality showed greater influence in the degree of degradation of the landscapes. Even with a high proportion of the landscapes covered by conservation units, which showed a strong inhibitory effect on forest fragmentation, we show that dynamic agriculturally driven economic activities, in municipalities with extensive road development, led to more regularly shaped, heavily fragmented landscapes, with higher densities of forest edge.'

Abstract: "The Ecuadorian Amazon, lying in the headwaters of the Napo and Aguarico River valleys, is experiencing rapid change in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) conditions and regional landscape diversity uniquely tied to the spontaneous agricultural colonization of the Oriente region of northeastern Ecuador beginning in the mid to late 1970s. Spontaneous colonization occurred on squattered lands located adjacent to oil company roads and in government development sectors composed of multiple 50\xc2\xa0ha land parcels organized into `piano key' shaped family farms or fincas. Portions of these fincas were deforested for agricultural extensification depending upon the age of the finca and several site and situation factors. Because fincas are managed at the household level as spatially discrete, temporally independent units, land conversion at the finca-level is recognized as the chief proximate cause of deforestation within the region."

Abstract: 'Recent research suggests that after decades of population decline, indigenous populations of the lowland tropics of Latin America are now experiencing rapid growth. At the same time, conservationists have pronounced indigenous lands as a key to the future of Amazon forests. As such, conservationists should have a good understanding of indigenous demography and impacts on conservation and development. Yet, there is little depth to understanding of these demographic changes and a dearth of quantitative research on the reproductive practices of indigenous populations. This study addresses these gaps through analyses of a household survey of 648 women of reproductive age from five distinct ethnic populations in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We estimate fertility, analyze reproductive intentions and contraceptive use, and determine the unmet need for reproductive health services. The analyses confirm high fertility rates and high levels of unmet need for contraception. With regard to program and policy implications, we conclude by arguing that isolation and cultural barriers present unique challenges to meet the reproductive health needs of these populations. Innovative approaches, such as those merging population\xe2\x80\x93health\xe2\x80\x93environment topics, may be most relevant for meeting these challenges.'

Abstract: 'Respiration from coarse litter (trunks and large branches >10 cm diameter) was studied in central Amazon forests. Respiration ratesvaried over almost two orders of magnitude (1.003\xe2\x80\x930.014 \xc2\xb5g Cg\xe2\x88\x921 C min\xe2\x88\x921, n = 61), and weresignificantly correlated with wood density (r2adj= 0.42), and moisture content (r2adj= 0.39). Additional samples taken from a nearby pasture indicatedthat wood moisture content was the most important factor controllingrespiration rates across sites (r2adj =0.65). Based on average coarse litter wood density and moisture content,the mean long-term carbon loss rate due to respiration was estimated tobe 0.13 yr\xe2\x88\x921 (range of 95% prediction interval(PI) = 0.11\xe2\x80\x930.15 yr\xe2\x88\x921). Comparing meanrespiration rate with mean mass loss (decomposition) rate from aprevious study, respiratory emissions to the atmosphere from coarselitter were predicted to be 76% (95% PI =65\xe2\x80\x9388%) of total carbon loss, or about 1.9 (95% PI= 1.6\xe2\x80\x932.2) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921yr\xe2\x88\x921. Optimum respiration activity corresponded toabout 2.5 g H2O g\xe2\x88\x921 dry wood, and severelyrestricted respiration to < 0.5 g H2O g\xe2\x88\x921dry wood. Respiration from coarse litter in central Amazon forests iscomparable in magnitude to decomposing fine surface litter (e.g. leaves,twigs) and is an important carbon cycling component when characterizingheterotrophic respiration budgets and net ecosystem exchange(NEE).'

Abstract: 'The Amazon basin is a global center of hydroclimatic variability and biodiversity, but there are only eight instrumental rainfall stations with continuous records longer than 80\xc2\xa0years in the entire basin, an area nearly the size of the coterminous US. The first long moisture-sensitive tree-ring chronology has been developed in the eastern equatorial Amazon of Brazil based on dendrochronological analysis of Cedrela cross sections cut during sustainable logging operations near the Rio Paru. The Rio Paru chronology dates from 1786 to 2016 and is significantly correlated with instrumental precipitation observations from 1939 to 2016. The strength and spatial scale of the precipitation signal vary during the instrumental period, but the Rio Paru chronology has been used to develop a preliminary reconstruction of February to November rainfall totals from 1786 to 2016. The reconstruction is related to SSTs in the Atlantic and especially the tropical Pacific, similar to the stronger pattern of association computed for the instrumental rainfall data from the eastern Amazon. The tree-ring data estimate extended drought and wet episodes in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, providing a valuable, long-term perspective on the moisture changes expected to emerge over the Amazon in the coming century due to deforestation and anthropogenic climate change.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines farm and household characteristics associated with a rapid fertility decline in a forest frontier of the Ecuadorian Amazon. The Amazon basin and other rainforests in the tropics are among the last frontiers in the ongoing global fertility transition. The pace of this transition along agricultural frontiers will likely have major implications for future forest transitions, rural development, and ultimately urbanization in frontier areas. The study here is based upon data from a probability sample of 172 women who lived on the same farm in 1990 and 1999. These data are from perhaps the first region-wide longitudinal survey of fertility in an agricultural frontier. Descriptive analyses indicate that fertility has plummeted in the region, which is surprising since it had remained high and unchanging among migrant colonists up to 1990. Thus only half of the women in our sample reported having a birth during the 1990\xe2\x80\x931999 time period, and most women report in 1999 that they do not want to have any more children. Analyses, controlling for women\xe2\x80\x99s age, corroborate hypotheses about land-fertility relations. For example, women from households with a legal land title had fewer than half as many children as those from households without a title. Large cattle (pasture) holdings and hiring laborers to work on the farm (which may replace household labor) are both related to socio-economic status that is traditionally associated with lower fertility. Similarly, distance to the nearest community center is positively related to fertility. Factors negatively related to fertility include increasing temporary out-migration of adult men or women from the household, asset accumulation, and access to electricity.'

Abstract: 'The protocols of in vitro cultivation described in the literature for mushrooms are usually correlated with temperate climate habitat, but it is necessary to study protocols for species of tropical climates. In this article, we collected, isolated, and evaluated the conditions of in vitro mycelial growth of Lentinus strigosus and correlated these with the characteristics of its habitat. These results indicate, as optimal conditions of in vitro mycelial growth for L. strigosus, the use of 35\xc2\xb0C for incubation, initial pH from 5 to 7, without illumination, Sabouraud dextrose agar medium, and agitation for culture in liquid medium.'

Abstract: 'Roots are responsible for the uptake of water and nutrients by plants and have the plasticity to dynamically respond to different environmental conditions. However, most land surface models currently prescribe rooting profiles as a function only of vegetation type, with no consideration of the surroundings. In this study, a dynamic rooting scheme, which describes root growth as a compromise between water and nitrogen availability, was incorporated into CLM4.5 with carbon\xe2\x80\x93nitrogen (CN) interactions (CLM4.5-CN) to investigate the effects of a dynamic root distribution on eco-hydrological modeling. Two paired numerical simulations were conducted for the Tapajos National Forest km83 (BRSa3) site and the Amazon, one using CLM4.5-CN without the dynamic rooting scheme and the other including the proposed scheme. Simulations for the BRSa3 site showed that inclusion of the dynamic rooting scheme increased the amplitudes and peak values of diurnal gross primary production (GPP) and latent heat flux (LE) for the dry season, and improved the carbon (C) and water cycle modeling by reducing the RMSE of GPP by 0.4 g C m-2 d-1, net ecosystem exchange by 1.96 g C m-2 d-1, LE by 5.0 W m-2, and soil moisture by 0.03 m3 m-3, at the seasonal scale, compared with eddy flux measurements, while having little impact during the wet season. For the Amazon, regional analysis also revealed that vegetation responses (including GPP and LE) to seasonal drought and the severe drought of 2005 were better captured with the dynamic rooting scheme incorporated.'

Abstract: 'Although the effects of microenvironmental factors on distribution patterns in myxomycetes have been investigated, studies of the responses of this group of organisms to different regimes of forest disturbance are relatively few in number. In an effort to understand the implications of forest fragmentation and habitat loss on myxomycetes, the project described herein was carried out at the Los Amigos Biological Station in southeastern Peru. The structure and composition of assemblages of myxomycetes were investigated in relation to three different forest types and climatic periods in the area of study. An analysis of the most commonly recorded substrates was carried out as well. The results suggested that habitat loss, through differences in forest structure, was the factor determining most of the differences in fruiting body abundance of myxomycetes among forest types. In addition, a switch in the ecological strategy of dispersal seemed to be an important factor accounting for differences in the fruiting body abundance and structure of assemblages of myxomycetes between collecting periods. This study provides evidence indicating that for microbial assemblages to maintain the balance of functional interactions within a particular forest ecosystem, the conservation of the forests themselves should be considered.'

Abstract: 'The width of the increment zones in the xylem of Swietenia macrophylla King and Cedrela odorata L. was investigated by dendroecological methods in a primary forest near Aripuan\xc3\xa3, Mato Grosso, Brazil (10\xc2\xb009\xe2\x80\xb2S, 59\xc2\xb026\xe2\x80\xb2W). The annual period of cambial cell division and its intra-annual variation were determined by dendrometer measurements of 30 trees of each species. Tree-ring width chronologies for Swietenia and Cedrela were developed from cross-dated increment curves of 33 out of 47 Swietenia and 51 out of 64 Cedrela trees. Simple correlations were computed between the radial growth increment and monthly precipitation for the period 1890\xe2\x80\x932000. In Swietenia, cambium activity occurred throughout almost the whole year, but in Cedrela it was restricted to the rainy period from September of the previous year to June of the current year. Tree-rings were formed annually in the juvenile and adult wood of Cedrela, while in Swietenia the annual formation of tree-rings was restricted to the adult wood. Consequently the age of the Swietenia trees could be dated by the tree-rings in good approximation, while age dating of the Cedrela trees was exact. Correlation analyses revealed a significant relationship between the precipitation at the beginning and at the end of the growth season and the width of the increment zones in the adult xylem of Swietenia. In contrast, the width of the growth increment in the xylem of Cedrela was significantly correlated with the precipitation in March and May of the previous growth period.'

Abstract: 'In six dominant species of the Amazonian \xe2\x80\x98Bana\xe2\x80\x99 vegetation, leaf blade characteristics, pigment composition, and chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence parameters were measured in young and mature leaves under field conditions. Leaf \xce\xb413C was comparable in the six species, which suggested that both expanding and expanded leaves contained organic matter fixed under similar intercellular and ambient CO2 concentration (C i/C a). High leaf C/N and negative \xce\xb415N values found in this habitat were consistent with the extreme soil N-deficiency. Analysis of Chl and carotenoids showed that expanding leaves had an incomplete development of photosynthetic antenna when compared to adult leaves. Dynamic inactivation of photosystem 2 (PS2) at midday was observed at both leaf ages as Fv/Fm decreased compared to predawn values. Adult leaves reached overnight Fv/Fm ratios typical of healthy leaves. Overnight recovery of Fv/Fm in expanding leaves was incomplete. F0 remained unchanged from midday to predawn and Fv tended to increase from midday to predawn. The recovery from midday depression observed in adult leaves suggested an acclimatory down-regulation associated with photo-protection and non-damage of PS2.'

Abstract: 'Biome models of the global climate-vegetation relationships indicate that most of the Brazilian Amazon has potential for being covered by tropical forests. From current land-use processes observed in the region, however, substantial deforestation and fire activity have been verified in large portions of the region, particularly along the Arc of Deforestation. In a first attempt to evaluate the long-term potential for tropical-forest degradation due to deforestation and fires in the Brazilian Amazon, we analysed large-scale data on fire activity and climate factors that drive the distribution of tropical forests in the region. The initial analyses and results from this study lead to important details on the relations between these quantities and have important implications for building future parameterizations of the vulnerability of tropical forests in the region.'

Abstract: 'Recent recognition of teleconnections between El Ni\xc3\xb1o and climatic anomalies elsewhere on the planet identify northern lowland South America as a region experiencing drought. Extensive archeological survey along the major tributaries of the Amazon during the past 15 years has defined the temporal and spatial distributions of numerous ceramic phases and traditions. An unexpected result has been identification of discontinuities in most local sequences. Large numbers of carbon-14 dates establish their contemporaneity ca. 1500, 1000, 700, and 400 B.P. These dates correlate closely with archeological evidence on the north coast of Peru for destructive mega-Ni\xc3\xb1o events. Observations of the impact of milder recent episodes on the flora and fauna imply catastrophic deterioration in local subsistence resources during prehistoric events, forcing the repeated human dispersals reflected in the linguistic and genetic heterogeneity of surviving indigenous lowland South American populations.'

Abstract: 'Gymnotiform electric fish assemblage structure is strongly correlated to dissolved oxygen (DO) availability, which exhibits considerable heterogeneity among Amazonian aquatic systems. DO is known to influence the respiratory morphology of gymnotiform fishes, and yet species-level variation among congeners endemic to alternative DO regimes has not been examined. We describe the DO environment experienced by four congeneric species of gymnotiforms (Brachyhypopomus) and correlate this to quantitative variation in a suite of gill metrics. Whitewater floodplain lakes flanking nutrient-rich whitewater rivers are seasonally hypoxic, exhibiting oxygen concentrations close to 0\xc2\xa0mg/l from late April until September. In contrast, DO levels in blackwater floodplain lakes and in terra firme forest stream habitats remain high throughout the year. Two common species of Brachyhypopomus restricted to periodically anoxic whitewater floodplain exhibited a substantially greater gill size than two common species restricted to the perpetually well-oxygenated waters of blackwater floodplain lakes and terra firme stream systems. Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) based on gill metrics separated the species that live in seasonally anoxic whitewater floodplain species from those that live in perpetually-well oxygenated habitats. Our observations suggest a history of adaptive divergence in the gill morphology of Brachyhypopomus associated with oxygen availability.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests cover less than 10 per cent of all land area (1.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89107\xc2\xa0km2) and over half of the tropical-forest area (1.1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89107 Km2) is represented by humid tropical forests (also called tropical rainforests). The Amazon basin contains the largest rainforest on Earth, almost 5.8 million km2, and occupies about 40% of South America; more than 60% of the basin is located in Brazil and the rest in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela.'

Abstract: 'The seasonality of pan-tropical wet forests has been highlighted by recent remote sensing and eddy flux measurements that have recorded both increased and sustained dry-season gross primary productivity (GPP). These observations suggest that wet tropical forests are primarily light limited and that the mechanisms for resilience to drought and projected climate change must be considered in ecosystem model development. Here we investigate two proposed mechanisms for drought resilience of tropical forests, deep soil water access and the seasonality of phenology, using the LPJmL Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. We parameterize a new seasonal phenology module for tropical evergreen trees using remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) and incoming solar radiation data from the Terra Earth Observing System. Simulations are evaluated along a gradient of dry-season length (DSL) in South America against MODIS GPP estimates. We show that deep soil water access is critical for maintaining dry-season GPP, whereas implementing a seasonal LAI did not enhance simulated dry-season GPP. The Farquhar-Collatz photosynthesis scheme used in LPJmL optimizes leaf nitrogen allocation according to light conditions, causing maximum photosynthetic capacity in the dry season. High LAI, characteristic of tropical forests, also dampens the seasonal amplitude of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR). Given the relatively high uncertainty in tropical phenology observations and their corresponding proximate drivers, we recommend that ecosystem model development focus on belowground processes. An improved representation of soil depths and rooting distributions is necessary for modeling the dynamics of dry-season tropical forest functioning and may have important impacts for modeling tropical forest vulnerability to climate change.'

Abstract: 'Knowledge of genebank and on-farm genetic diversity, particularly in an introduced crop species, is crucial to the management and utilization of the genetic resources available. Microsatellite markers were used to determine genetic diversity in 574 accessions of cacao, Theobroma cacao L., representing eight groups covering parental populations in West Africa, genebank, and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 populations in Nigeria. From the 12 microsatellite markers used, a total of 144 alleles were detected with a mean allelic richness of 4.39\xc2\xa0alleles/locus. The largest genetic diversity was found in the Upper Amazon parent population (H  nb \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.730), followed by the 1944 Posnette\xe2\x80\x99s Introduction (H  nb \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.704), and was lowest in the Local parent population (H  nb \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.471). Gene diversity was appreciably high in the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 populations (H  nb \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.563\xe2\x80\x930.624); however, the effective number of alleles was lower than that found in the genebank\xe2\x80\x99s Posnette\xe2\x80\x99s population. Fixation index estimates indicated deficiency of heterozygotes in the Upper Amazon and the Local parent populations (F  is \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.209 and 0.160, respectively), and excess of heterozygotes in the Trinitario parent population (F  is \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x920.341). The presence of inbreeding in the Local parent populations and substructure (Wahlund effect) in the Upper Amazon were suggested for the deficiency of heterozygotes observed. Non-significant genetic differentiation observed between the genebank\xe2\x80\x99s and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 populations indicated significant impact of national breeding programs on varieties grown in farmers\xe2\x80\x99 plantations. From this study, we showed that appreciable genetic diversity was present in on-farm and field genebank collections of cacao that can be exploited for crop improvement in West Africa. Suggestions for future conservation of on-farm genetic diversity and local landraces are further discussed.'

Abstract: "Human carrying capacity for tropical agricultural populations can be estimated with a computer simulation of the agroecosystem. A stochastic model is developed for estimating carrying capacity in one of the government-directed small farmer settlement projects along Brazil's Transamazon Highway. Carrying capacity is operationally defined in terms of an empirically computed relationship between population density and probability of colonist failure with respect to various criteria. When high population density leads failure probability to exceed a maximum acceptable level, population can be considered to be above carrying capacity. Colonist failure probabilities are those that are sustainable over a long period of simulated years. High variability in crop yields appears to have a strong effect on failure probability based on comparison of deterministic and stochastic runs of the simulations. Failure probabilities are raised by variability at low population densities, but are lowered at extremely high densities where most colonists would fail in an \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d year. Effects can be tested for colonists with different backgrounds or with differing agricultural practices such as fallow times. Failure probabilities in standard runs are higher than those considered acceptable to government planners at all population densities simulated in the present study's stochastic runs (lowest density 24 persons/km2), thus lending support to the informal impression of many that the carrying capacity of most of Amazonia's uplands is low."

Abstract: 'Tropical soils are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial ecosystems. Clearing of tropical rainforest for pasture has the potential to alter N2O and NO emissions from soils by altering moisture, nitrogen supply or other factors that control N oxide production. In this review we report annual rates of N2O and NO emissions from forest and pastures of different ages in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia and examine how forest clearing alters the major controls of N oxide production. Forests had annual N2O emissions of 1.7 to 4.3\xc2\xa0kg N ha-1 y-1 and annual NO emissions of 1.4\xc2\xa0kg N ha-1 y-1. Young pastures of 1\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0years old had higher N2O emissions than the original forest (3.1\xe2\x80\x935.1\xc2\xa0kg N ha-1 y-1) but older pastures of 6\xc2\xa0years or more had lower emissions (0.1 to 0.4\xc2\xa0kg N ha-1 y-1). Both soil moisture and indices of soil N cycling were relatively poor predictors of N2O, NO and combined N2O + NO emissions. In forest, high N2O emissions occurred at soil moistures above 30 water-filled pore space, while NO emissions occurred at all measured soil moistures (18\xe2\x80\x9343). In pastures, low N availability led to low N2O and NO emissions across the entire range of soil moistures. Based on these patterns and results of field fertilization experiments, we concluded that: (1) nitrification was the source of NO from forest soils, (2) denitrification was not a major source of N2O production from forest soils or was not limited by NO- supply, (3) denitrification was a major source of N2O production from pasture soils but only when NO 3 -  was available, and (4) nitrification was not a major source of 3 NO production in pasture soils. Pulse wettings after prolonged dry periods increased N2O and NO 3 -  emissions for only short periods and not enough to appreciably affect annual emission rates. We project that Basin-wide, the effect of clearing for pasture in the future will be a small reduction in total N2O emissions if the extensive pastures of the Amazon continue to be managed in a way similar to current practices. In the future, both N2Oand NO fluxes could increase if uses of pastures change to include greater use of N fertilizers or N-fixing crops. Predicting the consequences of these changes for N oxide production will require an understanding of how the processes of nitrification and denitrification interact with soil type and regional moisture regimes to control N2O and NO production from these new anthropogenic N sources.'

Abstract: 'In our study, seventy specimens from Brazilian herbaria, as well as from NY and PDD, identified as Morganella, were analyzed. They included the paratype of M. mexicana and holotypes of M. arenicola, M. albostipitata, M. compacta, M. nuda, M. rimosa. Specimens were studied morphologically and used for DNA extraction and amplification of ITS and LSU nuclear ribosomal DNA. New sequences were obtained and compared with homologous sequences from GenBank. As a result of these analyses, a new species and six new combinations are proposed. Morphological review and discussion are provided for the species from Brazil.'

Abstract: 'The monotypic genusTrachylobium [T. verrucosum (Gaertn.) Oliv.] from East Africa and adjacent islands is returned toHymenaea verrucosa Gaertn. on the basis of reevaluation of inflorescence, flower, and fruit characters together with new evidence from seedlings, pollen, leaf venation, chromosome number, and chemistry of the resins.Hymenaea verrucosa appears more similar to an Amazonian and Cuban group of species, which may have been derived from a common African ancestral stock in the Tertiary period, than to another group of species that probably evolved from the evergreen forest species and then radiated into an expanding area of drier habitats during the later Tertiary and dry intervals of the Pleistocene. Originally the genusTrachylobium was distinguished fromHymenaea by a morphological comparison with the probably more recently evolved species. A possible explanation is presented for the disjunct amphi-Atlantic distribution ofH. verrucosa and the neotropical species ofHymenaea.'

Abstract: "Tropical forest conversion, shiftingcultivation and clearing of secondary vegetation makesignificant contributions to global emissions ofgreenhouse gases today, and have the potential forlarge additional emissions in future decades. Globally, an estimated 3.1\xc3\x97109 t of biomasscarbon of these types is exposed to burning annually,of which 1.1\xc3\x97109 t is emitted to the atmospherethrough combustion and 49\xc3\x97106 t is converted tocharcoal (including 26\xe2\x80\x9331\xc3\x97106 t C of blackcarbon). The amount of biomass exposed to burningincludes aboveground remains that failed to burn ordecompose from clearing in previous years, andtherefore exceeds the 1.9\xc3\x97109 t of abovegroundbiomass carbon cleared on average each year. Above-and belowground carbon emitted annually throughdecomposition processes totals 2.1\xc3\x97109 t C. Atotal gross emission (including decomposition ofunburned aboveground biomass and of belowgroundbiomass) of 3.41\xc3\x97109 t C year-1 resultsfrom clearing primary (nonfallow) and secondary(fallow) vegetation in the tropics. Adjustment fortrace gas emissions using IPCC Second AssessmentReport 100-year integration global warming potentialsmakes this equivalent to 3.39\xc3\x97109 t ofCO2-equivalent carbon under a low trace gasscenario and 3.83\xc3\x97109 t under a high trace gasscenario. Of these totals, 1.06\xc3\x97109 t (31%)is the result of biomass burning under the low tracegas scenario and 1.50\xc3\x97109 t (39%) under thehigh trace gas scenario. The net emissions from allclearing of natural vegetation and of secondaryforests (including both biomass and soil fluxes) is2.0\xc3\x97109 t C, equivalent to 2.0\xe2\x80\x932.4\xc3\x97109 t of CO2-equivalent carbon. Adding emissions of0.4\xc3\x97109 t C from land-use category changesother than deforestation brings the total for land-usechange (not considering uptake of intact forest,recurrent burning of savannas or fires in intactforests) to 2.4\xc3\x97109 t C, equivalent to 2.4\xe2\x80\x932.9\xc3\x97109 t of CO2-equivalent carbon. The totalnet emission of carbon from the tropical land usesconsidered here (2.4\xc3\x97109 t C year-1)calculated for the 1981\xe2\x80\x931990 period is 50% higherthan the 1.6\xc3\x97109 t C year-1 value used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The inferred (= `missing') sink in the global carbonbudget is larger than previously thought. However,about half of the additional source suggested here maybe offset by a possible sink in uptake by Amazonianforests. Both alterations indicate that continueddeforestation would produce greater impact on globalcarbon emissions. The total net emission of carboncalculated here indicates a major global warmingimpact from tropical land uses, equivalent toapproximately 29% of the total anthropogenic emissionfrom fossil fuels and land-use change."

Abstract: 'The calculation of robust estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions due to agriculture is essential to support the framing of the Brazilian climate change mitigation policy. Information on the future development of land use and land cover change (LULCC) under the combination of various driving factors operating at different spatial scale levels, e.g., local land use policy and global demands for agricultural commodities, is required. The spatially explicit land use model, LandSHIFT, was applied to calculate a set of high-resolution land use scenarios for Southern Amazonia. The time frame of the analysis was 2010\xe2\x80\x932030. Based on the generated maps, emission coefficients were applied to calculate annual N2O, CH4, and CO2 emissions from agricultural soils (croplands and pastures). The results indicate that future land use pattern and the resultant greenhouse gas emissions in Southern Amazonia will be strongly determined by global and regional demands for agricultural commodities, as well as by the level of intensification of agriculture and the implementation of conservation policies.'

Abstract: "Fifty-four % of Brazil's national territory, most of it in the Amazon, has been covered by Projeto RADAM. The original images are difficult to obtain and the examples used in this article were taken from secondary, but still adequate mosaics of the radar imagery. These illustrate the principal physical units of the Amazon, thev\xc3\xa1rzea, theterra firme, and several types of highland, as well as the principal kinds of rural settlement: native clearings, ranches and new colonies. Two illustrations are included from the extension of this imagery into northeastern Brazil, one showing the coastal mountain range and the other an oasis-like settlement in the semi-arid interior."

Abstract: 'The southeastern part of the Amazon region is one of the largest agricultural frontiers in the world, leading to extensive land-use change. This paper provides evidence for the impacts of land-use change on soil organic carbon (OC) stocks along a large scale for Ferralsols and Acrisols including subsoil.'

Abstract: "Agroforestry research is being transformed from a collection of largely descriptive studies into more scientific approaches, based on process-oriented research. The development of agroforestry as a science should be based on four key features:competition, complexity, profitability and sustainability. Managing thecompetition between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients to the farmers' benefit is the biophysical determinant of successful agroforestry systems. Simultaneous agroforestry systems are more susceptible to competition than sequential ones. A tree-crop interaction equation helps quantify competition vs. complementary effects on fertility. Alley cropping, a simultaneous agroforestry system, has limited applicability because the competition factor usually exceeds the beneficial fertility effects. TheFaidherbia albida parkland, another simultaneous system, is almost always beneficial since the reverse phenology ofF. albida minimizes competition while enhancing the fertility effect. Sequential systems such as relay intercropping and improved fallows also minimize competition but the processes responsible for crop yield increases are largely unquantified. New methodologies for reliably measuring complex below-ground interactions are being developed."

Abstract: 'Recent studies have described a new tropical lowland forest type in the Guianas, the tropical lowland cloud forest. It is characterized by an enriched epiphytic species diversity particularly for bryophytes compared to common lowland rainforest, and is facilitated by frequent early morning fog events in valley locations. While the increase in epiphytic species diversity in lowland cloud forests has been documented, uncertainties remain as to (1) how this small scale variation in water supply is shaping the functional diversity of epiphytic components in lowland forests, and (2) whether information on functional group composition of epiphytes might aid in discerning these cloud forests from the common lowland rainforest. We compare the distribution of functional groups of epiphytes across height zones in lowland cloud forest and lowland rain forest of French Guiana in terms of biomass, cover as well as the composition of bryophyte life-forms. Both forests differed in functional composition of epiphytes in the canopy, in particular in the mid and outer canopy, with the cloud forest having a higher biomass and cover of bryophytes and vascular epiphytes as well as a richer bryophyte life-form composition. Bryophyte life-forms characteristic for cloud forests such as tail, weft and pendants were almost lacking in the canopies of common rain forest whereas they were frequent in lowland cloud forests. We suggest that ground-based evaluation of bryophyte life-form composition is a straightforward approach for identifying lowland cloud forest areas for conservation, which represent biodiversity hotspots in tropical lowland forests.'

Abstract: 'The temporal and geographical diversification of Neotropical insects remains poorly understood because of the complex changes in geological and climatic conditions that occurred during the Cenozoic. To better understand extant patterns in Neotropical biodiversity, we investigated the evolutionary history of three Neotropical swallowtail Troidini genera (Papilionidae). First, DNA-based species delimitation analyses were conducted to assess species boundaries within Neotropical Troidini using an enlarged fragment of the standard barcode gene. Molecularly delineated species were then used to infer a time-calibrated species-level phylogeny based on a three-gene dataset and Bayesian dating analyses. The corresponding chronogram was used to explore their temporal and geographical diversification through distinct likelihood-based methods.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests exchange large amounts of water and energy with the atmosphere and are important in controlling regional and global climate; however, climate and evaportranspiration (E) vary significantly across multiple time scales. To better understand temporal patterns in E and climate, we measured the energy balance and meteorology of a semi-deciduous forest in the rainforest-savanna ecotone of northern Mato Grosso, Brazil, over a 7-year period and analyzed regional climate patterns over a 16-year period. Spectral analysis revealed that E and local climate exhibited consistent cycles over annual, seasonal, and weekly time scales. Annual and seasonal cycles were also apparent in the regional monthly rainfall and humidity time series, and a cycle on the order of 3\xe2\x80\x935.5\xc2\xa0years was also apparent in the regional air temperature time series, which is coincident with the average return interval of El Ni\xc3\xb1o. Annual rates of E were significantly affected by the 2002 El Ni\xc3\xb1o. Prior to this event, annual E was on average 1,011\xc2\xa0mm/year and accounted for 52\xc2\xa0% of the annual rainfall, while after, annual E was 931\xc2\xa0mm/year and accounted for 42\xc2\xa0% of the annual rainfall. Our data also suggest that E declined significantly over the 7-year study period while air temperature significantly increased, which was coincident with a long-term, regional warming and drying trend. These results suggest that drought and warming induced by El Ni\xc3\xb1o and/or climate change cause declines in E for semi-deciduous forests of the southeast Amazon Basin.'

Abstract: 'Several hypotheses have been used to explain diversification in the Neotropics. Integrating evolution with ecology extends the scope of testing the frameworks of these hypotheses. We test diversification hypotheses by integrating phylogeography and ecological niche models (ENMs) using the rodent Hylaeamys megacephalus (Azara\xe2\x80\x99s broad-headed oryzomys or large headed rice rat) of the Amazon and dry forests, as a model. We estimated divergence times, ancestral areas, diversification events, historical demography, haplotype sharing, and genetic distances based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We generated ENMs and tested for niche divergence between lineages; integrated genetic data to predict gene flow corridors; and projected paleodistributions for comparison with historical demography. We found high structuring in northern Amazonia on the left bank of the Amazon River, and less structure but secondary contact in southern Amazonia and dry forests. The Northern Amazonian lineage diverged from the other lineages through dispersal followed by vicariance due to the Amazon River about 1.35\xc2\xa0Mya, while the Southern Amazonian and Cerrado lineages diverged through dispersal about 0.78 Mya. Paleodistribution models revealed expansions of dry forest lineages consistent with the Refugia Hypothesis, but not retraction for the humid forest lineage, which were not congruent with historical demography data. Niche divergence was not supported for the Northern Amazonian lineage, whereas habitat corridors linking current lineages suggest environmental continuity to their distributions that is concordant with a riverine barrier. In contrast, niche divergence was supported between the Southern Amazonian and Cerrado lineages, indicating that isolation followed by ecological divergence likely acted on this diversification. The recent Amazon River barrier and ecological differentiation observed here will surely provide insight for future studies and hypotheses of biodiversity diversification in the Neotropics. Studies that integrate evolution and ecology promise to disentangle alternative hypotheses and shed light on the biogeography of this megadiverse region.'

Abstract: 'The production of reactive nitrogen worldwide has more than doubled in the last century because of human activities and population growth. Advances in our understanding of the nitrogen cycle and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on regional to global scales is largely hindered by the paucity of information about nitrogen inputs from human activities in fast-developing regions of the world such as the tropics. In this paper, we estimate nitrogen inputs and outputs in Brazil, which is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest tropical country. We determined that the N cycle is increasingly controlled by human activities rather than natural processes. Nitrogen inputs to Brazil from human activities practically doubled from 1995 to 2002, mostly because of nitrogen production through biological fixation in agricultural systems. This is in contrast to industrialized countries of the temperate zone, where fertilizer application and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of anthropogenic nitrogen. In Brazil, the production of soybean crops over an area of less than 20\xc2\xa0million\xc2\xa0ha, was responsible for about 3.2\xc2\xa0Tg N or close to one-third of the N inputs from anthropogenic sources in 2002. Moreover, cattle pastures account for almost 70% of the estimated 280\xc3\x97106\xc2\xa0ha of agricultural land in Brazil and potentially fix significant amounts of N when well managed, further increasing the importance of biological nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen budget. Much of these anthropogenic inputs occur in the Brazilian savannah region (Cerrado), while more urbanized regions such as the state of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo also have high rates of nitrogenous fertilizer inputs. In the Amazon, rates of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are relatively low, but continuing conversion of natural forests into cattle pasture or secondary forests potentially add a significant amount of new nitrogen to Brazil given the vast area of the region. Better measurements of biological fixation rates in Brazil are necessary for improving the nitrogen budgets, especially at a more refined spatial scale.'

Abstract: 'We investigated how temperature and nutrient availability regulate fine-root productivity in nine tropical rainforest ecosystems on two altitudinal gradients with contrasting soil phosphorus (P) availabilities on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. We measured the productivity and the nutrient contents of fine roots, and analyzed the relationships between fine-root parameters and environmental factors. The fine-root net primary productivity (NPP), total NPP, and ratio of fine-root NPP to total NPP differed greatly among the sites, ranging from 72 to 228 (g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921), 281\xe2\x80\x932240 (g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921), and 0.06\xe2\x80\x930.30, respectively. A multiple-regression analysis suggested a positive effect of P availability on total NPP, whereas fine-root NPP was positively correlated with mean annual temperature and with P and negatively correlated with N. The biomass and longevity of fine roots increased in response to the impoverishment of soil P. The carbon (C) to P ratio (C/P) of fine roots was significantly and positively correlated with the P-use efficiency of above-ground litter production, indicating that tropical rainforest trees dilute P in fine roots to maintain the C allocation ratio to these roots. We highlighted the mechanisms regulating the fine-root productivity of tropical rainforest ecosystems in relation to the magnitude of nutrient deficiency. The trees showed C-conservation mechanisms rather than C investment as responses to decreasing soil P availability, which demonstrates that the below-ground systems at these sites are strongly limited by P, similar to the above-ground systems.'

Abstract: 'The increasing demand for agricultural commodities is a major cause of tropical deforestation. However, pressure is increasing for greater sustainability of commodity value chains. This includes the demand to establish new crop plantations and pasture areas on already deforested land so that new forest clearing for agriculture is minimized. Where tree crops are planted as part of agroforestry systems on deforested land, this amounts to a form of re-agro-forestation which can generate environmental benefits in addition to crop production. Here, we discuss a case where agroforestry systems based on cocoa (Theobroma cacao) are being established on crop and pasture land in the south of Par\xc3\xa1 state, Brazilian Amazon. The adoption of cocoa by farmers and ranchers of the region is stimulated by the coincidence of (1) favorable prospects for cocoa on the national and international markets including the expectation of a global cocoa supply gap; (2) environmental policies obliging land owners to reforest excess cleared land with native trees, with agroforests based on the native cocoa tree being an economically attractive option; and (3) biophysical conditions (especially soil fertility) favorable for growing cocoa in part of the region. We show that in the state of Par\xc3\xa1 at least 1.26 million hectares of naturally high-fertility soils in deforested areas outside legally protected and indigenous lands are potentially suitable for cocoa production with low agrochemical inputs, sufficient to make a significant contribution to closing the predicted supply gap. Their actual suitability depends on their state of degradation after years of pasture use and the availability of technologies and finance to convert them into tree crop agroforests. We discuss the significant environmental benefits of pasture re-agro-forestation with cocoa-based systems, including reduced emissions of up to 135\xc2\xa0Mg of carbon per hectare compared to the historically common scenario of planting cocoa after forest clearing. We identify important research questions related to the scaling up of this practice and the maximization of its environmental benefits. We conclude that the coincidence of the afore-mentioned factors could drive a re-agro-forestation frontier in this part of the Amazon, with potential for positive outcomes in terms of commodity production while generating social and environmental benefits.'

Abstract: 'The CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford) ecosystem model has been used to estimate monthly carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems from 2000 to 2009, with global data inputs from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation cover mapping. Net primary production (NPP) flux for atmospheric carbon dioxide has varied slightly from year-to-year, but was predicted to have increased over short multi-year periods in the regions of the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere, South Asia, Central Africa, and the western Amazon since the year 2000. These CASA results for global NPP were found to be in contrast to other recently published modeling trends for terrestrial NPP with high sensitivity to regional drying patterns. Nonetheless, periodic declines in regional NPP were predicted by CASA for the southern and western Untied States, the southern Amazon, and southern and eastern Africa. NPP in tropical forest zones was examined in greater detail to discover lower annual production values than previously reported in many global models across the tropical rainforest zones, likely due to the enhanced detection of lower production ecosystems replacing primary rainforest.'

Abstract: 'Protected areas are crucial for Amazonian nature conservation. Many Amazonian reserves have been selected systematically to achieve biodiversity representativeness. We review the role natural-scientific understanding has played in reserve selection, and evaluate the theoretical potential of the existing reserves to cover a complete sample of the species diversity of the Amazonian rainforest biome. In total, 108 reserves (604,832\xc2\xa0km2) are treated as strictly protected and Amazonian; 87 of these can be seen as systematically selected to sample species diversity (75.3% of total area). Because direct knowledge on all species distributions is unavailable, surrogates have been used to select reserves: direct information on some species distributions (15 reserves, 14.8% of total area); species distribution patterns predicted on the basis of conceptual models, mainly the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, (5/10.3%); environmental units (46/27.3%); or a combination of distribution patterns and environmental units (21/22.9%). None of these surrogates are reliable: direct information on species distributions is inadequate; the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis is highly controversial; and environmental classifications do not capture all relevant ecological variation, and their relevance for species distribution patterns is undocumented. Hence, Amazonian reserves cannot be safely assumed to capture all Amazonian species. To improve the situation, transparency and an active dialogue with the scientific community should be integral to conservation planning. We suggest that the best currently available approach for sampling Amazonian species diversity in reserve selection is to simultaneously inventory indicator plant species and climatic and geological conditions, and to combine field studies with remote sensing.'

Abstract: 'Airborne measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC) were performed overthe tropical rainforest in Surinam (0\xe2\x80\x9312 km altitude,2\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xb0 N, 54\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x9358\xc2\xb0 W) using the proton transferreaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) technique, which allows online monitoringof compounds like isoprene, its oxidation products methyl vinyl ketone,methacrolein, tentatively identified hydroxy-isoprene-hydroperoxides, andseveral other organic compounds. Isoprene volume mixing ratios (VMR) variedfrom below the detection limit at the highest altitudes to about 7 nmol/molin the planetary boundary layer shortly before sunset. Correlations betweenisoprene and its product compounds were made for different times of day andaltitudes, with the isoprene-hydroperoxides showing the highest correlation.Model calculated mixing ratios of the isoprene oxidation products using adetailed hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism, as well as the intercomparisonmeasurement with air samples collected during the flights in canisters andlater analysed with a GC-FID, showed good agreement with the PTR-MSmeasurements, in particular at the higher mixing ratios.Low OH concentrations in the range of 1\xe2\x80\x933 \xc3\x97 105molecules cm-3 averaged over 24 hours were calculated due to lossof OH and HO2 in the isoprene oxidation chain, thereby stronglyenhancing the lifetime of gases in the forest boundary layer.'

Abstract: 'Vegetation fires are the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The reduction of the climatic impact of these emissions is related to the vegetation susceptibility to fire (fire risk), as well as to the understanding of possible implications of changes in atmospheric circulation on fire risk in the near-future. This study evaluates the environmental susceptibility to fire occurrence based on a Potential Fire Index (PFI). Two climate simulations from the ECHAM5/MPI-OM climate model have been used to calculate the PFI: present day (1980\xe2\x80\x932000) and an experiment for the end of the twenty-first century (2080\xe2\x80\x932100). The results indicate that the proposed PFI methodology could properly reproduce the areas with the highest fire incidence under present conditions. Moreover, it was found that under greenhouse warming conditions the PFI foresees an increase in the fire risk area, particularly for the Amazon region. We concluded, furthermore, that changes of vegetation predicted to occur in the future lead to substantial modifications in the magnitude of the PFI, and may potentially extend the length of the fire season due to induced longer drought periods as compared to current conditions.'

Abstract: 'The progression rule principle is based on the relation between centers of origin and basal forms, and the prediction that recently colonized areas are where novelties commonly occur. Using this concept as the null hypothesis, the aim of the present study was to test whether intuitive predictions of this model are confirmed in the Neotropical paper wasps, a group fairly studied through phylogenetic frameworks. The analyses consisted of a careful review of the distribution of different wasps of the subfamily Polistinae with available phylogenies and the association of this information with colonization routes. This procedure allowed the determination of a two-step colonization process in the Neotropical region based on the progression rule principle, for which the round-trip hypothesis is proposed. The first route (east to west) is seen in a small group of Polistes. This route is rare but strengthens the arising of paper wasps in the Americas in a Gondwanan scenario. The second route (west to east) is remarkably repeated in several other lineages. Thus, the northwestern Neotropics, mainly Amazon Forest, is proposed as the major center of origins for living Neotropical Polistinae and the round-trip hypothesis may explain both earlier and later colonization routes of the paper wasps analyzed.'

Abstract: 'Human-induced habitat change is the main cause of species loss and can have severe effects on plant communities and the associated herbivore fauna. In this study, we investigated the effects of habitat conversion due to mining on communities of galling insects in areas of tropical rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon. We sampled galling insects in the Floresta Nacional de Sarac\xc3\xa1 Taquera, Par\xc3\xa1, Brazil, where forest plateaus are used by the Minera\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o Rio do Norte Group to extract bauxite. Our results show that human-induced habitat change via mining activities increased the local species richness of galling insects. We also found that after impact there was greater species richness of galling insects closer to the forest edge than in the forest interior. Changes in plant physiology and in the diversity of natural enemies in human-modified habitats, along with the endophagous life-form, might account for the high incidence of galling in human-disturbed habitats. This result highlights the importance of understanding how different insect groups respond to human activities, since such idiosyncrasies might have profound effects on the species\xe2\x80\x99 patterns of ecological interactions and in the outcomes of those interactions.'

Abstract: 'When the Amazonian rain forest is cut to create pasture, some of the original vegetal species survive clearing, even expressing their ability to invade agro-systems. It is true of the babassu palm, which can be considered, paradoxically, a natural resource by the \xe2\x80\x9cInterstate Movement of Babassu Fruit Breaker Women\xe2\x80\x9d or as native weed by land owners-farmers. To manage potential conflict of land uses, we study here the current density of this palm tree in different habitats, based on a combination of field data and remote sensing data. Firstly, we checked that the field survey methodology (i.e., counting free-trunk palm trees over 20\xe2\x80\x89cm in circumference) provides density values compatible with those stemming from satellite images interpretation. We can see then that, a PA-Benfica Brazilian territory revealed an average density of the babassu lower in pastures (2.86\xe2\x80\x89ind/ha) than in the dense forest (4.72\xe2\x80\x89ind/ha) from which they originate and than in fallow land (4.31\xe2\x80\x89ind/ha). We analyze in detail density data repartition in three habitats and we discuss results from the literature on the density of this palm tree versus its resilience at different developmental stages after forest clearing, depending on anthropogenic\xe2\x80\x94or not\xe2\x80\x94factors, including solar radiation, fire, weeding, clear cutting, burying fruit, and competition with forage grass. All these results can be exploited for the design of future management plans for the babassu palm and we think that the linked methodology and interdisciplinary approach can be extended to others palms and trees species in similar problematic issues.'

Abstract: 'This article looks at social entrepreneurs that operate for-profit and internationally, offering that international for-profit social entrepreneurs (IFPSE) are of a unique type. Initially, this article utilizes the entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and international entrepreneurship literatures to develop a definition of the IFPSE. Next, a proposed model of the IFPSE is built utilizing the dimensions of mindset, opportunity recognition, social networks, and outcomes. Case studies of three IFPSE are then used to examine the proposed model. In the final section, findings from the case studies are used to examine the proposed model and more fully elucidate the dimensions of the IFPSE.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents an analysis of conversion of natural habitat to human use on a global scale. Human disturbance of natural systems is classified in a three-category system and ranked using a Habitat Index based on remaining undisturbed and partially disturbed land. Data is analysed by biome and biogeographic province, allowing identification of the biomes and provinces which have been the most impacted by human activity. Temperate biomes are found to be generally more disturbed than tropical biomes. Four of the top five most disturbed biomes are temperate. Certain biomes and geographic areas stand out as conservation priorities, notably the islands of Southeast Asia, Mediterranean vegetation types, Temperate Broadleaf Forests and Tropical Dry Forests. Areas for which data deficiencies exist are identified.'

Abstract: ' Licania, currently the most species-rich genus of Chrysobalanaceae, is confined to the Neotropics, and is highly polyphyletic in molecular phylogenetic analyses. These studies show that the three subgenera of Licania, as well as sections within them, are not supported as monophyletic. Here we re-delimit the genus using a molecular phylogenetic analysis as a framework. We recognise the following eight genera: core Licania, Moquilea, Leptobalanus, Hymenopus, Microdesmia, Parinariopsis, Geobalanus; and Cordillera gen. nov. is described to accommodate Licania platycalyx. New combinations, as well as a description of each genus and a key to the species are provided, in addition to a key for all the Neotropical genera of the family, including those presented here. Chrysobalanaceae now comprise sixteen Neotropical genera and the redefined Licania, with c. 100 species, is then the second largest genus in the family after Hirtella (107 species).'

Abstract: "The archives of Flora Medicinal, an ancient pharmaceutical laboratory that supported ethnomedical research in Brazil for more than 30 years, were searched for plants with antimalarial use. Forty plant species indicated to treat malaria were described by Dr. J. Monteiro da Silva (Flora Medicinal leader) and his co-workers. Eight species, Bathysa cuspidata, Cosmos sulphureus, Cecropia hololeuca, Erisma calcaratum, Gomphrena arborescens, Musa paradisiaca, Ocotea odorifera, and Pradosia lactescens, are related as antimalarial for the first time in ethnobotanical studies. Some species, including Mikania glomerata, Melampodium divaricatum, Galipea multiflora, Aspidosperma polyneuron, and Coutarea hexandra, were reported to have activity in malaria patients under clinical observation. In the information obtained, also, there were many details about the appropriate indication of each plant. For example, some plants are indicated to increase others' potency. There are also plants that are traditionally employed for specific symptoms or conditions that often accompany malaria, such as weakness, renal failure or cerebral malaria. Many plants that have been considered to lack activity against malaria due to absence of in vitro activity against Plasmodium can have other mechanisms of action. Thus researchers should observe ethnomedical information before deciding which kind of screening should be used in the search of antimalarial drugs."

Abstract: ' Astrocaryum chambira Burret is a palm that provides edible fruits and fibers for making handicrafts. This study focused on the fiber products (hammocks and bags) made by the Bora in the Peruvian Amazonia. Making chambira handicrafts consists of several different phases. Handicrafts are marketed to tourists, river traders, or shopkeepers in the city of Iquitos. Villagers travel actively to sell their products because of the remote location of the village from the market. The prices received by producers were extremely low when considering the amount of work, but the prices were low also in other steps (middleman, tourist). Still, chambira works provide an important source of income for villagers. The greater abundance ofA. chambira in secondary forest compared with the primary forest indicates that it has potential for agroforestry. Agroforestry systems can provide a sustainable way to use land in the rainforest areas in NE Peru, and in this system nontimber forest products may have an important role.'

Abstract: 'This study presents the setup, calibration, validation and scenario application of the soil and water assessment tool for two contrasting macro-catchments along the Amazon agricultural frontier in the federal states of Par\xc3\xa1 and Mato Grosso, Brazil. Calibration and validation of the model are realised for the periods of the most intensive deforestation and agricultural expansion. In order to give consideration to the rapid, however gradual nature of land use change, the model implements an annual land use update combined with a land use dependent soil parameterization of the upper most soil layer. The comparison of these results with the results of a setup with a steady land use distribution shows distinct improvements of the prediction quality. Discharge prediction improves through the application of gradual land use change in the model by 12\xc2\xa0% for a 1.8\xc2\xa0% deforestation rate per year and 1.2\xc2\xa0% for a deforestation rate of 0.7\xc2\xa0% per year. Consequently, the validated models are applied to four land use scenarios for the period 2026\xe2\x80\x932035. Scenario simulation results show effects on the water balance proportional to land use change. Further, the changes in the water balance follow clear seasonal patterns with highest hydrological effects due to land use change during the rainy season in both catchments. Overall, with continuous deforestation, peak discharge increases. Further, the conversion of native vegetation to pasture has the highest impact on the water balance. For example, monthly discharge in the rainy season increases by up to 24\xc2\xa0% for a 13\xc2\xa0% conversion of Cerrado savannah into pasture.'

Abstract: 'Microenvironmental heterogeneity is important in the ecology and diversification of the rich palm flora that inhabits neotropical rain forests. At small-0.1-102 m-scales, neotropical rain forests exhibit high heterogeneity in numerous environmental factors: canopy conditions, conspecifics, other plants, litter, soil factors, topography, and animal mutualists and pests. These aspects of microenvironmental heterogeneity affect the performance and the small-scale distribution of palms in numerous ways, often affecting different species differently. Notably, even subtle environmental variation can be of crucial ecological importance.'

Abstract: '\nThe Atlantic Forest encompasses a high level of biodiversity, endemism and degradation; hence, it is a biome of particular interest for biological conservation. We aimed to investigate the actual geographic distribution of tree species and, among the indicator species of each vegetation type, the conservation status and potential distribution of each species along a vegetation gradient of the Subtropical Atlantic Forest. We analysed the species\xe2\x80\x99 relative constancy to determine their actual distribution, obtained 21 indicator species of the different vegetation types and modelled their potential distribution using the maximum entropy algorithm. The potential distribution models were pooled to yield a single map, which was used to predict the distribution of climatic suitability for these species in South America. Our results showed that the actual geographic distribution is restricted for most species (~72\xc2\xa0%). Araucaria angustifolia and Euterpe edulis were categorized as threatened species. The sum of the indicator-species maps showed reduced climatic suitability across most of South America. The southern region of Brazil and the southeastern Brazilian highlands, as well as a few areas of seasonal forests on higher elevations of the Bolivian Chiquitan\xc3\xada and Andean Piedmont, exhibited the best climatic suitability. Elevation was the most important variable in our models. Given the concerning level of forest degradation and the presence of endangered and geographic restricted species, our results are a relevant contribution to biodiversity conservation in the Subtropical Atlantic Forest areas, highlighting their floristic and environmental uniqueness and, therefore, the urgent necessity of preserving their biological heritage.'

Abstract: 'The prehistoric archaeology of Sri Lanka is of considerable significance for investigations of the evolution, dispersal and adaptation of our species within a variety of environments beyond Africa during the Late Pleistocene. \nIn particular, the archaeological and fossil sequences of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Microlithic tradition\xe2\x80\x99, c. 38,000\xe2\x80\x933,000\xc2\xa0cal. years BP, have yielded some of the earliest Homo sapiens fossils, microlithic technologies, osseous toolkits, and evidence for symbolic ornamentation and long-distance contacts anywhere in South Asia. The further association of the Late Pleistocene portion of these records with the tropical rainforest of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s Wet Zone also makes Sri Lanka of particular interest for debates regarding the viability of tropical rainforest for early human foraging and specialization. Yet beyond mentions of its fossil evidence, the archaeology and palaeoenvironmental contexts of the \xe2\x80\x98Microlithic tradition\xe2\x80\x99 have remained little-explored in the international literature. Here we present the first critical review of this period of Sri Lankan prehistory, examining its local chronologies, the spatial and diachronic patterns of its material cultural sequence, and relating its technological and fossil record to broader international archaeological, anthropological and genetic debates.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forest conversion contributes as much as 25% of the net annual CO2 emissions and up to 10% of the N2O emissions to the atmosphere. The net effect on global warming potential (GWP) also depends on the net fluxes of greenhouse gases from land-use systems following deforestation. Efforts to mitigate these effects must take into account not only the greenhouse gas fluxes of alternative land-use systems but also the social and economic consequences that influence their widespread adoption. The global alternatives to slash-and-burn program (ASB) investigated the net greenhouse gas emissions and profitability of a range of land-use alternatives in the humid tropics. The analysis showed that many tree-based systems reduced net GWP compared to annual cropping and pasture systems. Some of these systems are also profitable in terms of returns to land and labor. The widespread adoption of these systems, however, can be limited by start-up costs, credit limitations, and number of years to positive cash flow, in addition to the higher labor requirements. Projects that offset carbon emissions through carbon sinks in land use in the tropics might be a means of overcoming these limitations. A synthesis of the findings from this program can provide guidelines for the selection and promotion of land-use practices that minimize net global warming effects of slash-and-burn.'

Abstract: 'Recent studies suggest that vegetation can drive large-scale atmospheric circulations and substantially influence the hydrologic cycle. We present observational evidence to quantify the extent of coupling between vegetation and the overlying atmosphere. Within the context of vegetation\xe2\x80\x93atmospheric interactions, we reanalyze existing climatological data from springtime leaf emergence, emissivity, dew point temperatures, and historical records of precipitation and forest coverage. We construct new rainfall transects based on a robust global climatology. Using isotopic analysis of precipitation, we find that rain in Amazonia comes primarily from large-scale weather systems coupling interior regions to the ocean and is not directly driven by local evaporation. We find that changes in vegetative cover and state influence the temperature and moisture content of the surface and atmospheric boundary layer but are not reflected in observable precipitation changes. This analysis reaffirms the view that changes in precipitation over continental reaches are a product of complex processes only partly influenced but not controlled by local water sources or vegetation.'

Abstract: 'Agricultural development is an activity with many ethical problems. Nowhere are these problems more evident than in tropical forest regions, like the Amazon. This paper examines ethical issues associated with a particularly controversial activity in the region: pastures research. The paper discusses three general critiques of Amazonian agricultural development: ecological, social equity and cultural survival. A particular pastures research project is then examined. The paper concludes that pastures research can be an ethically sound activity when carried out in a manner that is sensitive to the social, cultural, and ecological context. The paper concludes that ethical decisions regarding agricultural research are context sensitive. A better appreciation of potential ethical dilemmas can be obtained by seeking participation by a variety of social actors in designing and carrying out agricultural research.'

Abstract: 'The tropical and subtropical moist forests of South America have been seen as remarkable for their great wealth of animals and plants and as the world leader in bird diversity. However, a problem is apparently affecting bird populations in these habitats, to the extent that most of the sites that I have studied in the last few years were practically \xe2\x80\x9cornithological deserts\xe2\x80\x9d. Censuses conducted in the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador and Bolivia have revealed no more than 15 species and 18 individuals in 1\xc2\xa0day. It is evident that this is not a problem of the kind usually induced by humans at a local level, such as deforestation, hunting or pesticide use. The low diversity and activity were observed not only in disturbed habitats, but also in well-preserved national parks and reserves. If it is related to human activities, then this must be more widespread. One such possibility is global warming. For ornithological studies, this is a very severe problem that must be closely examined to see whether it is also a threat to bird survival and if it is related to climate change.'

Abstract: 'The Muyong forest, an indigenous secondary forest in Banaue, Ifugao, Philippines, plays a crucial role in the Muyong\xe2\x80\x93Payoh system, a continuum of secondary forest and rice terrace, of the Banaue rice terraces by providing water and nutrients to the rice plants in the Payoh terraces. In recent decades, the planting of introduced tree species in the Muyong forest has threatened the sustainable provision of ecosystem services such as water balance and nutrient cycling. To further understand nutrient cycling in the Muyong\xe2\x80\x93Payoh systems, this study was conducted in Poitan, Banaue, Ifugao to gather preliminary baseline data on floral diversity, leaf litterfall rate, leaf litter decomposition rate, and diversity and succession of arthropods in decomposing leaf litter in a Muyong forest. Vegetation analysis was done by identifying and describing the trees growing inside the five 10\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0m quadrat sampling plots. Monthly leaf litter fall was collected in 1\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0m litter traps, and the dry weight was determined after oven-drying at 65\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C for 48\xc2\xa0h. Leaf litter decomposition experiment was established by laying out 12 nylon mesh bags containing fresh leaf litter in each of the four sites on the forest floor and one bag was retrieved every month to determine the change in dry weight of the leaf litter. Six bulk soil samples were collected from the Muyong forest floor and analyzed for organic matter, pH, available P and exchangeable K. Fresh leaf litter samples were analyzed for total N, P and K contents. Arthropods in the collected decomposing leaf litter were extracted using Berlese funnel and later identified up to families level using arthropod taxonomic key. The diversity of plants in the Muyong forest includes thirty-eight tree species belonging to 19 families dominated by indigenous tree species. Results showed that the monthly leaf litter fall was higher during the dry months of March to May and lower during the wet months. The estimated total leaf litter fall in Muyong forest was comparable to published litter fall from tropical secondary forests. The N, P and K contents of fresh leaf litter range from 1.0 to 1.2, 0.11 and 0.40%, respectively. The first month of decomposition has the fastest rate while the decomposition rate during the next 4\xc2\xa0months ranged from 0.125 to 0.251. Complete decomposition or mass lost in the leaf litter in the Muyong forest took place within 5\xc2\xa0months. The soil arthropods identified in the decomposing leaf litter were composed of 13 orders and 28 families. Majority of the collected arthropods were insects while other species including mites, spiders, millipedes and sowbugs were also present. Detrivore and fungivore Families were found to be dominant in the decomposing leaf litter. Moreover, the composition and succession of arthropod decomposer community varied in the three sampling methods and with the changing quality of the litter material as decomposition progressed. The wide diversity and succession of leaf litter decomposers consisting of detritivores, predators, fungivore and herbivore coupled with abundant rainfall and warm temperature are the two main factors that contribute to the fast rate of leaf litter decomposition and nutrient turn over in the Muyong forest. Thus, the Muyong forest can sustain the productivity of rice planted in the adjoining downstream Payoh terraces. Hence, the conservation and management of the Muyong forest is critical in maintaining the ecological functions of the Muyong\xe2\x80\x93Payoh continuum.'

Abstract: 'This paper contributes to the development of theoretical and methodological approaches that aim to engage indigenous, technical and academic knowledge for environmental management. We present an exploratory analysis of a transdisciplinary project carried out to identify and contrast indigenous and academic perspectives on the relationship between the Africanized honey bee and stingless bee species in the Brazilian Amazon. The project was developed by practitioners and researchers of the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA, a Brazilian NGO), responding to a concern raised by a funding agency, regarding the potential impact of apiculture development by indigenous peoples, on the diversity of stingless bee species in the Xingu Park, southern Brazilian Amazon. Research and educational activities were carried out among four indigenous peoples: Kawaiwete or Kaiabi, Yudja or Juruna, K\xc4\xabs\xc3\xaadj\xc3\xaa or Suy\xc3\xa1 and Ikpeng or Txic\xc3\xa3o.'

Abstract: 'Fruit from the palm Mauritia flexuosa (aguaje) is harvested throughout the Peruvian Amazon for subsistence and commercial purposes. Recent estimates suggest that residents of Iquitos, the largest city in the region, consume approximately 148.8 metric tons of aguaje fruit per month, the vast majority of which is harvested by felling and killing adult female trees. In this study, we sought to better understand and document the importance of M. flexuosa palm swamps (aguajales) in two Maijuna indigenous communities to inform the sustainable management of this habitat and species.'

Abstract: 'Trade in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been touted as promoting forest conservation and enhancing the well-being of local residents through increased cash income, which is considered a positive outcome. However, research on cooperation has demonstrated that increased market access and income may strengthen or weaken cooperation. Because cooperation is essential for community resilience in small-scale societies, negative effects on people\xe2\x80\x99s well-being can be expected if increased NTFP trade reduces cooperation. To evaluate whether NTFP trade affected cooperation, we used household data (survey and systematic observations) to compare the frequency of cooperation in two communities of Brazilian Amazon Caboclos, one of which engaged in NTFP trade, while the other did not. Cooperation was less frequent in the community trading NTFPs, but neither household cash income nor household participation in NTFP exploitation was associated with cooperative behavior. Decreased frequency most likely derived from indirect effects of NTFP trade, such as less time to fish or socialize, or other outcomes observable only at the community level, such as income inequality, the influx of new residents and consequent population growth. Our results indicate that conservation and development projects based on NTFP trade may negatively impact social and economic well-being of local communities.'

Abstract: 'This paper applies a participatory approach in evaluating small-scale fisheries, focusing on the Arapaima gigas fishery in the Brazilian Amazon. The evaluation uses the social-ecological system (SES) framework, adopted to explain the conditions needed for sustainability and user cooperation in natural resources management, as a more suitable alternative to the \xe2\x80\x98blueprint\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98panaceas\xe2\x80\x99 approaches, based only on property rights or governmental intervention. However, managers and users often do not have the necessary information compiled and available for a specific SES while some actions need to be taken immediately. Thus, consensus and negotiation among stakeholders about SES variables may be useful to evaluate system performance and indicate actions to promote sustainability. In the case study, using a consensus-building model, we found that arapaima SES leads to sustainability and is far from being a case of \xe2\x80\x98tragedy of the commons.\xe2\x80\x99 More investments in suitable monitoring and enforcement for adaptive management are recommended. Adopting an SES framework based on stakeholders\xe2\x80\x99 prospects may be useful until complete interdisciplinary studies become available so as to seek of sustainability in the long term.'

Abstract: 'A first step in protecting groups of similarly structured organisms is to place them into discrete taxa. Molecular genetics and phylogeny allow us to rebuild the evolutionary history of these taxa. The Neotropics has roughly 34% of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s primate diversity. However, the systematics of Neotropical primates is complex and controversial. The untufted (gracile) capuchins are traditionally classified as four species: Cebus albifrons, C. capucinus, C. olivaceus, and C. kaapori. Of these, Cebus albifrons has confusing intraspecific systematics with a large number of fragmented and isolated populations throughout its geographical distribution, and up to 13 morphological subspecies. The number of taxa of this species in Ecuador, some areas of northern and eastern Colombia, and Trinidad Island is particularly debated. Primatologists have defined two taxa of C. albifrons in Ecuador: a trans-Andean population: C. a. aequatorialis (or C. aequatorialis) and a cis-Andean population: C. a. yuracus (or C. yuracus). To better understand the systematics of this species, we sequenced the mitogenomes of 136 Cebus albifrons, two Cebus olivaceus, and one Cebus kaapori. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed at least nine significantly different haplogroups of C. albifrons in Ecuador, four of which contained exemplars from both the trans-Andean Pacific Ecuador and the cis-Andean Ecuadorian Amazon. The splits of these Ecuadorian haplogroups, and the initial diversification within them, occurred during the Middle to Late Pliocene and the beginning of the Pleistocene. Individuals we analyzed from Vichada Department in eastern Colombia were genetically distinct from other groups of C. albifrons, agreeing with morphological studies which consider it a full subspecies (C. a. albifrons). Phylogenetic analyses showed two different gracile capuchin taxa on Trinidad Island: C. a. trininatis and C. o. brunneus. We conclude that a large portion of the gracile capuchin taxa form a unique species with a complex of populations and subspecies. The species has conserved its reproductive integrity by repeated episodes of reticulation and high levels of gene flow.'

Abstract: 'A thorough review concerning palm uses in tropical rainforests of north-western South America was carried out to understand patterns of palm use throughout ecoregions (Amazonia, Andes, Choc\xc3\xb3), countries (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia), and among the different human groups (indigenous, mestizos, afroamericans, colonos) that occur there. A total of 194 useful palm species, 2,395 different uses and 6,141 use-reports were recorded from 255 references. The Amazon had the highest palm use, whereas fewer, but similar uses were recorded for the Andes and Choc\xc3\xb3. Ecuador was the most intensively studied country. Most palms were used for human food, utensils and tools, construction, and cultural purposes. Indigenous people knew more palm uses than mestizos, afroamericans and colonos. The use of palms was not random and the main uses were the same throughout the studied ecoregions and countries. Palms satisfy basic subsistence needs and have great importance in traditional cultures of rural indigenous and peasant populations in our study area. Arecaceae is probably the most important plant family in the Neotropics, in relation to use diversity and abundance.'

Abstract: 'A land-surface model (MOSES) was tested against observed fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide for two primary forest sites near Manaus, Brazil. Flux data from one site (called C14) were used to calibrate the model, and data from the other site (called K34) were used to validate the calibrated model. Long-term fluxes of water vapour at C14 and K34 simulated by the uncalibrated model were good, whereas modelled net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was poor. The uncalibrated model persistently underpredicted canopy conductance (g  c ) from mid-morning to mid-afternoon due to saturation of the response to solar radiation at low light levels. This in turn caused a poor simulation of the diurnal cycles of water vapour and carbon fluxes. Calibration of the stomatal conductance/photosynthesis sub-model of MOSES improved the simulated diurnal cycle of g  c  and increased the diurnal maximum NEE, but at the expense of degrading long-term water vapour fluxes. Seasonality in observed canopy conductance due to soil moisture change was not captured by the model. Introducing realistic depth-dependent soil parameters decreased the amount of moisture available for transpiration at each depth and led to the model experiencing soil moisture limitation on canopy conductance during the dry season. However, this limitation had only a limited effect on the seasonality in modelled NEE.'

Abstract: 'Air temperatures and relative humidities were recorded at a height of about 2 m above ground, at ground level and under fallen leaves, rocks, or down holes in rainforest, montane forest, grassland and desert in Central and tropical South America, during August and September, 1983. The results are compared with similar results previously obtained in tropical Africa. Measurements were also made down the burrows of tarantulas in Panama; and the influence of radiation on the activities of leaf-cutting ants was noted.'

Abstract: 'Humans think and communicate in very flexible and schematic ways, and a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for the Amazon and associated information system ontologies should reflect this flexibility and the adaptive nature of human cognition in order to achieve semantic interoperability. In this paper I offer a conceptual investigation of SDI and explore the nature of cultural schemas as expressions of indigenous ontologies and the challenges of semantic interoperability across cultures. Cultural schemas are, in essence, our ontologies, but they are markedly different than classical formal ontologies. They shape our ontological commitments to what exists in the world as well as the ways in which we approach and engage the world. And while they help structure our understanding of the world in which we are embedded, they are associative and flexible. They help to focus our attention to particular details of our experiences and give them salience, yet they cannot be simply reduced to a series of extracted features. They allow us to make meaning of the contextualized, cultural experience in which we are always immersed. An SDI is a shared social-technological-informational structure that, if it is to be useful and successful for sustainability in the Amazon, must incorporate and use indigenous cultural schemas. Indigenous communities must have the ability to contribute to the collection of geospatial data and their contributions recognized as legitimate forms of knowledge. In order for the SDI to work, it must recognize the larger cultural landscape to which cultural schemas can connect to the ready-to-hand elements of salient cultural experiences.'

Abstract: "This article attempts to conceptualize the dynamics of resource allocation by colonist farmers under the unique conditions of land abundance and labor scarcity which characterize frontier environments, such as the smallholder agricultural settlement areas in the Amazon basin. In contrast, most previous theoretical literature on household agricultural decision making and land-use change in rural areas considers conditions of high population density and land scarcity, and is not, therefore, adequate for understanding critical land-use changes which may be occurring in frontier regions. This article first discusses the appropriateness and inadequacies of the analytical frameworks commonly used to explain the expansion of settler agriculture into remote forest regions and the unsustainable land-use practices observed in these areas. This review serves as the basis for characterizing resource allocation under the particular conditions of frontier environments. A conceptual advance in the analysis is its consideration of the way institutional/policy factors and farm-level characteristics can interact to produce land-use outcomes. This knowledge is essential to understand not only the social and economic factors affecting present land use and choice of technology, but also those factors influencing farmers' demand for more optimal systems of land use which are consistent with varying agro-ecological potentials, demographic situations, and their own management capacity."

Abstract: 'The purpose of this qualitative case study was to describe how the JASON project was implemented in a self-contained fourth grade classroom and to examine this project within the overall context of student--scientist partnership (SSP) models of science education reform. Additionally, this study examined and described any changes in student conceptions of the nature of science as a result of participating in JASON. The primary sources of data were verbatim transcripts derived from semistructured student and teacher interviews along with notes acquired through participant observation. Overall, results indicate that the project had a notable impact on short-term attainment of science content for participants, however little change was seen in their conceptions of the nature of science. Technology was underutilized across all areas of the program and there was essentially no communication between students and scientists. These findings are related to the instructional decisions of the classroom teacher which were directly influenced by the professional development workshop available for this program. Although this project has great promise to serve as an excellent model for bringing students and scientists together to facilitate an understanding of the nature of science, that potential was not realized.'

Abstract: 'This paper develops a nested land use model for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The model is capable of systematically representing broad land covers and allocating agricultural area to the country relevant crops. We apply the model to assess the potential environmental impacts of road development in the country. Results indicate that an ongoing plan for road network expansion in the country would cause a reduction of more than 2\xc2\xa0% in the existing forest resources, an increase of about 16\xc2\xa0% in the current agricultural land, and a total loss of carbon stock estimated to be 316 TgC. The DRC government should consider forest protection a priority as road development is promoted. A plan for agricultural intensification could be safely pursued if coupled with necessary resources to prevent deforestation.'

Abstract: 'This article describes the design of a new model-based assessment framework to identify and analyse possible future trajectories of agricultural development and their environmental consequences within the states of Mato Grosso and Par\xc3\xa1 in Southern Amazonia, Brazil. The objective is to provide a tool for improving the information basis for scientists and policy makers regarding the effects of global change and national environmental policies on land-use change and the resulting impacts on the loss of natural vegetation, greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological processes, and soil erosion within the region. For this purpose, the framework combines the regional land-use models, LandSHIFT and alucR, the farm-level model, MPMAS, and the MONICA crop model, with a set of environmental impact models that are operating at the regional and watershed levels. As a first application of the framework, four scenarios with the time horizon 2030 were specified and analysed. Future land-use change will strongly depend on the interplay between the production of agricultural commodities, the agricultural intensification in terms of increasing crop yields and pasture biomass productivity, and the enforcement of environmental laws and policies. On the regional level, the scenarios with the highest increase in agricultural production in combination with weak law enforcement (Trend and Illegal Intensification) generated the highest losses in natural vegetation due to the expansion of agricultural area as well as the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Also, at the watershed level, these scenarios are characterised by the highest changes in river discharge and soil erosion that might lead to a further decline in soil fertility in the long term. Moreover, the analysis of the Sustainable Development scenario indicates that a shift in agricultural production patterns from livestock to crop cultivation, together with effective law enforcement, can effectively reduce land-use change and its negative effects on the environment. With the scenario analysis, we could illustrate that our assessment framework is capable to provide a large variety of valuable information to support the development of future land-use strategies in the study region.'

Abstract: 'The tropical Andes and Amazon are among the richest regions of endemism for mammals, and each has given rise to extensive in situ radiations. Various animal lineages have radiated ex situ after colonizing one of these regions from the other: Amazonian clades of dendrobatid frogs and passerine birds may have Andean ancestry, and transitions from the Amazon to Andes may be even more common. To examine biogeographic transitions between these regions, we investigated the evolutionary history of three clades of rodents in the family Echimyidae: bamboo rats (Dactylomys-Olallamys-Kannabateomys), spiny tree-rats (Mesomys-Lonchothrix), and brush-tailed rats (Isothrix). Each clade is distributed in both the Andes and Amazonia, and is more diverse in the lowlands. We used two mitochondrial (cyt- b and 12S) and three nuclear (GHR, vWF, and RAG1) markers to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships. Tree topologies and ancestral geographic ranges were then used to determine whether Andean forms were basal to or derived from lowland radiations.'

Abstract: 'The Neotropics bee fauna is very rich with 5000 recognised species, including 33 genera (391 species) of Meliponini, but it is estimated to be at least three fold greater in species richness. Deforestation, agriculture intensification and introduction/spread of exotic competing bee species are considered the main threats to most indigenous species, although other less obvious causes can affect the populations of some bee species locally. Efforts to conserve the native bee fauna include better knowledge of bee richness and diversity (standardized surveys, larger bee collections and appropriate identification of bee species) and of their population dynamics, raising of public and policy makers\xe2\x80\x99 awareness, commercial applications of bee products and services such as pollination and preservation of natural habitat.'

Abstract: 'The present study aims at evaluating and comparing precipitation over the Amazon in two sets of historical and future climate simulations based on phase 3 (CMIP3) and 5 (CMIP5) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Thirteen models have been selected in order to discuss (1) potential improvements in the simulation of present-day climate and (2) the potential reduction in the uncertainties of the model response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. While several features of present-day precipitation\xe2\x80\x94including annual cycle, spatial distribution and co variability with tropical sea surface temperature (SST)\xe2\x80\x94have been improved, strong uncertainties remain in the climate projections. A closer comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP3 highlights a weaker consensus on increased precipitation during the wet season, but a stronger consensus on a drying and lengthening of the dry season. The latter response is related to a northward shift of the boreal summer intertropical convergence zone in CMIP5, in line with a more asymmetric warming between the northern and southern hemispheres. The large uncertainties that persist in the rainfall response arise from contrasted anomalies in both moisture convergence and evapotranspiration. They might be related to the diverse response of tropical SST and ENSO (El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation) variability, as well as to spurious behaviours among the models that show the most extreme response. Model improvements of present-day climate do not necessarily translate into more reliable projections and further efforts are needed for constraining the pattern of the SST response and the soil moisture feedback in global climate scenarios.'

Abstract: 'In the Amazon, m\nalaria is highly endemic in indigenous populations, which are often considered one of the last barriers to malaria elimination due to geographic isolation. Although the improvement of housing conditions is a good strategy towards the control and prevention of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, this preventive practice has been barely undertaken in Latin America. An analysis of the architectural and urban features of indigenous Amazonian populations is essential to define and adapt these vector control measures. A total of 32 villages of 29 different ethnicities were studied and mapped by reviewing literature and visual information, and using a geographic information system. The most important architectural and urban characteristics influencing malaria were analysed according to the following categories: number of households and dimensions, supporting area, openings, materials, lifespan and location. Housing typologies found were classified within each of these variables. The results of this typological analysis included an easy-to-handle working template and revealing of features that benefit or hamper the presence of malaria vectors in Amerindians communities. Among risk factors, presence of open eaves, permeable walls, open-side constructions, large number of sleepers indoors, temporary-ephemeral houses, linear villages along stream banks, houseboats villages, poor urban drainage and villages surrounded by anthropogenic environments were highlighted. Indigenous settlements very permissive for anophelines were identified in ethnic groups, such as the Yanomami, Palikur, Paumari, Waimiri-Atroari and Waj\xc3\xa3pi. Positive features were also recognized, including opaque and closed houses, large radial villages on bare soil, highly elevated stilted houses and the fire indoors, found among the Yawalapiti, Ashaninka, and Gavi\xc3\xa3o-Parkatej\xc3\xaa tribes. However, as Amazonian indigenous settlement typologies vary greatly even among villages of the same ethnic group, it is imperative to undertake an individual study for each community. Using the working template in Amazonian settlements it is possible to obtain data that will help researchers not only understand how architectural and urban features affect transmission, but also define vector control measures easily applicable by health authorities and acceptable by these communities.'

Abstract: 'The Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil, is famous for its luxurious plant and animal life. We combine a literature review with recent work and show that species diversity is large but that most major plant and animal groups contain a large number of not wetland-specific species that depend on permanently terrestrial habitats within the Pantanal, or are restricted to dry areas during the low water period. These species occur also in the neighbouring biomes of Cerrado, Amazon Forest or Chaco. Until now, very few endemic species have been described, however, there are large populations of species in the Pantanal that are considered rare or endangered in South America. The number of trees adapted to long term flooding is low in comparison with the Amazon River floodplain. We hypothesize that the reason for the lack of local endemisms and the occurrence of a large number of species with a large ecological amplitude is the climatic instability of the region of the Pantanal, which suffered severe drought during glacial periods. The instability of the actual climate, which is characterized by multi-annual wet and dry periods, has a strong impact on distribution, community structure and population size of many plant and animal species and hinders spatial segregation of populations. The dependence of the system on the flood pulse makes the Pantanal very vulnerable to human induced changes in hydrology and the predicted changes in global climate.'

Abstract: 'A population of about 200 squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) living in a seminatural environment at the Monkey Jungle in Goulds, Florida, were studied to determine the composition of the population and the basic pattern of its social structure. The social associations of 95 tagged individuals were recorded over a period of three years to determine the basic social organization of the population. The monkeys lived in one group of male juveniles and three female-centered groups with peripheral male subgroups. In spite of the homogeneity of the environment, the groups utilized different foraging strategies which was reflected in differences in the mean weight of adult females. Although females changed subgroup affiliation, they remained within the same large group. Males, however, rarely changed subgroups, but the subgroups frequently changed their group affiliation.'

Abstract: 'It has been suggested that traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) may play a key role in forest conservation. However, empirical studies assessing to what extent TEK is associated with forest conservation compared with other variables are rare. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the spatial overlap of TEK and forest conservation has not been evaluated at fine scales. In this paper, we address both issues through a case study with Tsimane\xe2\x80\x99 Amerindians in the Bolivian Amazon. We sampled 624 households across 59 villages to estimate TEK and used remote sensing data to assess forest conservation. We ran statistical and spatial analyses to evaluate whether TEK was associated and spatially overlapped with forest conservation at the village level. We find that Tsimane\xe2\x80\x99 TEK is significantly and positively associated with forest conservation although acculturation variables bear stronger and negative associations with forest conservation. We also find a very significant spatial overlap between levels of Tsimane\xe2\x80\x99 TEK and forest conservation. We discuss the potential reasons underpinning our results, which provide insights that may be useful for informing policies in the realms of development, conservation, and climate. We posit that the protection of indigenous cultural systems is vital and urgent to create more effective policies in such realms.'

Abstract: 'Equatorial rain forests that maintain a balance between speciation and extinction are hot-spots for studies of biodiversity. Western Ghats in southern India have gained attention due to high tropical biodiversity and endemism in their southern most area. We attempted to track the affinities of the pollen flora of the endemic plants of Western Ghat area within the fossil palynoflora of late Palaeocene-early Eocene (\xe2\x88\xbc55\xe2\x80\x9350 Ma) sedimentary deposits of western and northeastern Indian region. The study shows striking similarity of extant pollen with twenty eight most common fossil pollen taxa of the early Palaeogene. Widespread occurrences of coal and lignite deposits during early Palaeogene provide evidence of existence of well diversified rain forest community and swampy vegetation in the coastal low lying areas all along the western and northeastern margins of the Indian subcontinent. Prevalence of excessive humid climate during this period has been seen as a result of equatorial positioning of Indian subcontinent, superimposed by a long term global warming phase (PETM and EECO) during the early Palaeogene. The study presents clear evidence that highly diversified equatorial rain forest vegetation once widespread in the Indian subcontinent during early Palaeogene times, are now restricted in a small area as a refugia in the southernmost part of the Western Ghat area. High precipitation and shorter periods of dry months seem to have provided suitable environment to sustain lineages of ancient tropical vegetation in this area of Western Ghats in spite of dramatic climatic changes subsequent to the post India-Asia collision and during the Quaternary and Recent times.'

Abstract: 'Some of the results from the climate component of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA), which are presented in this Special Issue are summarised. Recent advances in Amazonian climate modelling are also discussed. There is a range of papers which fall into three groups: surface fluxes and boundary layer growth; convection, clouds and rainfall; and climate modelling. The new insight given by this work is discussed and an argument is made for future research to employ a wider approach to Amazonian climate modelling.'

Abstract: 'Two new species of Camillea are described from localities on an east\xe2\x80\x93west transect through Ecuador between the latitudes 1\xc2\xb000\xe2\x80\x99N and 1\xc2\xb000\xe2\x80\x99S. Camillea ovalispora was collected in San Vicente de Huaticocha, an area characterized as humid lowland rainforest and premontane cloud forest; C. unistoma was collected at Cuyabeno, a protected area with black water inundated forest and primary rainforest on terra firme. Further, C. heterostoma var. macrospora is elevated to full species status as C. macrospora. New country records of six Camillea species are annotated from the same east-west transect. These are C. flosculosa, C. fossulata, C. hainesii, C. macrospora, C. scriblita, and C. tinctor. Also, previously recorded species have been annotated with new specimens added. Additionally, six distinct taxa from the transect that appear to be undescribed were included in the analysis; one is partly described but not the others due to insufficient material. The data showed an obvious altitude influence on the distribution and frequency of Camillea species. The diversity of species is lower on the western part of the transect compared to the eastern side, probably due to multiple factors such as differences in search intensity between the two slopes, difference in annual rainfall, and possibly the availability of host plants. Camillea taxa were only found at altitudes below 2,000\xc2\xa0m, with the highest diversity below 600\xc2\xa0m. Palmae is reported as a new host for Camillea species.'

Abstract: 'The optimal use of Amazonian flood-recession soils in contexts of dense settlement is, according to many anthropologists, agronomists, and ecologists, the cultivation of proteinaceous cereals and legumes. Storable protein is thought to be necessary for nutritional security through the fish-poor season. Campo Alegre, a Tikuna floodplain community of over 1300 people, is one of the largest indigenous Amazonian communities in the contemporary ethnographic record. Furthermore, some two-thirds of its agricultural production is directed toward market sale. However, in the summers of 1994 and 1995, residents cultivated no proteinaceous crops on their extensive floodplain to store for later consumption. Their utilization of these soils, a relatively new resource for them, is best understood in relation to the intensification of two traditional resource bases\xe2\x80\x94fisheries and upland soils, the resulting pressures on their production flows, and the desire to maintain them.'

Abstract: 'The sources of spatial and temporal variation and rates of nutrient deposition via throughfall were studied for 9 months in the Anavilhanas archipelago of the Negro River, Brazil. A total of 30 events was sampled individually for rain and throughfall chemistry in a 1-ha plot of flooded forest. Throughfall samples were collected in 40 collectors distributed in five parallel transects in the study plot, while rain was collected in 4 collectors in an adjacent channel. Volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations of solutes in rain were consistently lower than in throughfall, except for H+, NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  and NH 4 + . Ratios of VWM concentrations of rain to throughfall indicated that K+, followed by Mg2+ and PO 4 3\xe2\x88\x92 , were the most enhanced solutes as rain passed through the forest canopy. The deposition of solutes varied significantly among transects, except for Na+ and Ca2+, and was significantly correlated with maximum flooding depth, foliar nutrient content, soil fertility and canopy closure for most solutes. The concentrations of PO 4 3\xe2\x88\x92  and most major ions were higher in throughfall compared to those in rain due to canopy exchange and dry deposition. In contrast, NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 , NH 4 +  and H+ were retained due to immobilization by leafy canopy and ion exchange processes. Solute inputs via throughfall (not including stemflow) to a floodplain lake (Lake Prato) of the archipelago accounted for 30 to 64% of the total for most solutes in the lake at high water, which indicates that throughfall is an important source of nutrients to the aquatic ecosystem of the Anavilhanas archipelago.'

Abstract: 'An annotated checklist of species of Euphorbiaceae of the Guianas (Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana) and the adjacent region is presented and a key to the genera is provided. A total of 47 indigenous genera and 153 species are known from the Guianas, where species endemism is 14%, with the greatest number of endemics occurring in Guyana and the fewest in French Guiana. An additional 86 species and an additional seven genera are known from neighboring areas of the Guayana Region; many of these may be expected to occur in the Guianas. Taxa known only in cultivation in the Guianas include 22 species and an additional six genera. The following new combination is proposed,Croton vergarenae.'

Abstract: 'Ecuador is well known for its biodiversity and its ancient richness. This review provides an overview of Ecuadorian plant species in terms of the ethnobotany and chemistry of natural products in relation to anticancer activity. Plant species were classified into two groups: (a) Ethnomedical species with confirmed antitumor activity and (b) species indigenous to Ecuador with anticancer potential. This review shows that there is a great chemical diversity in Ecuadorian plants that can be used for potential antitumor therapeutics, and chemical and biological analysis confirms the biomedical use of the plant-derived compounds as cytotoxic agents for cancer cells.'

Abstract: 'Tropical rainforest trees adjust leaf traits during ontogeny to cope with changes in the physical environment and maximize their carbon uptake. The aim of this study was to determine the plasticity index (PI) of leaf traits in understory and canopy leaves of six Amazonian tree species. In four of the six species the PI of leaf traits varied within species, and in four of the ten leaf traits assessed, the PI differed between species. The greatest PI values were found for stomatal density (Ds) and CO2-saturated photosynthesis, and the lowest ones were found for stomatal size, and leaf thickness. Despite the differences in PI values within species, the mean PI was similar in all the six species. As the saplings grow toward the canopy, the strategy to increase carbon uptake involves increasing Ds and leaf nitrogen and reducing stomatal size.'

Abstract: "The growing assumption thattransnational corporations (TNCs) will apply``best practice'' and ``international standards''in their operations in developing countries hasseldom been checked against close observationof corporate behavior. In this article, Ipresent a case study, based on field research,of one voluntary initiative to useinternational standards and best practice forenvironmental protection in the AmazonRainforest, by a US-based oil company,Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) in Ecuador. The moststriking finding is that the company refuses todisclose the precise standards that apply toits operations. This, and the refusal todisclose other important environmentalinformation, make it impossible to verifyindependently Oxy's claims of environmentalexcellence, or assess the effectiveness of theinitiative. At the same time, Oxy uses theinvocation of international standards to wrapitself in a veneer of corporate responsibility;reassure government officials and localresidents; cultivate confusion about standardsand practices that apply to the operations;deflect meaningful oversight and transparency;and arbitrarily legitimize norms that have beendefined by special interests. In short,international standards offer great promise forneeded environmental improvements; but can alsobe used to impede, rather than advance,corporate responsibility and the development ofeffective environmental law at the nationallevel. These findings suggest that for theapplication of international standards to bemeaningful, the international community needsto move beyond statements of principle anddevelop mechanisms that can be used toevaluate, verify, and monitor independentlyenvironmental claims by TNCs."

Abstract: 'The Brazilian biomes (Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Caatinga, Pantanal, and Pampa) comprise one of the highest levels of plant diversity in the world; however, non-sustainable practices, deforestation, and land use have resulted in significant losses and fragmentation of the native forests. These ecosystems are now threatened and protection of their native plants through ex situ conservation is an urgent necessity. Cryopreservation and in vitro conservation are complementary options for securing and protecting Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s native plant species because their potential economic value is critically important to develop strategies that will (1) support their sustainable utilization, (2) protect against the over-exploitation of species growing in natural habitats, and (3) conserve the genetic diversity of germplasm from species of different provenances. Biotechnological approaches will help to address future economic and environmental demands placed upon already at-risk species. Conserving seed germplasm ex situ provides an additional safeguard against the risks (e.g., loss due to disease, climate change) of field conservation. Moreover, seed banks and cryobanks permit the long-term conservation of a wider genetic base; this offsets the labor and space intensive costs of conserving in the active growing state. This paper is a compilation of the current status of strategies applied for conserving Brazilian native plant species.'

Abstract: 'Rural\xe2\x80\x93urban migration can have both positive and negative environmental consequences for tropical forests. Rural residents exert pressure on the environment through farming, fishing, and forest extraction, yet conversely, protecting rural livelihoods is often the motivation for conserving large areas of threatened forest. This research examines rural settlement within the Brazilian Amazon to shed light on the drivers of on-going rural exodus and its environmental implications. Specifically, we examine the relative importance of public service provision and natural resources in determining settlement patterns along, and rural\xe2\x80\x93urban migration from, eight rivers in road-less regions of the Brazilian Amazon. Data include biophysical, social, and economic variables that were assessed in 184 riverine settlements along rural\xe2\x80\x93urban gradients up to 740\xc2\xa0km from the nearest urban center. Settlements were smaller upstream, and lacked key services such as schools and healthcare. We found that clustering of rural populations close to urban centers reflects the high costs of living in remote areas, despite abundant natural resources which previously justified migration to headwaters. Impeded dry-season navigability and transport costs restricted the flow of goods and services to and from remote areas, and transaction costs of trade exchange were higher upstream. A lack of school access was the main motivation for rural\xe2\x80\x93urban migration and the abandonment of remote riverine settlements. A key policy implication is that while education services could provide a powerful tool to stabilize and support rural populations, delivery is challenging in remote areas and may also encourage further rural\xe2\x80\x93urban migration in the longer term. Furthermore, river-dwellers in remote areas rarely visited remote urban centers, presumably because these journeys are too costly. We examine the implications of our findings for anti-poverty subsidies and payment for ecosystem services and conclude that transport costs required to receive payment could encourage further depopulation of remote areas.'

Abstract: 'We measured the concentrations of reduced sulfur compounds in the atmospheric boundary layer over an equatorial African rain forest. Results obtained from a dirigible hot air balloon and a tethered balloon system in the early morning hours reflect a multilayered structure of the atmospheric boundary layer with gradients of COS and CS2 indicating an uptake/production of these trace gases by the soil/vegetation system. In addition, we studied emission and deposition fluxes of volatile reduced sulfur compounds from tropical tree species using cuvettes to directly measure the exchange behavior of tree twigs. These cuvettes were operated at young trees in a forest clearing near ground level as well as at a mature tree species on top of the forest canopy, employing a specially designed tree top jungle raft (\xe2\x80\x98Treetop Raft III, Dirigible version\xe2\x80\x99) placed on the canopy crown. The results show qualitative and quantitative disparities between different tree species as well as between individuals of the same species near ground level (young) and at the top of the canopy (mature). We found some correlations between photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and emission of sulfur compounds. Comparison between measurements at the ground and at the canopy top show that the studied tree species adapts its photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in response to the climatic conditions at the canopy top. This is accompanied by a quantitative change in trace gas emission. Lower CO2 fixation rates are accompanied by an increase in the emission of reduced sulfur compounds. We propose the increase of DMS emission at the canopy top to be explained by a potential demand of nitrogen in the foliage resulting in an accumulation of sulfur.'

Abstract: 'Scholars and environmentalists in the industrialized nations have repeatedly deplored the destruction of tropical forests as a byproduct of economic development. Their position is based upon scientific, economic, and ethical arguments. Proponents of economic development from the tropical nations recognize that its immediate benefits are enjoyed by their own relatively poor populations while the benefits of habitat preservation are enjoyed by the world as a whole. So far, few institutional mechanisms have been developed that can reconcile the competing perspectives. In addition to reviewing the arguments in favor of and against habitat preservation, this paper proposes some innovative institutions that can both satisfy developmental aspirations and account for the global benefits of habitat preservation.'

Abstract: 'The aim of this contribution is to bring general information on the classification and in particular on the specific identification of scorpion species dangerous to humans. Several generic groups are taken into consideration, but the Neotropical genus Tityus C. L. Koch, 1836 is used as a major example. The content of this paper is mostly addressed to non-specialists whose research embraces scorpions in several fields such as venom toxins and public health. Although efforts have been made in the last 20\xc2\xa0years to create better links between \xe2\x80\x98true scorpion experts\xe2\x80\x99 and non-specialists who use scorpions in their research, such exchanges had never led to a consensus among those different branches of biological and medical research. Consequently, many cases of species misidentification and even more serious errors concerning scorpion classification/identification are often present in the specialized literature. In conclusion, it is suggested here that the frequent cases of misidentification observed in several reports may induce mistakes in the final interpretation of results, leading only to more inefficacity in the treatment of problems caused by infamous scorpion species.'

Abstract: 'Tropical wetlands are typically productive ecosystems that can introduce large amounts of carbon into the soil. However, high temperatures and seasonal water availability can hinder the ability of wetland soils to sequester carbon efficiently. We determined the carbon sequestration rate of 12 wetland communities in four different tropical wetlands\xe2\x80\x94an isolated depressional wetland in a rainforest, and a slow flowing rainforest swamp, a riverine flow-through wetland with a marked wet and dry season, a seasonal floodplain of an inland delta\xe2\x80\x94with the intention of finding conditions that favor soil carbon accumulation in tropical wetlands. Triplicate soil cores were extracted in these communities and analyzed for total carbon content to determine the wetland soil carbon pool. We found that the humid tropic wetlands had greater carbon content (P\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa00.05) than the tropical dry ones (96.5 and 34.8\xc2\xa0g C kg\xe2\x88\x921, respectively). While the dry tropic wetlands had similar sequestration rates (63\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa010 g\xc2\xa0Cm\xe2\x88\x922 y\xe2\x88\x921 on average), the humid tropic ones differed significantly (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001), with high rates in a slow-flowing slough (306\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa077 g\xc2\xa0Cm\xe2\x88\x922 y\xe2\x88\x921) and low rates in a tropical rain forest depressional wetland (84\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa023 g\xc2\xa0Cm\xe2\x88\x922 y\xe2\x88\x921). The carbon accumulating in all of these wetlands was mostly organic (92\xe2\x80\x93100%). These results suggest the importance of differentiating between types of wetland communities and their hydrology when estimating overall rates at which tropical wetlands sequester carbon, and the need to include tropical wetland carbon sequestration in global carbon budgets.'

Abstract: 'The impact of environmental variation on phenotypic diversification is one major issue in evolutionary studies. Environmental variation is thought to be a primary factor in evolution, especially at high latitudes. In contrast, tropical areas are traditionally viewed as the cradle where the long-term effects of biological interactions on phenotypic change reside. We analyse patterns of skull shape variation in two New World monkey groups: capuchins and howlers. These two monophyletic clades are exceptionally similar in terms of the geographic distribution of their species. Yet, their body size and diet are different: howler monkeys are large and almost exclusively folivorous, whereas capuchins are small omnivorous. We found that the size, and direction of vectors of phenotypic changes across South American biomes in those clades are not statistically different. This similarity persists after removing the strong impact of allometry in our data. Additionally, partial least squares and comparative analyses confirm that \xe2\x80\x9callometry free\xe2\x80\x9d skull shape is influenced to the same set of environmental variables in both clades. This study remarks the paramount importance of both body size and environmental variation on phenotypic evolution.'

Abstract: 'A biogeochemical characterization of the Madeira river basin has been made to evaluate the local and global effects of possible alterations in the ecosystem caused by recent intensive occupation in Rondonia state. During the period April 1983\xe2\x80\x94January 1986, sampling was made both by land and river along the tributaries and main channel of the Madeira river. The parameters analysed lead to a detailed study of the physicochemical quality of the waters of the basin and their relationship with the local geology, associated with the transport of solid material and the hydrological behavior of the ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Analysis of the fifteen years of European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis suggests that the transition from dry to wet season in Southern Amazonia is initially driven by increases of surface latent heat flux. These fluxes rapidly reduce Convective Inhibition Energy (CINE) and increase Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), consequently providing favourable conditions for increased rainfall even before the large-scale circulation has changed. The increase of rainfall presumably initiates the reversal of the cross-equatorial flow, leading to large-scale net moisture convergence over Southern Amazonia. An analysis of early and late wet season onsets on an interannual scale shows that a longer dry season with lower rainfall reduces surface latent heat flux in the dry and earlier transition periods compared to that of a normal wet season onset. These conditions result in a higher CINE and a lower CAPE, causing a delay in the increase of local rainfall in the initiating phase of the transition and consequently in the wet season onset. Conversely, a wetter dry season leads to a higher surface latent heat flux and weaker CINE, providing a necessary condition for an earlier increase of local rainfall and an earlier wet season onset. Our results imply that if land use change in Amazonia reduces rainfall during dry and transition seasons, it could significantly delay the wet season onset and prolong the dry season.'

Abstract: ' Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease in humans, has a vast reservoir of mammalian hosts in the Americas, and is classified into six genetic lineages, TcI-TcVI, with a possible seventh, TcBat. Elucidating enzootic cycles of the different lineages is important for understanding the ecology of this parasite, the emergence of new outbreaks of Chagas disease and for guiding control strategies. Direct lineage identification by genotyping is hampered by limitations of parasite isolation and culture. An indirect method is to identify lineage-specific serological reactions in infected individuals; here we describe its application with sylvatic Brazilian primates.'

Abstract: 'Soil microorganisms are sensitive to environment disturbances, and such alterations have consequences on microbial diversity and functions. Our hypothesis is that alpha diversity of microbial communities and functional diversity decrease from undisturbed to disturbed soils, with consequences for functional redundancy in the soil ecosystem. To test this hypothesis, we used soil DNA shotgun metagenomics approach to assess the soil microbiome in a chronosequence of land-use from a native tropical forest, followed by deforestation and cultivation of soybean croplands and pasture in different seasons. Agriculture and pasture soils were among the most diverse and presented higher functional redundancy, which is important to maintain the ecosystem functioning after the forest conversion. On the other hand, the ecosystem equilibrium in forest is maintained based on a lower alpha diversity but higher abundance of microorganisms. Our results indicate that land-use change alters the structure and composition of microbial communities; however, ecosystem functionality is overcome by different strategies based on the abundance and diversity of the communities.'

Abstract: 'This study evaluates the effects of oil palm plantations on environmental heterogeneity and diversity (\xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2) of aquatic Heteroptera (semi-aquatic and aquatic species) in Amazon streams. We assessed eight streams located in forested areas and 12 in oil palm plantations. As expected, oil palm areas had lower environmental heterogeneity, despite the presence of riparian vegetation. Heteropteran communities differed in forest and oil palm areas, however, only semi-aquatic bugs were affected by environmental variables. Streams in oil palm plantations had lower \xce\xb1-diversity and distinct community structures when compared to forest sites. Oil palm plantation did not affect the \xce\xb2-diversity of semi-aquatic bugs, however, there was increased \xce\xb2-diversity of aquatic bugs in these areas. These results reflect the impacts of environmental heterogeneity generated by plantations next to riparian vegetation, inducing local diversity loss. Effects on \xce\xb2-diversity differed among groups of Heteroptera, mainly due to the differences in the life histories of each group. Semi-aquatic bugs seem to undergo environmental filtering, while aquatic bugs can be structured by limiting similarity. Thus, the management and land conservation strategies adopted to preserve ecosystems within oil palm plantations were insufficient for the protection of aquatic heteropteran communities. In summary, such conservation policies should account for the particularities of different groups of the aquatic ecosystem; especially for aquatic fauna, which are usually overlooked in conservation policies for the Brazilian Amazon.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated the usefulness of herbarium collection databases for assessing patterns of species diversity and distribution based on a dataset from the flowering plant families Moraceae and Myristicaceae from the Peruvian Amazon. For Moraceae, a total of 3523 collections were used representing 134 species. The Myristicaceae were represented by 2113 collections of 46 species. We evaluated the distribution of collections based on 252 grid cells (0.5\xc2\xb0 size) covering all lowland rainforest in the Peruvian Amazon. We found that collections were concentrated in a few cells and that species diversity clearly increases in relation to collection density. Moraceae were collected in only 45% and Myristicaceae in only 31% of the 252 grid cells. Fifty percent of the collections came from just six and three cells, respectively. Most species were represented by only a small number of collections and collected only in a few grid cells, meaning a few widespread common species tend to dominate the collection records. Not surprisingly, most collections were made close to towns and transport routes. We evaluated the usefulness of rarefaction curves and diversity estimators for comparing diversity between regions. These techniques seem to be of little use for botanical collections due to violations of underlying assumptions. Problems such as accuracy of geographic and taxonomic data and strong bias in the spatial representation of the whole dataset are important to consider when basing conservation analysis, planning, and decision-making on seemingly large databases of biodiversity collections and are discussed in detail.'

Abstract: 'In this paper, we review some critical issues regarding carbon cycling in Amazonia, as revealed by several studies conducted in the Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). We evaluate both the contribution of this magnificent biome for the global net primary productivity/net ecosystem exchange (NPP/NEE) and the feedbacks of climate change on the dynamics of Amazonia. In order to place Amazonia in a global perspective and make the carbon flux obtained through the LBA project comparable with global carbon budgets, we extrapolated NPP/NEE values found by LBA studies to the entire area of the Brazilian Amazon covered by rainforest. The carbon emissions due to land use changes for the tropical regions of the world produced values from 0.96 to 2.4\xc2\xa0Pg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, while atmospheric CO2 inversion models have recently indicated that tropical lands in the Americas could be exchanging a net 0.62\xc2\xb11.15\xc2\xa0Pg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 with the atmosphere. The difference calculated from these two methods would imply a local sink of approximately 1.6\xe2\x80\x931.7\xc2\xa0Pg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, or a source of 0.85\xc2\xa0ton\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. Using our crude extrapolation of LBA values for the Amazon forests (5\xc2\xa0million\xc2\xa0km2) we estimate a range for the C flux in the region of \xe2\x88\x923.0 to 0.75\xc2\xa0Pg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The exercise here does not account for environmental variability across the region, but it is an important driver for present and future studies linking local process (i.e. nutrient availability, photosynthetic capacity, and so forth) to global and regional dynamic approaches.'

Abstract: 'This paper analyzes the history and consequences of two large scale hydroelectric projects in Amazonian Brazil. The argument makes three points. First, environmental impacts of such projects are inseparable from issues of human rights, regional economic development, and social justice.

Abstract: 'Maintenance of soil quality is a key component of agriculture sustainability and a main goal of most farmers, environmentalists and government policymakers. However, as there are no parameters or methods to evaluate soil quality directly, some attributes of relevant soil functions are taken as indicators; lately, an increase in the use of soil microbial parameters has occurred, and their viability as indicators of proper land use has been highlighted. In this study we performed a meta-analysis of the response ratios of several microbial and chemical parameters to soil disturbance by different land uses in the Brazilian biomes. The studies included native forests, pastures and perennial and annual cropping systems. The introduction of agricultural practices in all biomes covered previously with natural vegetation profoundly affected microbial biomass-C (MB-C)\xe2\x80\x95with an overall decrease of 31%. Annual crops most severely reduced microbial biomass and soil organic C, with an average decrease of 53% in the MB-C. In addition, the MB-C/TSOC (total soil organic carbon) ratio was significantly decreased with the transformation of forests to perennial plantation (25%), pastures (26%), and annual cropping (20%). However, each biome reacted differently to soil disturbance, i.e., decreases in MB-C followed the order of Cerrado>Amazon>Caatinga>Atlantic Forest. In addition, the Cerrado appeared to have the most fragile soil ecosystem because of lower MB-C/TSOC and higher qCO2. Unfortunately, the Cerrado and the Amazon, demonstrated by our study as the most fragile biomes, have been subjected to the highest agronomic pressure. The results reported here may help to infer the best land-use strategies to improve soil quality and achieve agriculture sustainability. The approach can also be very useful to monitor soil quality in other tropical and subtropical biomes.'

Abstract: 'Latin America comprehends notable variations in terms of natural environment, availability of natural resources, living standards, and demographic patterns. Latin America is a mosaic of cultures, post- and pre-Columbian. The rich variety of life forms discovered and described by chroniclers and traveling naturalists in the Neotropics contributed to the proposal, in mid-XVIIIth century, of a new system of classification and a scientific code of nomenclature for all organisms. Biodiversity was, for many centuries, a source of resources to be exploited in natura. In scientific circles, its inventory became the domain of taxonomists. But modern technology showed how important the miriad of life forms really are as sources of chemical molecules to be engineered as drugs and reassembled as novel manufactured products. We are on the brink of a new agricultural and medical revolution, thanks to the techniques of genetic engineering, which will lead eventually to the elimination of hunger and malnutrition.'

Abstract: 'A comparative analysis on the rate of fine litterfall and its associated nutrient fluxes was carried out in a mixed forest on Tierra Firme, a tall Amazon Caatinga and a Bana on podsolized sands near San Carlos de Rio Negro. There was seasonality in leaf fall and total litterfall in mixed forest and tall Amazon Caatinga forest but no definite trend in the Bana. Litterfall curves were significantly correlated among sites indicating common regulating factors in the three forests. Leaf litter from mixed forest on Tierra Firme was richer in N with extremely low Ca and Mg concentrations; tall Amazon Caatinga litter had higher P and Mg concentration, while Bana litter was low in N but K concentration was twice as high as in the other two forests. Annual fine litterfall in Tierra Firme mixed forest was nearly 4 times higher than in Bana, But N flux was 10 times higher, while Ca and Mg fluxes were similar. Tall Amazon Caatinga had Ca and Mg fluxes in litterfall 2\xe2\x80\x933 times higher than the other two forests. Within-stand efficiency of nitrogen, calcium and magnesium use, as measured by biomass/nutrient ratios, differentiates Tierra Firme from Caatinga and Bana forest: Tierra Firme has the lowest N, but the highest Ca and Mg use efficiencies. Higher P use efficiency was measured in Bana followed by Tierra Firme and Caatinga; while Tierra Firme and Caatinga showed similar higher K use efficiencies than Bana. N/P ratios indicates that Tierra Firme forest is limited by P availability, while low N availability predominates in Caatinga. Bana appears limited by both N and P. These differences probably relate to variations in degree of sclerophylly and leaf duration which determine leaf nutrient concentrations in the ecosystems studied.'

Abstract: 'Because of urgent concerns to protect tropical forests in Latin America, social science research on them has been generally \xe2\x80\x98forest-centred.\xe2\x80\x99 This forest-centred approach considers the people who inhabit the frontier as agents of land use change and forest conversion focusing on how their actions affect forest cover. Welfare indicators for forest frontier populations (income, education, health, access to basic services) are addressed only incidentally in terms of how they influence land use. \xe2\x80\x98People\xe2\x80\x99 centred research, which asks questions from the perspective of human welfare such as, \xe2\x80\x98Are frontier settlers better off than they were before?\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98What kind of socio-economic impacts does frontier life have on the people who live there?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHow can their lives be improved?,\xe2\x80\x9d has been less common. As a result, we know much about the impacts, especially adverse impacts, which settler activity on the frontier has on forest cover but little about the impacts settlement has on settlers, themselves. This paper attempts to shift discussion towards these kinds of questions and a more people centred approach by reviewing existing research that directly addresses the welfare of settlers in tropical forest frontiers in Latin America. We also review research that touches on settler welfare by considering the concept of \xe2\x80\x98sustainability\xe2\x80\x99 on the forest frontier and stakes out a comprise position between \xe2\x80\x98forest\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98people\xe2\x80\x99 centred questions or concerns. Settler welfare is defined primarily in economic terms. Household income, wealth, and agricultural productivity are interpreted a proxies for welfare in most cases. We also consider welfare in terms of access to basic services (health and education) and living conditions. We particularly consider how settler welfare indicators may change over time on the frontier. Tropical forests, defined as tropical, moist, broadleaf forests, are the main ecological setting of interest. These forests are generally the largest unoccupied areas in many Latin American countries and are thus, also the main \xe2\x80\x98agricultural frontier\xe2\x80\x99 or areas of new settlement by small farmers.'

Abstract: 'Geographic patterns of genetic variation at chloroplast markers have been successfully used to address the phylogeography and the demographic history of many plant species. Very few studies have however been conducted in important tropical centers of plant biodiversity like the African rainforests. The phylogeography of a tree species widespread in Central African mature forests, Greenwayodendron suaveolens subsp. suaveolens (Annonaceae), was investigated in the Lower Guinea phytogeographic domain (essentially Gabon and Cameroon) by sequencing an intergenic spacer of the chloroplast genome (trnC-petN1R). A total of 11 polymorphic sites, including nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), two insertions/deletions and two inversions, defined 12 haplotypes. The taxon is represented by two sympatric varieties (var. suaveolens and var. gabonica) that carried distinct and relatively divergent haplotypes. These varieties, also well distinguishable morphologically, might therefore represent true biological species. The variety suaveolens, more common and more widespread than the variety gabonica, was represented by ten haplotypes. This taxon showed a weak but statistically significant phylogeographic structure, indicating that two sets of related haplotypes essentially occurred respectively in the northern and the southern hemispheres. These results suggest that the distribution of Greenwayodendron suaveolens subsp. suaveolens, which is currently continuous in the Lower Guinea domain, might have been more fragmented in the past, possibly in relation with Pleistocene forest fragmentation.'

Abstract: 'A preliminary evaluation of the suitability of a currently operational satellite data archive, namely the NOAA global vegetation index (GVI) product, as a basis for providing information on land cover characteristics for global climate modelling has been undertaken by comparing it to several existing data bases of soil and vegetation cover. It is found that temporal composites of GVI values often continue to change beyond the accepted compositing period of three or four weeks. In extreme cases the addition of another week to the compositing period changes over 90% of the pixels. Selection of GVI class boundaries is found to be rather hard and is probably a strong function of the classification technique employed. The resulting GVI classes are generally explicable by reference to other archival material although this study identifies some specific cases of locational divergence from \xe2\x80\x98consensus\xe2\x80\x99 classification. In these locations monitoring with the GVI may prove useful. More importantly GVI values for very similar ecotypes vary widely from region to region thus rendering global classification very dangerous despite the graphic appeal of coloured maps. In its present form the NOAA global vegetation index is not a useful data source for climate modellers.'

Abstract: 'The main pioneer frontier considered by geographers is the Amazonian pioneer frontier. The occupation of the Brazilian territory has been carried out through successive economic cycles. Currently, the expansion of soybean crops in Amazonia is considered as the last economic cycle involving new migrations to still unexplored areas. Mapping this frontier is necessary in order to better understand its drivers and think about efficient land use policies to struggle its progress. In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology for mapping the agricultural frontier in the Amazonian state of Mato Grosso (Brazil) using satellite data acquired during the 2000\xe2\x80\x932006 period. We assume that the frontier evolves through successive land-use stages such as wildlands, non-croplands, extensive croplands and intensive croplands areas. The transitions between two stages can then be monitored through land-use change analysis. A particular emphasis is given on three land-use transitions named \xe2\x80\x9cdeforestation\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cintensification sub-frontiers\xe2\x80\x9d. In order to adapt this model for the use of remote sensing data, we defined (1) a relevant spatial scale corresponding to an agrarian locality, (2) relevant indices to qualify the land-use types and (3) rules applied on land-use types to define the frontier\xe2\x80\x99s location. Our results highlight the dynamic of the agricultural frontier towards northern areas. We identified four main agricultural regions with different levels of agricultural intensification. We finally discuss these results with respect to governmental policies and economics for a better understanding of the frontier\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic.'

Abstract: ' I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent 5,000\xc2\xa0m2 demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was 1.5\xe2\x80\x936 times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were 3\xe2\x80\x937 times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.'

Abstract: 'Nutrient input\xe2\x80\x93output balances are often used as indicators for the sustainability of land use systems. In a case study on plot scale in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, we measured nutrient input\xe2\x80\x93output balances of natural rainforest and two unfertilized land use systems (maize, and coffee/cacao agroforestry). These are the two major land use systems on converted rainforest sites in this part of Sulawesi. We wanted to test if (a) plant nutrient balances are negative, (b) which pathway is most important for losses of plant nutrients, and (c) if partial plant nutrient balances are suitable to evaluate sustainability of the land use systems. We measured nutrient inputs by precipitation and nutrient outputs by harvest export and leaching. We selected two locations, the first was situated on a fertile Cambisol developed on alluvial sediment soil, and the second on a less fertile Cambisol developed on weathered phyllite substrate. Nutrient losses through leaching were higher on sites with higher soil fertility. Nutrient balances in natural forest on fertile soils were negative for N, Ca, K and Mg. Inputs of P by precipitation and outputs by leaching were below detection limit. On less fertile soils, leaching of N and K in natural forest was lower than inputs by precipitation. As net nutrient losses were highest in agroforestry, followed by maize and natural forest stands, forest conversion into agricultural land will result in increased nutrient losses. Main output pathway of N, P and K was harvest, whereas main output pathway for Ca and Mg was through leaching. The annual losses of nutrients we measured were higher than in comparable studies on nutrient poor soils; however losses were only small fractions of available nutrient stocks. Our results showed negative partial nutrient balances in both agricultural systems. Nutrient balances in this study were more influenced by native soil fertility than by land use. Because we found indirect evidence that some nutrient pathways, which were not measured, may have significantly changed the overall balance (biological N fixation, weathering), we conclude that partial nutrient balances are no good indicators for sustainability of land use systems.'

Abstract: 'Many tropical regions show one distinct dry season. Often, this seasonality induces cambial dormancy of trees, particularly if these belong to deciduous species. This will often lead to the formation of annual rings. The aim of this study was to determine whether tree species in the Bolivian Amazon region form annual rings and to study the influence of the total amount and seasonal distribution of rainfall on diameter growth. Ring widths were measured on stem discs of a total of 154 trees belonging to six rain forest species. By correlating ring width and monthly rainfall data we proved the annual character of the tree rings for four of our study species. For two other species the annual character was proved by counting rings on trees of known age and by radiocarbon dating. The results of the climate\xe2\x80\x93growth analysis show a positive relationship between tree growth and rainfall in certain periods of the year, indicating that rainfall plays a major role in tree growth. Three species showed a strong relationship with rainfall at the beginning of the rainy season, while one species is most sensitive to the rainfall at the end of the previous growing season. These results clearly demonstrate that tree ring analysis can be successfully applied in the tropics and that it is a promising method for various research disciplines.'

Abstract: 'The study presents an outline of the systems analysis of the terre firme lowland forest N of Manaus, Brazil. The study deals with the water and element cycles, with litterfall and decomposition, and makes some points on the root-mat zone, the heart of the tropical forest system. Emphasis is also given to studies on the physical and chemical background of the loatosolic sediments around Manaus which mainly form the matrix of the terra firme forest in this particular area.'

Abstract: 'The Brazil nut (the seeds of the rainforest tree Bertholletia excelsa) is the only globally traded seed collected from the wild by forest-based harvesters across the Amazon basin. The large geographic scale of Brazil nut exploitation and the significant contributions to local livelihoods, national economies, and forest-based development over the last decades, merit a review of the \xe2\x80\x9cconservation-through-use\xe2\x80\x9d paradigm. We use Elinor Ostrom\xe2\x80\x99s framework for assessing sustainability in socioecological systems: (1) resource unit, (2) users, (3) governance system, and (4) resource system, to determine how different contexts and external developments generate specific conservation and development outcomes. We find that the resource unit reacts robustly to the type and level of extraction currently practiced; that resource users have built on a self-organized system that had defined boundaries and access to the resource; that linked production chains, market networks and informal financing work to supply global markets; and that local harvesters have used supporting alliances with NGOs and conservationists to formalize and secure their endogenous governance system and make it more equitable. As a result, the Brazil nut model represents a socioecological system that may not require major changes to sustain productivity. Yet since long-term Brazil nut production seems inextricably tied to a continuous forest cover, and because planted Brazil nut trees currently provide a minimal contribution to total nut production basin-wide, we call to preserve, diversify and intensify production in Brazil nut-rich forests that will inevitably become ever more integrated within human-modified landscapes over time.'

Abstract: 'Southeast Asia experiences one of the highest rates of deforestation in the tropics due to agricultural expansion, logging, habitat fragmentation and urbanization. As tropical rainforests harbour abundant recalcitrant-seeded species, it is important to understand how recalcitrant seeds respond to deforestation and fragmentation. Baccaurea ramiflora is a recalcitrant-seeded species, widely distributed in Southeast Asian tropical rainforest. In this study, B. ramiflora seeds were sown in three plots, one in a nature reserve and two in disturbed holy hill forests, to investigate seed germination and seedling establishment in the field, while laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of high temperature and water stress on germination. It was found that seed germination and seedling establishment in B. ramiflora were clearly reduced in holy hills compared to the nature reserve, although the seeds were only moderately to minimally recalcitrant. This was potentially caused by increased temperature and decreased moisture in holy hills, for laboratory experiments showed that seed germination was greatly inhibited by temperatures \xe2\x89\xa535\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C or water potentials \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x920.5\xc2\xa0MPa, and depressed by heat treatment at 40\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C when the continuous heating period lasted for 240\xc2\xa0h or daily periodic heating exceeded 10\xc2\xa0h. Unlike orthodox seeds, which can endure much higher temperatures in the air-dried state than in the imbibed state, both blotted and immersed B. ramiflora seeds lost viability within a narrow temperature range between 50 and 60\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. As recalcitrant seeds can be neither air-dried nor heated, species producing recalcitrant seeds will suffer more than those producing orthodox seeds in germination and seedling establishment from increased temperature and decreased moisture in fragmented rainforests, which results in sensitivity of recalcitrant-seeded species to rainforest fragmentation.'

Abstract: 'Underestimated rainfall over Amazonia was a common problem for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) models. We investigate whether it still exists in the CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) models and, if so, what causes these biases? Our evaluation of historical simulations shows that some models still underestimate rainfall over Amazonia. During the dry season, both convective and large-scale precipitation is underestimated in most models. GFDL-ESM2M and IPSL notably show more pentads with no rainfall. During the wet season, large-scale precipitation is still underestimated in most models. In the dry and transition seasons, models with more realistic moisture convergence and surface evapotranspiration generally have more realistic rainfall totals. In some models, overestimates of rainfall are associated with the adjacent tropical and eastern Pacific ITCZs. However, in other models, too much surface net radiation and a resultant high Bowen ratio appears to cause underestimates of rainfall. During the transition season, low pre-seasonal latent heat, high sensible flux, and a weaker influence of cold air incursions contribute to the dry bias. About half the models can capture, but overestimate, the influences of teleconnection. Based on a simple metric, HadGEM2-ES outperforms other models especially for surface conditions and atmospheric circulation. GFDL-ESM2M has the strongest dry bias presumably due to its overestimate of moisture divergence, induced by overestimated ITCZs in adjacent oceans, and reinforced by positive feedbacks between reduced cloudiness, high Bowen ratio and suppression of rainfall during the dry season, and too weak incursions of extratropical disturbances during the transition season.'

Abstract: 'This work evaluates the impact of deforestation on the climate of the eastern portion of the Amazon basin. This region is primarily an area of native tropical rainforest, but also contains several other natural ecosystems such as mangroves and savanna. It is the most densely populated area in Amazonia, and has been significantly affected by deforestation. In this study, numerical simulations were performed with a high spatial resolution, regional model that allows for consideration of mesoscale aspects such as topography, coastlines and large rivers.'

Abstract: 'Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) as well as climate are likely to affect the geographic distribution of malaria vectors and parasites in the coming decades. At present, malaria transmission is concentrated mainly in the Amazon basin where extensive agriculture, mining, and logging activities have resulted in changes to local and regional hydrology, massive loss of forest cover, and increased contact between malaria vectors and hosts.'

Abstract: 'Although ethnomedically and taxonomically guided searches for new medicinal plants can improve the percentage of plants found containing active compounds when compared to random sampling, ethnobotany has fulfilled little of its promise in the last few decades to deliver a bounty of new, laboratory-proven medicinal plants and compounds. It is quite difficult to test, isolate, and elucidate the structure and mechanism of compounds from the plethora of new medicinal plant uses described each year with limited laboratory time and resources and the high cost of clinical trials of new drug candidates.'

Abstract: 'Equatorial air temperatures at low elevations in the New World tropics are shown by pollen and other data to have been significantly lowered in long intervals of the last glaciation. These new data show that long recognized evidence for cooling at high elevations in the tropics were symptomatic of general tropical cooling and that they did not require appeal to altered lapse rates or other special mechanisms to be made to conform with conclusions that equatorial sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were scarcely changed in glacial times. The new data should be read in conjunction with recent findings that Caribbean (SSTs) were lowered in the order of 5 \xc2\xb0 C, contrary to previous interpretations. Thus these accumulating data show that low latitudes as well as high were cooled in glaciations. In part the earlier failure to find evidence of low elevation cooling in the lowland tropics resulted from the data being masked by strong signals for aridity given by old lake levels in parts of Africa and elsewhere. Global circulation models used to predict future effects of greenhouse warming must also be able to simulate the significant cooling of the large tropical land masses at glacial times with reduced greenhouse gas concentrations. Plants and animals of the Amazon forest and similar ecosystems are able to survive in wide ranges of temperatures, CO2 concentrations, and disturbance, though associations change constantly.'

Abstract: 'The objective of this study was to survey species of Ombrophilous Dense Forest (Atlantic Forest) in the Serra da Jiboia (Bahia), Brazil,  which have growth rings, to characterize their growth zones anatomically, and on the basis of these data and others already published, to provide an answer to some questions which are relevant to understanding why growth rings occur in species of the Atlantic Forest. The wood anatomy of 111 species collected in Ombrophilous Dense Forest in Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, belonging to 77 genera and 37 families, was studied to discover the presence of growth rings and if so to characterize them. Growth rings were present in most species (79\xc2\xa0%), and of these, the majority showed anatomical markers characterized by thick-walled and/or radially flattened late wood fibres, although other markers may occur together with this one. The explanation for the occurrence of this marker in the growth rings of Atlantic Forest species may lie in historical-evolutionary factors. The absence of growth rings is positively related to the species collected in the Atlantic Forest compared to those of the Cerrado. However, the presence of poorly defined growth rings was shown to be negatively related to endemic species of the Ombrophilous Dense Forest, compared to those which occur in other vegetation types within the Atlantic Forest. Contrasting conditions of water availability and seasonality in these different habitats offer a theoretical basis to explain these patterns.'

Abstract: 'In juvenile trees growing at the rainforest understory, light is the most limiting factor for growth. It has been assumed that stomata quickly respond to light irrespective of the physical conditions prevailing before leaf illumination. Nevertheless, so far this issue has not been addressed for saplings of Amazonian tree species. The aim of this study was to determine how stomatal conductance (g s) and photosynthetic parameters of Amazonian saplings respond to diurnal variation in the physical environment and to rainfall seasonality. Light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (P Nmax) and g s at light saturation (g smax) were measured in the dry (August) and rainy (January) season of 2008 in saplings of 10 Amazonian tree species (Minquartia guianensis, Myrcia paivae, Protium apiculatum, Guatteria olivacea, Unonopsis duckei, Rinorea guianensis, Dicypellium manausense, Eschweilera bracteosa, Gustavia elliptica, and Tapura amazonica). At the forest understory, variables of the physical environment were measured. Rainfall seasonality did not affect P Nmax and g smax, nor was the effect of species on P Nmax and g smax significant (p>0.05). The g s and P Nmax increased as the forest understory became brighter and warmer; as a result, P Nmax and g smax were higher at midday than early in the morning or in the afternoon. However, contrary to expectations, neither changes in air vapor pressure deficit nor air CO2 concentration at the forest understory affected stomatal opening. More investigation is needed to elucidate the role of environmental factors in modulating stomatal movements in juvenile trees growing beneath the dense canopy of tropical rainforests.'

Abstract: 'Litterfall production, decomposition and nutrient use efficiency in three different tropical forest ecosystems in SW China were studied for 10\xc2\xa0years. Annual mean litterfall production in tropical seasonal forest (TSF) (9.47\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.65\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) was similar to that in man-made tropical forest (MTF) (9.23\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.29\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) (P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.05) but both were significantly lower than that in secondary tropical forest (STF) (12.96\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.71\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). The annual variation of litterfall was greater in TSF (17.4%, P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) than in MTF (14.0%) or STF (13.2%). The annual mean decomposition rate of litterfall increased followed the order of MTF (2.72)\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89TSF (3.15)\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89STF (3.50) (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05), which was not correlated with annual precipitation or annual mean temperature, but was rather related to litter quality. The nutrient use efficiency was found to be element-dependent and to vary significantly among the three forest types (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). These results indicate that litterfall production and decomposition rates in different tropical forest systems are related to plant species composition and are influenced strongly by coexisting species and their life stage (age) but less so by the species richness. Constructing multi-species and multistory man-made tropical forest is an effective way to enhance biological productivity and maintain soil nutrients on degraded tropical land.'

Abstract: 'The ungurahua palm (Oenocarpus bataua subsp.bataua) is widely used throughout the Amazon Basin for its thatch, fibers, wood, and edible fruits. The fruits of this species are especially important to indigenous peoples and yield a high quality oil. This study examines the use of this species by the Siona people of the Ecuadorian Amazon in the Cuyabeno Faunistic Reserve. The reproductive phenology, fruit production, and relationship between vegetative characteristics and fruit production is explored here. Fruit production varies greatly from palm to palm with a range of approximately 500\xe2\x80\x937000 fruits biennially. This amounts to approximately 700 kg/ha every two years. Height, diameter breast height (dbh), and number of leaves on an individual are poor predictors of tree productivity. Reproductive histories of individual palms are examined. The economic potential of this species and the implications of overharvesting are discussed.'

Abstract: 'The dissolved humic substances of seven Venezuelan blackwater rivers, belonging to different tropical biogeographical regions, were analyzed. Fractionation using Sephadex gel together with an analysis of their fluorescence, absorbance and infrared spectral properties, showed differences between their humic substances. These differences were related to their biological sources and humification environment. Statistical analysis of the properties of these humic substances allowed us to separate the rivers into three groups. These groups were directly related to the geological features and vegetation of the terrestrial ecosystems into which they drain:'

Abstract: 'In tropical forests farmers are among the most important agents of deforestation. At the interface between societies and their environment, ecosystem services (ES) is an integrated working framework through which natural and anthropogenic dimensions can be addressed. Here, we aimed to understand to what extent farmers impact ES availability. Based on case studies in three locations in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, we performed statistical analyses at 135 sampling points and 110 farms to link socioeconomic and ES data, both derived from field work. The socioeconomic data characterized agricultural production, sociological characteristics, and quality of life. ES data were obtained from statistical analyses that yielded a multiple ES indicator for each sampling point and farm. Our results produced three main findings: first, the establishment of ES associations is due more to agricultural production characteristics than to sociological and quality-of-life factors. Second, the impact of agricultural production on ES availability depends on the level of total incomes. An increase in incomes causes a decrease in the forest cover that provides many ES and an increase in other areas that provide fewer ES. Finally, our analyses show a very strong site effect that probably expresses the heterogeneity of the biophysical contexts, but also the importance for ES availability of the historical depth of deforestation and/or the role of specific public policies. Finding ways of producing an alternative impact on ES availability and establishing specific ES associations will therefore depend more on changes in the global political context than in individual practices.'

Abstract: 'There is currently a huge gulf between natural scientists\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of climate tipping points and economists\xe2\x80\x99 representations of climate catastrophes in integrated assessment models (IAMs). In particular, there are multiple potential tipping points and they are not all low-probability events; at least one has a significant probability of being passed this century under mid-range (2\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) global warming, and they cannot all be ruled out at low (<2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) warming. In contrast, the dominant framing of climate catastrophes in IAMs, and in critiques of them, is that they are associated with high (> 4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) or very high (> 8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) global warming. This discrepancy could qualitatively alter the predictions of IAMs, including estimates of the social cost of carbon. To address this discrepancy and assess the economic impact of crossing different climate tipping points, we highlight a list of scientific points that should be considered, at least in a stylised form, in simplified IAMs. For nine different tipping events, the range of expected physical climate impacts is summarised and some suggestions are made for how they may translate into socio-economic impacts on particular sectors or regions. We also consider how passing climate tipping points could affect economic growth.'

Abstract: 'This article reviews the principal tendencies in the contemporary studies of indigenous South American religious traditions. It divides the field into studies of socioreligious formations (particularistic and universalistic formations, more specifically) and studies of cosmologies or worldviews (so-called perspectivism). It then discusses two recent, pioneering biographies of South American shamans which, more than any other in the field, offer original approaches to understanding shamanic historical consciousness, cosmopolitics, the constant struggles of shamanic spirits to sustain the cosmos against sorcery spirits that threaten to undermine the cosmic order.'

Abstract: 'We present a theoretical model, based on a simple model of turbulent diffusion and first-order chemical kinetics, to determine air-parcel residence times and the out-of-canopy export of reactive gases emitted within forest canopies under neutral conditions. Theoretical predictions of the air-parcel residence time are compared to values derived from large-eddy simulation for a range of canopy architectures and turbulence levels under neutral stratification. Median air-parcel residence times range from a few sec in the upper canopy to approximately 30\xc2\xa0min near the ground and the distribution of residence times is skewed towards longer times in the lower canopy. While the predicted probability density functions from the theoretical model and large-eddy simulation are in good agreement with each other, the theoretical model requires only information on canopy height and eddy diffusivities inside the canopy. The eddy-diffusivity model developed additionally requires the friction velocity at canopy top and a parametrized profile of the standard deviation of vertical velocity. The theoretical model of air-parcel residence times is extended to include first-order chemical reactions over a range of of Damk\xc3\xb6hler numbers (Da) characteristic of plant-emitted hydrocarbons. The resulting out-of-canopy export fractions range from near 1 for \\(Da =10^{-3}\\) to less than 0.3 at \\(Da = 10\\). These results highlight the necessity for dense and tall forests to include the impacts of air-parcel residence times when calculating the out-of-canopy export fraction for reactive trace gases.'

Abstract: "Sustainable use of the Amazon forest for timber production is conditioned by the effect of logging on the system's nutrient cycling. This paper reports the results of a soil moisture and soil water chemistry monitoring campaign before and immediately after a selective logging which removed 35 m3 wood/ha. Soil moisture was measured using tensiometers, and soil water chemistry using suction samplers in five disturbance classes: tractor tracks, clearing centres, clearing edges, forest edges and untouched forest. The results show that the soil under the tractor tracks and clearings contained more moisture than under the untouched forest. The suction samplers extracted substantially more nitrate, ammonium, calcium, magnesium and potassium from the clearing centres, the tractor tracks and the clearing edges than from the forest sites. The results are explained in terms of altered microbial activity, changes in crown interception and uptake by roots."

Abstract: ' Since 1987, Penan foragers in Malaysia have been increasingly affected by the activities of logging companies, and have protested this with blockades. Simultaneously, they have become the focus of a broad-based international environmental campaign. This paper examines the rhetoric of that campaign. In particular, I examine the ways in which Western environmentalists have constructed Penan land rights with reference to Penan knowledge of the landscape and of the biotic elements which exist there. Further, I consider how environmentalists have drawn on ethnographic accounts, and how those accounts are transformed in the process of generating images deployed in the campaign. '

Abstract: 'Araceae is one of the largest herb families in tropical America, but its patterns of diversity and endemism are poorly known. We used predictive distribution modelling in GIS to study Araceae richness on a landscape scale in Ecuador. Modelling was based on georeferenced herbarium collections with humidity and mean annual temperature as climatic variables. Variation partitioning using multiple regression showed that humidity and altitude were main factors in explaining Araceae diversity patterns. Endemism was less well explained by present climatic factors. Unlike common diversity patterns of herbs or epiphytes, Araceae richness was highest in the eastern (Amazon) lowland rain forest with a secondary centre on the Andean foothills of northwestern Ecuador. The peak in endemism was on the western slopes of the Andes, corresponding to areas that have been severely affected by human activities and deforestation. Eastern lowland (Amazonian) forests were poor in endemic Araceae.'

Abstract: 'This paper offers a technical and geopolitical reappraisal of a macro-engineering proposal to plumb Earth\xe2\x80\x99s freshwater, siphoning some of it from a region of surplus (Amazon River Basin) to a region of shortage (arid northern Africa) via his positively buoyant (subsurface floating) seabed-anchored Transatlantic Freshwater Aqueduct. Two different routes for the pipeline, of length 4,317 and 3,745\xc2\xa0km, respectively, have been considered. Pipe diameters larger than 60\xc2\xa0m are necessary for \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d low pumping power (i.e., less than 20\xc2\xa0GW). Using a bundle of smaller size pipes instead of a larger single pipe might overcome technical difficulties but the advantage of simplifying the construction technology might be exceeded by the disadvantage of consuming more power in operation. To keep the number of pumping stations reasonably small (i.e. fewer than 20) a single pipe of diameter higher than 30\xc2\xa0m (or bundles of smaller diameter pipes) is required. The Atlantic Ocean currents may be used to provide the necessary power for pumps. The available power possibly provided by the North Brazil Current ranges between 2 and 9 GW. The North Equatorial Current may provide less than 0.3 GW power while the North Equatorial Counter Current provides the largest power availability, ranging between 2 and about 100 GW. A rough cost estimate of the project is about 20,600 GUSD and 18,400 GUSD, respectively, for two pipeline routes.'

Abstract: 'The present contribution discusses the soil P status of central Amazonian upland soils, the effects of tree crops on soil P availability and the factors controlling soil P cycling in land use systems with tree crops. Soil fertility management has to target the prevalent P deficiency by adequate P fertilization, especially in southern and northern municipalities of central Amaz\xc3\xb4nia where the largest areas with severe P deficiency are found. P fixation to clay minerals is not a major obstacle for P management in the highly weathered upland soils of the central Amazon due to their low Al- and Fe-oxide contents. Low total soil P amounts are mainly responsible for low P availability. Tree crops are found to be especially suitable for land use under low-P-input conditions. Their large P return to soil by litterfall and pruning improves soil P availability. Additionally, litter quality affects P release and soil P availability. Both aspects, quantity and quality effects, are strongly dependent on tree species. Phosphorus sorption does not seem to be reduced by different litter types confirming earlier results that P fixation is not a major problem in central Amazonian upland soils. In conclusion, biological approaches are more important than physical approaches to improve soil P availability in central Amazonian Oxisols. With large P cycling through soil microbial biomass and between plant and soil, a higher availability of added P can be maintained and P applications only need to replenish P exports by harvest. Low P additions will improve productivity also for long-term uptake by trees. This is of high importance in regions with poor infrastructure and the lack of financial resources.'

Abstract: 'Malaria is still a major public health problem in Brazil, with approximately 306 000 registered cases in 2009, but it is estimated that in the early 1940s, around six million cases of malaria occurred each year. As a result of the fight against the disease, the number of malaria cases decreased over the years and the smallest numbers of cases to-date were recorded in the 1960s. From the mid-1960s onwards, Brazil underwent a rapid and disorganized settlement process in the Amazon and this migratory movement led to a progressive increase in the number of reported cases. Although the main mosquito vector (Anopheles darlingi) is present in about 80% of the country, currently the incidence of malaria in Brazil is almost exclusively (99,8% of the cases) restricted to the region of the Amazon Basin, where a number of combined factors favors disease transmission and impair the use of standard control procedures. Plasmodium vivax accounts for 83,7% of registered cases, while Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for 16,3% and Plasmodium malariae is seldom observed. Although vivax malaria is thought to cause little mortality, compared to falciparum malaria, it accounts for much of the morbidity and for huge burdens on the prosperity of endemic communities. However, in the last few years a pattern of unusual clinical complications with fatal cases associated with P. vivax have been reported in Brazil and this is a matter of concern for Brazilian malariologists. In addition, the emergence of P. vivax strains resistant to chloroquine in some reports needs to be further investigated. In contrast, asymptomatic infection by P. falciparum and P. vivax has been detected in epidemiological studies in the states of Rondonia and Amazonas, indicating probably a pattern of clinical immunity in both autochthonous and migrant populations. Seropidemiological studies investigating the type of immune responses elicited in naturally-exposed populations to several malaria vaccine candidates in Brazilian populations have also been providing important information on whether immune responses specific to these antigens are generated in natural infections and their immunogenic potential as vaccine candidates. The present difficulties in reducing economic and social risk factors that determine the incidence of malaria in the Amazon Region render impracticable its elimination in the region. As a result, a malaria-integrated control effort - as a joint action on the part of the government and the population - directed towards the elimination or reduction of the risks of death or illness, is the direction adopted by the Brazilian government in the fight against the disease.'

Abstract: ' The importance of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for forest-dwelling people in the tropics and the relatively small ecological impact of their exploitation has raised high expectations as to their potential to contribute to tropical forest conservation. Three major issues in relation to NTFPs are addressed: their potential to contribute to the conservation of tropical rainforests; their potential to improve the livelihood of forest-dwelling peoples and their potential for participatory forest management. It is concluded that for the proper management of NTFP resources, it is necessary to be specific about the aim of NTFP development and to take account of ecological as well as social and economic factors. Policymaking and land-use planning must furthermore take into account that NTFP extraction is part of an overall livelihood strategy of the people involved, in which other economic activities also play a role.'

Abstract: 'Extractive reserves, usually associated with the survival of rubber tappers in the Brazilian tropics, have close parallels elsewhere, including temperate zones. This research isolates the distinctive features of recent Amazonian reserves, illustrates parallel features in a fifty year-old management experiment in the United States, and explores the advantages extractive reserves offer land reformers interested not only in social equity and efficiency but in biological conservation. Extractive reserves stand apart from traditional land reforms in their innovative use of common property, a tenure mode well adapted to sustainable management of marginal lands.'

Abstract: 'Recent estimates of the net release of carbon to the atmosphere from deforestation in the tropics have ranged between 0.4 and 2.5 \xc3\x97 1015 g yr\xe2\x88\x921. Two things have happened to require a revision of these estimates. First, refinements of the methods used to estimate the stocks of carbon in the vegetation of tropical forests have produced new estimates that are intermediate between the previous high and low estimates of carbon stocks. When these revised estimates were used here to calculate the emissions of carbon from deforestation, the new range was 1.0\xe2\x80\x932.0 \xc3\x97 1015 g C.'

Abstract: 'Yellow fever virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that persists in an enzoonotic cycle in non-human primates (NHPs) in Brazil, causing disease in humans through spillover events. Yellow fever (YF) re-emerged in the early 2000s, spreading from the Amazon River basin towards the previously considered low-risk, southeastern region of the country. Previous methods mapping YF spillover risk do not incorporate the temporal dynamics and ecological context of the disease, and are therefore unable to predict seasonality in spatial risk across Brazil. We present the results of a bagged logistic regression predicting the propensity for YF spillover per municipality (administrative sub-district) in Brazil from environmental and demographic covariates aggregated by month. Ecological context was incorporated by creating National and Regional models of spillover dynamics, where the Regional model consisted of two separate models determined by the regions\xe2\x80\x99 NHP reservoir species richness (high vs low).'

Abstract: 'Secondary forests, created after heavy logging, are an important part of China\xe2\x80\x99s forests. We investigated forest biomass and its accumulation rate in 38 plots in a tropical secondary forest on Hainan Island. These secondary forests are moderate carbon sinks, averaging 1.96\xe2\x80\x932.17\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0a\xe2\x88\x921. Biomass increment is largely by medium-sized (10\xe2\x80\x9335\xc2\xa0m) trees. Tree mortality accounts for almost 30% of the biomass and plays a negligible role in biomass accumulation estimates. Mortality rate is highly dependent on tree size. For small trees and seedlings, it is related to competition due to elevated irradiance after logging. Regarding prospective biomass and rates of accumulation, recovery is not as rapid as in secondary forests of cleared land. Therefore, tropical forests are susceptible to logging operations and need careful forest management.'

Abstract: 'Increased trade in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been promoted as one possible means to slow tropical deforestation by increasing the economic value of intact forest. A market survey of NTFPs occurring in the Capim River basin in eastern Amazonia, Brazil demonstrated that the reality for many smallholder communities in frontier and remote regions includes chronic transportation difficulties, high variability in fruit production, perishable products and lack of market expertise. In some communities, declining abundance of NTFPs due to logging and fire has resulted in a lack of forest products to even meet subsistence needs. In areas close to cities where transportation is assured and where forest clearing has eroded the natural occurrence of some valuable native NTFPs, smallholders who manage and successfully market native fruit and medicinal species are overcoming these obstacles. In frontier regions undergoing rapid transformation, however, decline in locally used and regionally marketed NTFPs currently pose detrimental consequences for communities. Findings suggest that an overemphasis on NTFP marketing has diverted attention from local livelihood, resource access and subsistence issues.'

Abstract: 'Tall and short Amazonian caatinga at La Esmeralda (rainfall 2600 mm yr\xe2\x88\x921) are described and compared with those at San Carlos de R\xc3\xado Negro (3600 mm yr-1). The tall forests have much in common: thin-boled trees, many with scleromorphic mesophylls, lack of thick-stemmed climbers and of herbs, species paucity in all life-forms, domination by Eperua, and a high proportion of Bombacaceae, Clusiaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The short caatingas are also structurally and floristically similar but at La Esmeralda the notophyll scrubland species are lacking. At La Esmeralda, the common tree species are autochorous, but the majority of plants (particularly understorey species) are zoochorous. Relatively high transmission of light to the floor of the tall caatinga (1.5% PAR) may explain how trees with light-demanding architecture regenerate in the understorey. The presence of Cecropia and \xe2\x80\x98weedy\xe2\x80\x99 species in the caatinga only at San Carlos may be the result of greater human interference there. The soils at San Carlos and La Esmeralda are similar: thick humus overlying bleached sand, waterlogged most of the year. The water table at La Esmeralda drops to >1 m depth during the drier months, but tensiometers at 30 cm depth did not indicate significant water shortage. Soils are consistently wetter in the short caatinga than the tall. Shortage of nitrogen appears to determine the major structural and physiognomic features of the caatinga, and depth of aerated soil appears to determine its stature. Comparisons are made between tall caatinga, wallaba and swamp forest in the Guianas and heath forests of Malaysia.'

Abstract: 'We compared the resin-core and buried-bag incubation methods for estimating nitrogen (N) transformation rates using the 15N pool dilution technique in alluvial soils of an early successional forest (ESF) and an old-growth forest (OGF) at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Soil cores (38\xc3\x97100-mm) from both forests were incubated in situ for 7 days. The two methods gave generally similar estimates of net N mineralization rates for the two forests. Estimates of ammonium production by the resin-core method were higher than those by the buried-bag method in ESF, but did not differ significantly in OGF (p<0.05). Estimates of nitrate production by the two methods did not differ significantly. Nitrate averaged 74% and 81% of the total inorganic N production in ESF and OGF, respectively. Net N mineralization in ESF (6.6 mmol m-2d-1) did not differ significantly from that in OGF (5.0 mmol m-2d-1). Fluxes of ammonium and nitrate were high for both forests, but the OGF tended to have higher gross mineralization and nitrification rates than ESF. Approximately 60% of the gross nitrate production and less than 30% of the ammonium were immobilized by microorganisms.'

Abstract: 'We carried out a comprehensive literature review of the medicinal use of palms in northwestern South America and complemented it with a large number of field interviews. We investigated patterns of medicinal use across three ecoregions (Amazon, Andes, Choc\xc3\xb3), four countries (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia), and three human groups (indigenous, mestizos, and Afro-Americans). Overall, we reviewed 129 references with medicinal palm data and conducted 1956 field interviews, which yielded 93 medicinal palm species, 924 uses for the treatment of 157 diseases and ailments, and 1553 use-reports. The Amazon ecoregion showed the highest incidence of medicinal use, but overall use patterns were similar to those in the Andes and the Choc\xc3\xb3. Ecuador was the most intensively studied country, whereas our fieldwork demonstrated that the Andes of all countries, and the Choc\xc3\xb3 of Colombia could still yield more information. The most common medicinal uses were associated to Digestive system, Skin and subcutaneous tissue, Infections and infestations, and Respiratory system. The medicinal use of palms was clearly more prominent among the indigenous than amongst mestizos and Afro-Americans. Medicinal palm use was not random, but rather showed similar patterns across ecoregions and countries, covering the livelihoods and needs of primary health care, often unmet by Western health systems.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the rainfall climatology and variability over Central Equatorial Africa (CEA) has largely been hampered by the lack of adequate in situ observations and meteorological stations for the last three\xc2\xa0decades. Large differences and uncertainties among several observational and reanalysis data sets and various climate model simulations present another big challenge. This study comprehensively assesses the currently widely used reanalysis products based on quality-controlled radiosonde observations and a new gauge-based rainfall data set, NIC131, in order to identify the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d reanalysis products available over CEA. Among the seven reanalysis data sets (i.e., 20CR, CFSR, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, MERRA2, NCEP-1 and NCEP-2), MERRA2 is closest to NIC131 in reproducing the mean climatology and interannual variability and has the smallest biases and root-mean-square error (RMSE) in describing the observed wind fields in the lower- and middle-troposphere, and the two NCEP reanalyses can better capture geopotential height fields than the other reanalyses. Overall, the reanalyses capture the major features of the rainfall seasonal cycle and the seasonal evolution in the reference data but demonstrate an evident spread of spatiotemporal characteristics. By examining the moisture transport, we find that the differences in the lower- and middle-tropospheric circulation can reasonably explain the differences in the rainfall climatology among the reanalyses. Considering the large differences in horizontal and vertical wind fields among the seven reanalyses, we need to use the best reanalysis wind and moisture fields to explain the observed rainfall and associated circulation changes over CEA.'

Abstract: "This essay examines the Brazilian deforestation debate to explicate the beginnings of a post-modern theory of argumentation. Modernist argumentation reflects two distinct approaches, found in the deforestation controversy. The first approach, \xe2\x80\x98universal minimilization,\xe2\x80\x99 presumes that the survival of humanity is sufficient grounds upon which to base argument. The alternative, \xe2\x80\x98strategic manipulation,\xe2\x80\x99 results in argument being employed as a technical device to advance one's interest. In place of the modernist approach, we offer an ecocentric theory of argumentation. This conception calls for individuals to set aside differences in values to sustain humanity but at the same time to be sensitive to differences in costs and benefits that accrue from common efforts to persons differently situated. Additionally, this view operates with a tacit working assumption that environmental questions are not discrete entities to be evaluated separately. Rather, people must act collectively on a range of interconnected issues to ensure survival."

Abstract: 'Two approaches are frequently mentioned in proposals to use tropical forest maintenance as a carbon offset. One is to set up, specific reserves, funding the establishment, demarcation, and guarding of these units. Monitoring, in this case, consists of the relatively straightforward process of confirming that the forest stands in question continue to exist. In Amazonia, where large expanses of tropical forest still exist, the reserve approach has the logical weakness of being completely open to \xe2\x80\x9cleakage\xe2\x80\x9d: with the implantation of any given reserve, the people who would have been deforesting in the reserve area will probably continue to clear the same amount of forest somewhere else in the region. The second approach is through policy changes aimed at reducing the rate of clearing, but not limited to specific reserves or areas of forest. This second approach addresses more fundamental aspects of the tropical deforestation problem, but has the disadvantages of not assuring the permance of forest and of not resulting in a visible product that can be convincingly credited, to the existence of the project. In order for credit to be assigned to policy change projects, functioning models of the deforestation process must be developed that are capable of producing seenarios with and without different policy changes. This requires understanding the process of deforestation, which depends on monitoring in order to have information as a time series. Information is needed both from satellite imagery and from on-the-ground observations on who occupies the land and why the observed changes occur. Monitoring must be done by individual property if causal factors are to be identified reliably; this is best achieved using a database in a Geographical, Information System (GIS) that includes property boundaries. Once policy changes are made in practice, not only deforestation but also the policies themselves must be monitored. Deerees and laws are not the same as changes in practice; the initiation and continued application of changes must therefore be confirmed regularly. The value of carbon benefits from Amazonia depends directly on the credibility and transparency of monitoring. The great potential value of carbon maintenance in Amazonia should provide ample reason for Amazonian countries to strengthen and increase the transparency of their monitoring efforts.'

Abstract: ' Rapid turnover of organic matter leads to a low efficiency of organic fertilizers applied to increase and sequester C in soils of the humid tropics. Charcoal was reported to be responsible for high soil organic matter contents and soil fertility of anthropogenic soils (Terra Preta) found in central Amazonia. Therefore, we reviewed the available information about the physical and chemical properties of charcoal as affected by different combustion procedures, and the effects of its application in agricultural fields on nutrient retention and crop production. Higher nutrient retention and nutrient availability were found after charcoal additions to soil, related to higher exchange capacity, surface area and direct nutrient additions. Higher charring temperatures generally improved exchange properties and surface area of the charcoal. Additionally, charcoal is relatively recalcitrant and can therefore be used as a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2. Several aspects of a charcoal management system remain unclear, such as the role of microorganisms in oxidizing charcoal surfaces and releasing nutrients and the possibilities to improve charcoal properties during production under field conditions. Several research needs were identified, such as field testing of charcoal production in tropical agroecosystems, the investigation of surface properties of the carbonized materials in the soil environment, and the evaluation of the agronomic and economic effectiveness of soil management with charcoal.'

Abstract: 'Biometric inventories for 25 years, from 1983 to 2005, indicated that the Jianfengling tropical mountain rain forest in Hainan, China, was either a source or a modest sink of carbon. Overall, this forest was a small carbon sink with an accumulation rate of (0.56\xc2\xb10.22) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921yr\xe2\x88\x921, integrated from the long-term measurement data of two plots (P9201 and P8302). These findings were similar to those for African and American rain forests ((0.62\xc2\xb10.23) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921yr\xe2\x88\x921). The carbon density varied between (201.43\xc2\xb129.38) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 and (229.16\xc2\xb139.2) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921, and averaged (214.17\xc2\xb132.42) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 for plot P9201. Plot P8302, however, varied between (223.95\xc2\xb145.92) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 and (254.85\xc2\xb148.86) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921, and averaged (243.35\xc2\xb147.64) Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921. Quadratic relationships were found between the strength of carbon sequestration and heavy rainstorms and dry months. Precipitation and evapotranspiration are two major factors controlling carbon sequestration in the tropical mountain rain forest.'

Abstract: 'By drawing on quantitative studies in social anthropology, zoology, ethnobotany, and economics we present a method for conducting an economic valuation of non-timber forest products. A review of 24 studies suggests that the median value for non-timber forest products is about $50/ha/year. We discuss problems with past studies and suggest ways to get better estimates of output quantities, marginal costs, and prices.'

Abstract: 'Slash-and-burn agricultural systems have received a great deal of attention given their observed or hypothesized role in tropical deforestion, biodiversity loss, and contribution to global warming. These agricultural systems are varied; and such diversity has led to confusion in making cross-site comparisons. One hundred and three publications describing 136 cases were reviewed in order to develop a scheme to classify slash-and-burn systems. Four variables \xe2\x80\x94 initial vegetative cover, type of user, final cover, and fallow length \xe2\x80\x94 were used to describe each case. Nine groups representing the same or similar combinations of values were identified. Groups were keyed for placement of each case on a global map indicating geographic distribution. The method provides a way to establish similarities or differences among slash-and-burn cases (or representativeness of cases) to the degree that available literature represents what exists in the field. Researchers are invited to provide descriptors of additional cases, respective references, and case locations in order to improve and test the utility of the method and to simultaneously expand the resulting database.'

Abstract: 'The fishing and hunting performed by inhabitants of the Extractive Reserve of the Upper Juru\xc3\xa1, Acre, Brazil was studied, and an ecological analysis on the use of fish and game, including preferences, taboos and medicinal uses, and of fish abundance was made. Research was carried out at the Upper Juru\xc3\xa1 Extractive Reserve in three visits (1993 and 1994). A total of 143 individuals (101 families) living along the banks of the rivers Juru\xc3\xa1, Tejo, Bag\xc3\xa9, S. Jo\xc3\xa3o and Breu were interviewed, and 115 species of fish with set gillnets were collected. Local economic activities included rubber-tapping and small-scale agriculture. Fishing was especially important in the dry season, when cast net and hook and line were used. Hunting and game consumption were intensive in the wet season. Some local rules may be useful as starting points for local management, such as the use of fish diversity through lake management, the use of water level seasonality, hunting periods or quotas, and food taboos. The integration of academic research with indigenous knowledge and demands is important to develop management plans which protect both biological and cultural diversity.'

Abstract: 'This article examines transformations associated with changes in resource use and land cover dynamics in the community of S\xc3\xa3o Manoel, Maranh\xc3\xa3o state, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. The shifting cultivator peasants in S\xc3\xa3o Manoel integrate swidden fields for annual cropping, the extraction of babassu palm products, and pastures for cattle ranching. Since the early twentieth century, predominant vegetative cover patterns have been altered from species-rich mature forests to secondary succession with babassu dominant to pasture or swidden fields containing palm stands of various densities. A grounded political ecology of resource use in the area suggests that management strategies and the resulting land cover dynamics integrate site-specific decisions of peasant producers. I discuss the trajectory of production strategies in S\xc3\xa3o Manoel since the establishment of the community in the 1920s, and identify the multiple dimensions affecting resource use and environmental outcomes, with an emphasis on the period following land struggles and the recovery of peasant tenure rights in the mid-1980s. The analysis indicates that socionatural trajectories that optimize resource use and address the socioeconomic needs of the community include the maintenance of palm/pastures associations.'

Abstract: 'The effects in climate models of changes in albedo and soil moisture which are expected to follow from tropical deforestation are reviewed. The major results from experiments with tropical forest regions (a) forested (\xe2\x80\x98Experiment F\xe2\x80\x99) and (b) grass-covered (\xe2\x80\x98Experiment G\xe2\x80\x99) are compared over South America and Central Africa. Then, Experiment F is compared with \xe2\x80\x98Experiment 2\xe2\x80\x99 which has constant snowfree albedo of 0.2, close to that of grassland; in both South America and Zaire regions, the albedo changes for (G-F) and (2-F) are similar and, as Experiment 2 is an eight year run, assessments of the statistical significance can be made.'

Abstract: 'We reconstructed the palaeoenvironmental conditions of the last ca. 8,000\xc2\xa0years in the Tres Lagunas region of the Quimsacocha volcanic basin (ca. 3,800\xc2\xa0m a.s.l.) in the southwestern Ecuadorian Andes. By means of a pollen and charcoal record, we analysed vegetation, fire, and climate history of this area, which is sensitive to climatic changes of both the Pacific as well as of the eastern Andes and Amazon region. Sediment deposits, pronounced increases of pollen and charcoal concentrations, and pollen taxa reflect warmer and drier conditions in the early to mid-Holocene (~8000 to 3900\xc2\xa0cal. b.p.). During the late Holocene (2250 to \xe2\x88\x9257\xc2\xa0cal. b.p.), five warm and cold phases occurred at Quimsacocha. The most prominent cold phase possibly corresponds to the globally recognized Little Ice Age (LIA; ~600 to 100\xc2\xa0cal. b.p.). The cold phase signal at Quimsacocha was characterized by a higher abundance of Poaceae, Iso\xc3\xabtes and Gentianella, which are favoured by cold and moist conditions. Frequent charcoal particles can be recorded since the early to mid-Holocene (~7600 b.p.). The high Andean tree species Polylepis underwent several phases of degradation and re-establishment in the basin, which could indicate the use of fire by pre-Columbian settlers to enhance the growth of preferred herb species. The Tres Lagunas record suggests that human populations have been influencing the environment around Quimsacocha since the last ca. 8,000\xc2\xa0years.'

Abstract: 'This study provides a first thorough evaluation of the COnsortium for Small scale MOdeling weather prediction model in CLimate Mode (COSMO-CLM) over South America. Simulations are driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Besides precipitation, we examine the surface radiation budget, cloud cover, 2\xc2\xa0m temperatures, and the low level circulation. We evaluate against reanalysis data as well as observations from ground stations and satellites. Our analysis focuses on the sensitivity of results to the convective parametrization in comparison to their sensitivity to the representation of non-precipitating subgrid-scale clouds in the parametrization of radiation. Specifically, we compare simulations with a relative humidity versus a statistical subgrid-scale cloud scheme, in combination with convection schemes according to Tiedtke (Mon Weather Rev 117(8):1779\xe2\x80\x931800, 1989) and from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) cycle 33r1. The sensitivity of simulated tropical precipitation to the parametrizations of convection and subgrid-scale clouds is of similar magnitude. We show that model runs with different subgrid-scale cloud schemes produce substantially different cloud ice and liquid water contents. This impacts surface radiation budgets, and in turn convection and precipitation. Considering all evaluated variables in synopsis, the model performs best with the (both non-default) IFS and statistical schemes for convection and subgrid-scale clouds, respectively. Despite several remaining deficiencies, such as a poor simulation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation or a substantial austral summer warm bias in northern Argentina, this new setup considerably reduces long-standing model biases, which have been a feature of COSMO-CLM across tropical domains.'

Abstract: 'Although herbivory is widespread among insects, plant tissues rarely provide the optimal balance of nutrients for insect growth and reproduction. As a result, many herbivorous insects forage elsewhere for particular amino acids and minerals. Recent studies have shown that both herbivory and recruitment to sodium are commonplace among tropical rainforest ants, but little is known about how ants regulate their sodium intake at the individual and colony levels. In social insects, foragers may respond not only to their own nutritional deficiencies but also to those of their nestmates, who may have different nutritional requirements depending on their developmental stage, sex, or caste. Here, we investigate how salt stress among rainforest ants affects their preferences for salt and subsequent survival. We found that ants recruited more to salt than to any other bait type tested, confirming the strong preference for salt of ants in this region. Initially, we observed similarly high recruitment to salt among workers of the arboreal, herbivorous/omnivorous ant species Camponotus mirabilis. However, when provided with unrestricted access to high concentrations of salt, C. mirabilis workers suffered significantly higher mortality relative to controls, suggesting that C. mirabilis workers forage for sodium to the point of toxicity. Nonetheless, surviving workers showed reduced preference for salt at the end of the experiment, so some but not all individuals were able to regulate their salt intake beneath lethal dosages. We discuss how salt intake regulation may depend on colony members other than workers.'

Abstract: 'Published data and analyses from temperate and tropical aquatic systems are used to summarize knowledge about the potential impact of land-use alteration on the nitrogen biogeochemistry of tropical aquatic ecosystems, identify important patterns and recommend key needs for research. The tropical N-cycle is traced from pre-disturbance conditions through the phases of disturbance, highlighting major differences between tropical and temperate systems that might influence development strategies in the tropics. Analyses suggest that tropical freshwaters are more frequently N-limited than temperate zones, while tropical marine systems may show more frequent P limitation. These analyses indicate that disturbances to pristine tropical lands will lead to greatly increased primary production in freshwaters and large changes in tropical freshwater communities. Increased freshwater nutrient flux will also lead to an expansion of the high production, N- and light-limited zones around river deltas, a switch from P- to N-limitation in calcareous marine systems, with large changes in the community composition of fragile mangrove and reef systems. Key information gaps are highlighted, including data on mechanisms of nutrient transport and atmospheric deposition in the tropics, nutrient and material retention capacities of tropical impoundments, and N/P coupling and stoichiometric impacts of nutrient supplies on tropical aquatic communities. The current base of biogeochemical data suggests that alterations in the N-cycle will have greater impacts on tropical aquatic ecosystems than those already observed in the temperate zone.'

Abstract: 'The palm (Arecaceae) community on low paleo-riverine terraces (terrace forest) in the north-western Amazon, is described, and we assessed the importance of environmental differences and geographic distance as drivers of its local (252 grain and 0\xe2\x80\x93500 extent) and regional scale (5002 grain and 0.3\xe2\x80\x93143 km extent) beta diversity using ordination, multiple regressions on distance matrices and Indicator Species Analysis. A total of 15,869 individuals and 37 species of palm were sampled in 10 terrace forest transects, while 3758 individuals and 21 species were sampled in two adjacent floodplain forest transects for comparison. The terrace and floodplain forest were clearly different in their diversity and floristic composition. The relative importance of geographical distance and environmental difference as controls of terrace forest beta diversity was scale dependent, with environmental differences, notably in soil moisture, dominating at local scales and geographical distance dominating at regional scales. In fact, none of the environmental factors had a significant influence on regional-scale beta diversity. The geographical distance decay in floristic similarity was markedly steeper at local scale ( \xe2\x88\x920.25\xc2\xa0km \xe2\x88\x921) than at regional scale ( \xe2\x88\x920.003\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x88\x921). Such a nonlinear decay is expected if simple dispersal limitation controls beta diversity. However, the absent flattening of the distance decay at the largest distances and the sub-Andean affinities of the westernmost palm communities suggest that large-scale biogeographical processes also contribute to the regional-scale beta diversity. Hereby our results indicate that not only local environment, but also dispersal limitation and biogeographical history can be important controls of the diversity and composition of local plant communities.'

The current base of biogeochemical data suggests that alterations in the N-cycle will have greater impacts on tropical aquatic ecosystems than those already observed in the temperate zone.'

Abstract: 'Projections of drought hazard (dH) changes have been mapped from five bias-corrected climate models and analyzed at the global level under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The motivation for this study is the observation that drought risk is increasing globally and the effective regulation of prevention and adaptation measures depends on dH magnitude and its distribution for the future. Based on the Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation index, dH changes have been assessed for mid-(2021\xe2\x80\x932050) and late-century (2071\xe2\x80\x932099). With a few exceptions, results show a likely increase in global dH between the historical years (1971\xe2\x80\x932000) and both future time periods under all RCPs. Notwithstanding this worsening trend, it was found that projections of dH changes for most regions are neither robust nor significant in the near-future. By the end of the century, greater increases are projected for RCPs describing stronger radiative forcing. Under RCP8.5, statistically significant dH changes emerge for global Mediterranean ecosystems and the Amazon region, which are identified as possible hotspots for future water security issues. Taken together, projections of dH changes point towards two dilemmas: (1) in the near-term, stake-holders are left worrying about projected increasing dH over large regions, but lack of actionable model agreement to take effective decisions related to local prevention and adaptation initiatives; (2) in the long-term, models demonstrate remarkable agreement, but stake-holders lack actionable knowledge to manage potential impacts far distant from actual human-dominated environments. We conclude that the major challenge for risk management is not to adapt human populations or their activities to dH changes, but to progress on global initiatives that mitigate their impacts in the whole carbon cycle by late-century.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we analyze results from 47-year (1954\xe2\x80\x932000) offline simulations using an Australian land-surface model CSIRO Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange. We focus on exploring its surface mean climatology, interannual and decadal variations in Australia and Amazonia basin in South America which are distinguished by dry and wet climates respectively. Its skill is assessed by using observational datasets and four model products from the Global Land-surface Data Assimilation System. Surface evaporation and runoff climatologies are satisfactorily simulated, including surface energy and water partitions in dry and wet climates. In the Australian continent dominated by dry climate, slowly varying soil moisture processes are simulated in the southeast during austral winter. The model is skilful in reproducing the nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff variations in the southwestern part of the Australia. It shows that the significant downward trend of river inflow in the region is associated with enhanced surface evaporation which is caused by increased surface radiation and wind speed. In its carbon-cycle modeling, the model simulates an upward trend of NPP by about 0.69%/year over the Amazonia forest region in the 47-year period. By comparing two sets of the model results with/without CO2 variations, it shows that 35% of such increases are caused by changes in climatic conditions, while 65% is due to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Given the close linkage between climate, water and vegetation (carbon cycle), this work promotes an integrated modeling and evaluation approach for better representation of land-surface processes in Earth system studies.'

Abstract: 'Nutrient loss from forest ecosystems by burning and leaching can be estimated by comparing nutrient stores before and after the disturbance, and by measuring the nutrient fluxes during disturbance. We applied both methods to a clear cutting experiment near Belem, Eastern Amazon, in a correct time series of 15 months duration. Nutrient flux measurements include wood export, loss to the atmosphere by burning, and leaching. The latter was based on water flux simulation with a soil water model, and on element analysis of soil water extracts (ceramic cup lysimeter). Two plots with 33 and 92\xe2\x80\x89t\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921 of residual biomass (left after export of wood >7\xe2\x80\x89cm diameter) were compared with a forest control plot. Store and flux balances agreed well in case of Na, K, Mg, and S, and partially also for Ca and total P. Deviations seem to be caused by erratic but statistically not significant variations of the soil stores (mainly C and total N). Spacial variability of soil parameters demand very high sample replication, especially after disturbance. Flux measurements are better but more costly.'

Abstract: 'The effects of deep convection on the potential for forming ozone (\xe2\x80\x9cozone production potential\xe2\x80\x9d) in the free troposphere have been simulated for regions where the trace gas composition is influenced by biomass burning. Cloud dynamical and photochemical simulations based on observations in 1980 and 1985 Brazilian campaigns form the basis of a sensitivity study of the ozone production potential under differing conditions. The photochemical fate of pollutants actually entrained in a cumulus event of August 1985 during NASA/GTE/ABLE 2A (Case 1) is compared to photochemical ozone production that could have occurred if the same storm had been located closer to regions of savanna burning (Case 2) and forest burning (Case 3). In each case studied, the ozone production potential is calculated for a 24-hour period following convective redistribution of ozone precursors and compared to ozone production in the absence of convection. In all cases there is considerably more ozone formed in the middle and upper troposphere when convection has redistributed NOx, hydrocarbons and CO compared to the case of no convection.'

Abstract: 'Chagas disease is a complex anthropozoonosis with distinct domestic and sylvatic mammal species acting as potential reservoirs. The diversity of vector species and their habitats are among the factors that hinder the control of the disease. Control programs periodically monitor the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in insect bugs through microscopical observation of diluted feces. However, microscopy presents limited sensitivity in samples with low parasite numbers, difficulties in examining all evolutionary stages of the insect and may in turn be limited to differentiate T. cruzi from other morphologically similar trypanosomatids. Here, we report two highly sensitive and accurate methodologies to infer T. cruzi infection rates and to quantify parasite load in the gut of field-collected triatomines.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian cerrado savanna covers nearly 2\xc2\xa0million km2 and has a high incidence on foliage of various liquid food sources such as extrafloral nectar and insect exudates. These liquid rewards generate intense ant activity on cerrado foliage, making ant\xe2\x80\x93plant\xe2\x80\x93herbivore interactions especially prevalent in this biome. We present data on the distribution and abundance of extrafloral nectaries in the woody flora of cerrado communities and in the flora of other habitats worldwide, and stress the relevance of liquid food sources (including hemipteran honeydew) for the ant fauna. Consumption by ants of plant and insect exudates significantly affects the activity of the associated herbivores of cerrado plant species, with varying impacts on the reproductive output of the plants. Experiments with an ant\xe2\x80\x93plant\xe2\x80\x93butterfly system unequivocally demonstrate that the behavior of both immature and adult lepidopterans is closely related to the use of a risky host plant, where intensive visitation by ants can have a severe impact on caterpillar survival. We discuss recent evidence suggesting that the occurrence of liquid rewards on leaves plays a key role in mediating the foraging ecology of foliage-dwelling ants, and that facultative ant\xe2\x80\x93plant mutualisms are important in structuring the community of canopy arthropods. Ant-mediated effects on cerrado herbivore communities can be revealed by experiments performed on wide spatial scales, including many environmental factors such as soil fertility and vegetation structure. We also present some research questions that could be rewarding to investigate in this major neotropical savanna.'

Abstract: 'Using sequence data of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, we investigated phylogeographic differentiation of the Amazonian tortoise species Chelonoidis carbonaria and C. denticulata. While C. carbonaria is generally restricted to savannah habitats and adjacent forests, C. denticulata is associated with wet tropical and subtropical forests. Our study suggests a correlation between distinct habitat preferences and phylogeography of the two species. In Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses, haplotypes of C. carbonaria cluster in several distinct clades reflecting the species\xe2\x80\x99 patchy distribution in savannah habitats. By contrast, haplotypes of C. denticulata are only weakly differentiated; a finding also confirmed by parsimony network analysis. This suggests that the contiguous Amazonian rainforest allows gene flow between populations of the forest-dwelling C. denticulata throughout the range, but significantly impedes gene flow in C. carbonaria. The phylogeographic structure and extant distribution pattern of C. carbonaria is supportive of former Amazonian rainforest fragmentation, enabling the dispersal of savannah species. Based on fossil calibration, we dated divergence times for the C. carbonaria clades using a relaxed molecular clock, resulting in average estimates ranging from 4.0\xe2\x80\x932.2\xc2\xa0mya. This implies that the onset of rainforest fragmentation could predate the Pleistocene considerably. Furthermore, our findings call for further research on geographic and taxonomic variation in C. carbonaria and for a reassessment of the conservation status of the distinct genetic units.'

Abstract: 'We investigated a strategy to improve predicting capacity of plot-scale above-ground biomass (AGB) by fusion of LiDAR and Landsat5 TM derived biophysical variables for subtropical rainforest and eucalypts dominated forest in topographically complex landscapes in North-eastern Australia. Investigation was carried out in two study areas separately and in combination. From each plot of both study areas, LiDAR derived structural parameters of vegetation and reflectance of all Landsat bands, vegetation indices were employed. The regression analysis was carried out separately for LiDAR and Landsat derived variables individually and in combination. Strong relationships were found with LiDAR alone for eucalypts dominated forest and combined sites compared to the accuracy of AGB estimates by Landsat data. Fusing LiDAR with Landsat5 TM derived variables increased overall performance for the eucalypt forest and combined sites data by describing extra variation (3% for eucalypt forest and 2% combined sites) of field estimated plot-scale above-ground biomass. In contrast, separate LiDAR and imagery data, and fusion of LiDAR and Landsat data performed poorly across structurally complex closed canopy subtropical rainforest. These findings reinforced that obtaining accurate estimates of above ground biomass using remotely sensed data is a function of the complexity of horizontal and vertical structural diversity of vegetation.'

Abstract: "Fish is an important concentrator of mono-methyl mercury and the main route to human contamination. We compared fish Hg bioaccumulation (within similar weight ranges) in two Amazonian river habitats during high-water seasons. The Rio Madeira has been greatly impacted by agriculture, alluvial gold extraction, and a hydroelectric reservoir, whereas the Rio Negro is much less affected by these human activities. The species at the top of the food web, Hoplias malabaricus (piscivorous; 80-668 ng Hg/g) and Cichla spp. (piscivorous; 42\xe2\x80\x93747 ng Hg/g) showed the highest range of Hg concentrations. Nonpiscivorous species with comparable weight range, such as Potamorhina latior (detritivorous; 20\xe2\x80\x93157 ng Hg/g) and Myleus torquatus (herbivorous; 2\xe2\x80\x93182 ng Hg/g), had lower Hg concentrations. Triportheus elongatus (omnivorous; 5\xe2\x80\x93350 ng Hg/g), with the lowest weight range, also showed a low range of Hg concentrations. Despite the Rio Madeira's higher sediment load as well as environmental impacts (deforestation, agriculture, hydroelectric reservoir, and alluvial gold mining) on natural Hg release, fish Hg bioaccumulation was no different between the two river habitats for nonpiscivorous species. In this small observational study only the species at the top of the food web (M. torquatus, Cichla spp, T. elongatus) showed higher mean Hg concentrations in the Rio Madeira than the dominantly wilderness habitat of the Rio Negro."

Abstract: 'The study estimated, for the first time, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with cattle raising in Brazil, focusing on the period from 2003 to 2008 and the three principal sources: 1) portion of deforestation resulting in pasture establishment and subsequent burning of felled vegetation; 2) pasture burning; and 3) bovine enteric fermentation. Deforestation for pasture establishment was only considered for the Amazon and Cerrado. Emissions from pasture burning and enteric fermentation were accounted for the entire country. The consolidated emissions estimate lies between approximately 813 Mt CO2eq in 2008 (smallest value) and approximately 1,090 Mt CO2eq in 2003 (greatest value). The total emissions associated with Amazon cattle ranching ranged from 499 to 775 Mt CO2eq, that of the Cerrado from 229 to 231 Mt CO2eq, and that of the rest of the country between 84 and 87 Mt CO2eq. The full set of emissions originating from cattle raising is responsible for approximately half of all Brazilian emissions (estimated to be approximately 1,055 Mt CO2eq in 2005), even without considering cattle related sources not explicitly estimated in this study, such as energy use for transport and refrigeration along the beef and derivatives supply chain. The potential for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions offered by the Brazilian cattle industry is very high and might constitute Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s most important opportunity for emissions mitigation. The study offers a series of policy recommendations for mitigation that can be implemented by public and private administrators at a low cost relative to other greenhouse gas reduction options.'

Abstract: 'The exact size of the wetland area of South America is not known but may comprise as much as 20% of the sub-continent, with river floodplains and intermittent interfluvial wetlands as the most prominent types. A few wetland areas have been well studied, whereas little is known about others, including some that are very large. Despite the fact that most South American countries have signed the Ramsar convention, efforts to elaborate basic data have been insufficient, thereby hindering the formulation of a wetland-friendly policy allowing the sustainable management of these areas. Until now, the low population density in many wetland areas has provided a high level of protection; however, the pressure on wetland integrity is increasing, mainly as a result of land reclamation for agriculture and animal ranching, infrastructure building, pollution, mining activities, and the construction of hydroelectric power plants. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted increasing temperatures, accelerated melting of the glaciers in Patagonia and the Andes, a rise in sea level of 20\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm, and an increase in extreme multiannual and short-term climate events (El Ni\xc3\xb1o and La Ni\xc3\xb1a, heavy rains and droughts, heat waves). Precipitation may decrease slightly near the Caribbean coast as well as over large parts of Brazil, Chile, and Patagonia, but increase in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, around the equator, and in southeastern South America. Of even greater impact may be a change in rainfall distribution, with precipitation increasing during the rainy season and decreasing during the dry season. There is no doubt that the predicted changes in global climate will strongly affect South American wetlands, mainly those with a low hydrologic buffer capacity. However, for the coming decades, wetland destruction by wetland-unfriendly development planning will by far outweigh the negative impacts of global climate change. South American governments must bear in mind that there are many benefits that wetlands bring about for the landscape and biodiversity as well as for humans. While water availability will be the key problem for the continent\xe2\x80\x99s cities and agroindustries, intact wetlands can play a major role in storing water, buffering river and stream discharges, and recharging subterranean aquifers.'

Abstract: 'We present estimates of total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes in rivers to the North Atlantic Ocean from 14 regions in North America, South America, Europe, and Africa which collectively comprise the drainage basins to the North Atlantic. The Amazon basin dominates the overall phosphorus flux and has the highest phosphorus flux per area. The total nitrogen flux from the Amazon is also large, contributing 3.3 Tg yr\xe2\x88\x921 out of a total for the entire North Atlantic region of 13.1 Tg yr\xe2\x88\x921 . On a per area basis, however, the largest nitrogen fluxes are found in the highly disturbed watersheds around the North Sea, in northwestern Europe, and in the northeastern U.S., all of which have riverine nitrogen fluxes greater than 1,000 kg N km\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921.'

Abstract: 'Our review focuses on the projections of climate change in the Brazilian semiarid region, the Caatinga, based on recent publications about global climate change and biology. We found several vulnerable points in the initial estimates, the main one being that the data were collected and analyzed without a multidisciplinary knowledge. This review discusses several studies that show the current knowledge in many semiarid regions around the world. Some of these studies argue for the increase in vegetation greenness responses even under severe and prolonged drought, based on the high resilience the Caatinga native species show under severe drought conditions over the years. Additionally, we include in this review recent data produced by our group on key ecophysiological variables under drought conditions. We also show successful examples of deforested areas recovery in the semiarid region of the Central America. It is critical that the recovery of semiarid areas is coupled with the implementation of socio-environmental policies, engaging the local population and providing subsidies for life wealth improvement. These are key aspects for a long-term recovery and conservation of the Brazilian dry tropical forest.'

Abstract: 'We characterized stand structure and floristic composition of woody life forms in three, 16\xe2\x80\x9318 yr old secondary stands that regenerated after pasture abandonment, and three nearby old-growth stands of tropical rain forest in lowland Costa Rica. Basal area and stem density for each of four plant size classes (seedlings, saplings, treelets, trees) were similar among stand types, but density of adult canopy palms (individuals \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm DBH), was lower in the secondary stands. We estimate that 15% of the basal area of stems \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm DBH correspond to remnant trees in our secondary stands. The observed rapid woody regrowth compared to other published studies in the lowland neotropics, can be attributed to moderate land use and possibly, to the influence of nutrient-rich volcanic soils in the study area. Overall, plant species richness was lower in the secondary stands, but this difference was less pronounced in the smallest size classes (seedlings, saplings). Median percent similarity of all pairwise stand comparisons showed that floristic composition of saplings (stems \xe2\x89\xa5 1 m tall and \xe2\x89\xa5 5 cm DBH) was more similar between secondary and old-growth stands than for trees (stems \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm DBH). Because the potential value of secondary forests in conserving woody plant diversity appears highest for the young size classes, we suggest that further studies on floristic composition, especially those addressing the dynamics of the understory component, are needed to refine our understanding of the role of this natural resource in the maintenance of plant biodiversity in disturbed landscapes.'

Abstract: 'The threat to tropical forests is often gauged in terms of deforestation rates and the total area remaining. Recently, however, there has been a growing realization that forest can appear intact on a satellite image yet be biologically degraded or vulnerable to degradation. The array of direct threats to humid tropical forest biodiversity, in addition to deforestation, includes: selective extraction of plants; selective extraction of animals; biological invasion; fragmentation; climate change; changing atmospheric composition; and increasing tree turnover rates. The threats are linked to one another by a poorly understood network of causality and feedback effects. Moreover, their potential impacts on forest biodiversity are hard to assess because each threat is as likely to precipitate indirect effects as direct effects, and because several threats are likely to interact synergistically with one another. In spite of the uncertainties, it is clear that the biological health of tropical forests can become seriously degraded as a result of these threats, and it is unlikely that any tropical forest will escape significant ecological changes. Some groups of plants and animals are likely to benefit at the expense of others. Species diversity is expected to decline as a consequence of the changes in forest ecology. In the 21st century scientists and conservationists will be increasingly challenged to monitor, understand, prevent and head off these threats.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forest ecosystems are large stores of carbon which supply millions of people with life support requirements. Currently tropical forests are undergoing massive deforestation. Here, I address the possible impact of global change conditions, including elevated CO2, temperature rise, and nitrogen deposition on forest structure and dynamics. Tropical forests may be particularly susceptible to climate change for the following reasons: (1) Phenological events (such as flowering and fruiting) are highly tuned to climatic conditions. Thus a small change in climate can have a major impact on the forest, its biological diversity and its role in the carbon cycle. (2) There are strong coevolutionary interactions, such as pollination seed dispersal, with a high degree of specialization, i.e., only certain animals can effect these activities for certain species. Global change can decouple these tight coevolutionary interactions. (3) Because of high species diversity per unit area, species of the tropical rain forest must have narrow niches. Thus changes in global climate can eliminate species and therefore reduce biological diversity. (4) Deforestation and other forms of disturbance may have significant feedback on hydrology both regionally and globally. The predicted decline in the rainfall in the Amazon Basin and the intensification of the Indian monsoon can have a large effect on water availability and floods which are already devastating low-lying areas. It is concluded that tropical forests may be very sensitive to climate change. Under climatic change conditions their structure and function may greatly change, their integrity may be violated and their services to people may be greatly modified. Because they are large stores of great biological diversity, they require immediate study before it is too late. The study requires the collaboration of scientists with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences including biologists, climate modellers, atmospheric scientists, economists, human demographers and sociologists in order to carry out holistic and urgently needed work. Global climatic change brings a great challenge to science and to policy makers.'

Abstract: 'The influence of plant species on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics was investigated in lowland Amazonia, Brazil under plantations of tree species with varied phenologies, resource requirements, and chemical characteristics in fine litter. Seasonal N dynamics were studied in replicated stands of Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis Barrett & Golfari, Euxylophora paraensis Hub., Carapa guianensis Aubl., a Leguminosae combination (Dalbergia nigra Fr. All., Dinizia excelsa Ducke, Parkia multijuga Benth.), and native forest in the Curu\xc3\xa1-Una Forest Reserve, Par\xc3\xa1, Brazil. Textural, mineralogical, and chemical soil properties at 1 m depth under the plantations and the forest indicated that initial soil properties were similar. Net annual N mineralization ranged from 195 kg ha-1 (P. caribaea) to 328 kg ha-1 (forest), and was related to fine root N contents in the surface root mat (R2 = 0.96, p = 0.01). Net annual N mineralization was also inversely related to within-stand nitrogen-use efficiency (R2 = 0.81, p = 0.04). These results suggest that tree species or groups of species with varied N-use efficiencies altered soil N transformation rates in a predictable manner.'

Abstract: 'About half of the Amazon rainforest is subject to seasonal droughts of 3\xc2\xa0months or more. Despite this drought, several studies have shown that these forests, under a strongly seasonal climate, do not exhibit significant water stress during the dry season. In addition to deep soil water uptake, another contributing explanation for the absence of plant water stress during drought is the process of hydraulic redistribution; the nocturnal transfer of water by roots from moist to dry regions of the soil profile. Here, we present data on patterns of soil moisture and sap flow in roots of three dimorphic-rooted species in the Tapaj\xc3\xb3s Forest, Amaz\xc3\xb4nia, which demonstrate both upward (hydraulic lift) and downward hydraulic redistribution. We measured sap flow in lateral and tap roots of our three study species over a 2-year period using the heat ratio method, a sap-flow technique that allows bi-directional measurement of water flow. On certain nights during the dry season, reverse or acropetal flow (i.e.,in the direction of the soil) in the lateral roots and positive or basipetal sap flow (toward the plant) in the tap roots of Coussarea racemosa (caferana), Manilkara huberi (ma\xc3\xa7aranduba) and Protium robustum (breu) were observed, a pattern consistent with upward hydraulic redistribution (hydraulic lift). With the onset of heavy rains, this pattern reversed, with continuous night-time acropetal sap flow in the tap root and basipetal sap flow in lateral roots, indicating water movement from wet top soil to dry deeper soils (downward hydraulic redistribution). Both patterns were present in trees within a rainfall exclusion plot (Seca Floresta) and to a more limited extent in the control plot. Although hydraulic redistribution has traditionally been associated with arid or strongly seasonal environments, our findings now suggest that it is important in ameliorating water stress and improving rain infiltration in Amazonian rainforests. This has broad implications for understanding and modeling ecosystem process and forest function in this important biome.'

Abstract: 'Wecompared five-year old forests developing after agriculture to those recoveringfrom Hurricane Joan (1988) and to the pre-hurricane forest, at two sites intropical rain forest in southeastern Nicaragua. We used non-parametric clusteranalysis to group transects by their species compositions, and compared theirspecies richness, estimated total species richness, dominance, density andbasalarea. Post-agriculture transects showed distinctive species compositions andlower diversity than post-hurricane transects, which were in turn more similarto the pre-hurricane forest. These results are similar to those found by otherresearchers in the Amazon and in Puerto Rico. Land use history was moreimportant than proximity in the landscape in determining the composition andstructure of post-disturbance forests in this region.'

Abstract: 'Several lines of evidence suggest that nitrogen in most tropical forests is relatively more available than N in most temperate forests, and even that it may function as an excess nutrient in many tropical forests. If this is correct, tropical forests should have more open N cycles than temperate forests, with both inputs and outputs of N large relative to N cycling within systems. Consequent differences in both the magnitude and the pathways of N loss imply that tropical forests should in general be more15N enriched than are most temperate forests. In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the nitrogen stable isotopic composition of tree leaves and soils from a variety of tropical and temperate forests. Foliar \xce\xb415N values from tropical forests averaged 6.5\xe2\x80\xb0 higher than from temperate forests. Within the tropics, ecosystems with relatively low N availability (montane forests, forests on sandy soils) were significantly more depleted in15N than other tropical forests. The average \xce\xb415N values for tropical forest soils, either for surface or for depth samples, were almost 8\xe2\x80\xb0 higher than temperate forest soils. These results provide another line of evidence that N is relatively abundant in many tropical forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Because clearing forest for agriculture is the most common disturbance in the Neotropics, studies of post-agricultural recovery need to be conducted, both to understand rain-forest function and structure and to address important social issues such as deforestation, restoration, and sustainability. To assist that effort, the clearing, planting, cultivation, harvesting, and abandonment practices for common crops in the Neotropics, the post-agricultural environment and disturbance regime, and the recovery mechanisms are reviewed for their influence on the succession that follows abandonment. An important focus is on the four historical effects, or signatures, of crops: crop persistence, crop root exudate persistence, persistence of associated species, and indirect effects of herbicide and fertilization regimes. In addition, the effects of cattle introduced after cropping, such as hummock creation, soil compaction, and dung deposition, are discussed. Further, permanent plot tree data from Puerto Rico and Ecuador are summarized to guide an understanding of how trees invade and replace themselves. Finally, tabular summaries of completed Neotropical seed/seedling/sapling field experiments are used, both to examine what is known about the mechanisms of old-field succession in the Neotropics and to suggest research directions and successful restoration strategies. A species-specific and field type-specific investigation of tree-replacement mechanisms in the future is suggested, leading to replacement modeling using data from permanent plots.'

Abstract: 'It is well documented that the negative effects of habitat fragmentation are strong enough to promote local as well as regional extinction of canopy and emergent trees in neotropical forests. However, forest fragmentation does not occur alone, but is always associated with other human-induced threats to trees, such as logging, forest burning and hunting of key vertebrate seed dispersers within forest remnants. This association occurs because forest resources are, at least during a certain period, the main income source for local human populations. It is now possible to establish how these threats act in concert causing tree species impoverishment. Based on a predictive model, it is predicted that the most fragmented forest regions have lost or will lose an important part of their tree diversity. New integrated research must urgently test this prediction and investigate how human activities might be regulated in both old and new tropical forest frontiers to avoid species loss. If we fail to do this we will miss the opportunity of proposing sound and efficient guidelines to rescue neotropical forests from species impoverishment.'

Abstract: 'The extensive medicinal plant knowledge of Amazonian tribal peoples is widely recognized in the scientific literature and celebrated in popular lore. Despite this broad interest, the ethnomedical systems and knowledge of disease which guide indigenous utilization of botanical diversity for healing remain poorly characterized and understood. No study, to our knowledge, has attempted to directly examine patterns of actual disease recognition and treatment by healers of an Amazonian indigenous culture.'

Abstract: 'Several lines of evidence suggest that nitrogen in most tropical forests is relatively more available than N in most temperate forests, and even that it may function as an excess nutrient in many tropical forests. If this is correct, tropical forests should have more open N cycles than temperate forests, with both inputs and outputs of N large relative to N cycling within systems. Consequent differences in both the magnitude and the pathways of N loss imply that tropical forests should in general be more 15N enriched than are most temperate forests. In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the nitrogen stable isotopic composition of tree leaves and soils from a variety of tropical and temperate forests. Foliar \xce\xb415N values from tropical forests averaged 6.5\xe2\x80\xb0 higher than from temperate forests. Within the tropics, ecosystems with relatively low N availability (montane forests, forests on sandy soils) were significantly more depleted in 15N than other tropical forests. The average \xce\xb415N values for tropical forest soils, either for surface or for depth samples, were almost 8\xe2\x80\xb0 higher than temperate forest soils. These results provide another line of evidence that N is relatively abundant in many tropical forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Soil inorganic nitrogen pools, net mineralization and net nitrification rates were compared during the dry season along a chronosequence of upland (terra firme) forest, 3-, 9- and 20-year-old pastures in the western Brazilian Amazon Basin state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia to investigate the influence of forest conversion to pasture on soil nitrogen cycles. Surface soil (0 to 10 cm) from forest had larger extractable inorganic nitrogen pools than pasture soils. In the forest, NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  pools equaled or exceeded NH 4 +  pools, while pasture inorganic N pools consisted almost exclusively of NH 4 + . Rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification in seven -day laboratory incubations were higher in the seven - day forest than in the pastures. Net N mineralization rates did not differ significantly among different-aged pastures, but net nitrification rates were significantly lower in the 20-year-old pasture. Higher net N mineralization and net nitrification rates were measured in laboratory and in situ incubations of sieved soil, compared with in situ incubations of intact soil cores. Rates calculated in seven-day incubations were higher than determined by longer incubations. Sieving may increase N mineralization and/or decrease N immobilization compared with intact cores. We concluded that 7-day laboratory incubation of sieved soil was the most useful index for comparing N availability across the chronosequence of forest and pasture sites. High net nitrification rates in forest soils suggest a potential for NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  losses either through leaching or gaseous emissions.'

Abstract: 'Land-use allocation has important implications for the conservation and management of tropical forests. Peru\xe2\x80\x99s forestry regime has recently been reformed and more than 7 million ha has been assigned as forest concessions. This potentially has a drastic impact on the land-use practices and species composition of the assigned areas. Nevertheless, the environmental variation found within the concessions and the process applied to delimit them are poorly studied and documented. Thus, it is difficult to estimate the biological impacts of forestry activities in concessions or plan them sustainably. This paper reveals the characteristics of the current concession allocation in Loreto, Peruvian Amazonia, using environmental and access-related variables and compares the concessions to other major land-use assignments. The work draws on a number of data sets describing land-use, ecosystem diversity, and fluvial network in the region. According to our data, certain environment types such as relatively fertile Pebas soils are overrepresented in the concessions, while others, like floodplain forests, are underrepresented in comparison to other land-use assignments. Concessions also have less anthropogenic disturbance than other areas. Furthermore, concessions are located on average further from the river network than the other land-use assignments studied. We claim that forest classification based on productivity, soil fertility, accessibility, and biodiversity patterns is an achievable long-term goal for forest authorities in Peru, and in many other tropical countries. We present a rough design of a geographic information system incorporating environmental, logging, and access-related data that could be applied to approach this goal in Peru.'

Abstract: 'Modern sloths are among the more characteristic mammals of South and Central American faunas. Recent discovery in four Paleogene, 22 Neogene, and dozens of Pleistocene fossiliferous localities in the tropics has revealed an unexpected paleobioversity constituted by some 81 fossil sloth species. Probably originating in southern South America near the Eocene/Oligocene transition, sloths were represented in the tropics during the late Oligocene by Pseudoglyptodon, Mylodontidae, and Megalonychidae. The latter occupied the West Indies between at least the late early Miocene and late Pleistocene, and two mylodontid clades, Octodontobradyinae and Urumacotheriinae, were characteristic of Amazonian localities from the Colhuehuapian and the Laventan periods, respectively, until the end of the Miocene. Megatheriinae and Nothrotheriidae appeared during the middle Miocene, colonizing the tropics and then North America, where Mylodontidae and Megalonychidae had already been present since the early late Miocene. Nothrotheriids are more abundant and diversified during the late Miocene in the tropics than in southern South America. Remains closely related to either of the modern sloths are absent from the fossil record, including those in the tropics. The characteristic suspensory posture of Bradypus and Choloepus appeared independently and likely after the Miocene epoch, and thus well after the hypothesized split suggested by molecular studies of the respective clades of these genera. Given their current widespread distribution in and reliance on the tropics, prospecting efforts for the direct fossil kin of suspensory sloths should concentrate on deposits in the Amazonian region, as this area has shown promise in producing fossil sloths.'

Abstract: 'Human-caused disturbance to tropical rainforests\xe2\x80\x94such as logging and fire\xe2\x80\x94causes substantial losses of carbon stocks. This is a critical issue to be addressed in the context of policy discussions to implement REDD+. This work reviews current scientific knowledge about the temporal dynamics of degradation-induced carbon emissions to describe common patterns of emissions from logging and fire across tropical forest regions. Using best available information, we: (i) develop short-term emissions factors (per area) for logging and fire degradation scenarios in tropical forests; and (ii) describe the temporal pattern of degradation emissions and recovery trajectory post logging and fire disturbance.'

Abstract: 'Protected forest areas of Sulawesi are gradually being replaced by intensively used agroforestry systems and farmland, especially in lowland and sub-montane regions. Studies on the impact of these man-induced changes on biodiversity are of urgent conservation concern. We compared the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage of a natural hill forest to that of a disturbed hill forest, representing a mosaic of old secondary forest and recently abandoned or active subsistence farms. Overall, species richness seemed highest in the disturbed site, but both abundance and diversity of endemic butterflies were significantly higher in the natural forest. Although the butterfly assemblage showed a clear vertical structure in the natural forest, vertical stratification was no longer pronounced at the disturbed site. Comparative studies based on diversity estimates from ground samples should consider not only the scale at which sampling is carried out and influences from nearby habitat patches in the surrounding landscape mosaic, but also possible behavioural changes in stratified species after forest modification. This study shows that higher overall species richness does not imply higher species distinctiveness, and indicates that the contribution of land-use systems to global biodiversity should be evaluated with caution, even when relatively high species richness estimates are found.'

Abstract: 'We evaluate the spatio-temporal variability of atmospheric moisture in northern South America. The spatial structure of moisture is discussed in seasonal and interannual time scales. We combine the principal component analysis of moisture flux divergence and the physical information flow to measure the relative influence of global climate phenomena in the leading modes of regional variability. Our results highlight the inherent complexity of spatial structure in this region due to the interaction of the Tropical Andes, the regional circulation changes related to the annual migration of the ITCZ, the low-level jet structures of regional atmospheric transport and the moisture transport from surrounding marine areas. Modes of variability related to oscillations in the tropical and extratropical Atlantic and Tropical Pacific are the most important sources of variability underlying the regional atmospheric moisture. To emphasize ENSO related variability, we propose a seasonal state classification index that unambiguously classifies the local evolution of precipitation in El Ni\xc3\xb1o and La Ni\xc3\xb1a years, showing the occurrence of marked differences in local moisture content in each of these phases.'

Abstract: 'A combined GCM analogue model and GCM land surface representation is used to investigate the influences of climatology and land surface parameterisation on modelled Amazonian vegetation change.

Advantage is taken of IMOGEN\xe2\x80\x99s computational speed which allows multiple simulations to be carried out to assess the robustness of the GCM results.'

Abstract: 'The global rate of fossil fuel combustion continues to rise, but the amount of CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere has not increased accordingly. The causes for this discrepancy are widely debated. Particularly, the location and drivers for the interannual variability of atmospheric CO2 are highly uncertain. Here we examine links between global atmospheric CO2 growth rate (CGR) and the climate anomalies of biomes based on (1986\xe2\x80\x931995) global climate data of ten years and accompanying satellite data sets. Our results show that four biomes, the tropical rainforest, tropical savanna, C4 grassland and boreal forest, and their responses to climate anomalies, are the major climate-sensitive CO2 sinks/sources that control the CGR. The nature and magnitude by which these biomes respond to climate anomalies are generally not the same. However, one common influence did emerge from our analysis; the extremely high CGR observed for the one extreme El Ni\xc3\xb1o year was caused by the response of the tropical biomes (rainforest, savanna and C4 grassland) to temperature.'

Abstract: 'A dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) coupled with a land surface model (LSM) is generally initialized using a spin-up process to derive a physically-consistent initial condition. Spin-up forcing, which is the atmospheric forcing used to drive the coupled model to equilibrium solutions in the spin-up process, varies across earlier studies. In the present study, the impact of the spin-up forcing in the initialization stage on the fractional coverages (FCs) of plant functional type (PFT) in the subsequent simulation stage are assessed in seven classic climate regions by a modified Community Land Model\xe2\x80\x99s Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (CLM-DGVM). Results show that the impact of spin-up forcing is considerable in all regions except the tropical rainforest climate region (TR) and the wet temperate climate region (WM). In the tropical monsoon climate region (TM), the TR and TM transition region (TR-TM), the dry temperate climate region (DM), the highland climate region (H), and the boreal forest climate region (BF), where FCs are affected by climate non-negligibly, the discrepancies in initial FCs, which represent long-term cumulative response of vegetation to different climate anomalies, are large. Moreover, the large discrepancies in initial FCs usually decay slowly because there are trees or shrubs in the five regions. The intrinsic growth timescales of FCs for tree PFTs and shrub PFTs are long, and the variation of FCs of tree PFTs or shrub PFTs can affect that of grass PFTs.'

Abstract: 'Although xylose is a major constituent of lignocellulosic feedstock and the second most abundant sugar in nature, only 22% of 3,152 screened bacterial isolates showed significant growth in xylose in 24\xc2\xa0h. Of those 684, only 24% accumulated polyhydroxyalkanoates after 72\xc2\xa0h. A mangrove isolate, identified as Bacillus sp. MA3.3, yielded the best results in literature thus far for Gram-positive strains in experiments with glucose and xylose as the sole carbon source. When glucose or xylose were supplied, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) contents of cell dry weight were, respectively, 62 and 64%, PHB yield 0.25 and 0.24\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 and PHB productivity (PPHB) 0.10 and 0.06\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0h\xe2\x88\x921. This 40% PPHB difference may be related to the theoretical ATP production per 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) monomer calculated as 3\xc2\xa0mol\xc2\xa0mol\xe2\x88\x921 for xylose, less than half of the ATP/3HB produced from glucose (7\xc2\xa0mol\xc2\xa0mol\xe2\x88\x921). In PHB production using sugar mixtures, all parameters were strongly reduced due to carbon catabolite repression. PHB production using Gram-positive strains is particularly interesting for medical applications because these bacteria do not produce lipopolysaccharide endotoxins which can induce immunogenic reactions. Moreover, the combination of inexpensive substrates and products of more value may lead to the economical sustainability of industrial PHB production.'

Abstract: 'The Cerrado Biome is the second largest in Brazil covering roughly 2 million km2, with varying features throughout its area. The Biome is endangered but it is also source of animal species for rural, green urban and degraded rainforest areas. Ticks are among Cerrado species that establish at anthropogenic sites and although information about them is steadily increasing, several features are unknown. We herein report tick species, abundance and some ecological relationships within natural areas of the Cerrado at higher altitudes (800\xe2\x80\x931500\xc2\xa0m) within and around Serra da Canastra National Park, in Minas Gerais State Brazil. In total of 1196 ticks were collected in the environment along 10 campaigns held in 3 years (2007\xe2\x80\x932009). Amblyomma sculptum was the most numerous species followed by Amblyomma dubitatum and Amblyomma brasiliense. Distribution of these species was very uneven and an established population of A. brasiliense in the Cerrado is reported for the first time. Other tick species (Amblyomma ovale, Amblyomma nodosum, Amblyomma parvum, Ixodes schulzei and Haemaphysalis leporispalustris) were found in\xc2\xa0lesser numbers. Domestic animals displayed tick infestations of both rural and urban origin as well as from natural areas (Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, Rhipicephalus microplus, Dermacentor nitens, A. sculptum, A. ovale, Amblyomma tigrinum, Argas miniatus). Amblyomma sculptum had the widest domestic host spectrum among all tick species. DNA of only one Rickettsia species, R. bellii, was found in an A. dubitatum tick. Several biological and ecological features of ticks of the studied areas are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Savanna woody plant communities are widespread in Brazil, where this vegetation type can be divided into core-central and marginal areas within its range of distribution. The study of diversity patterns of plant communities can provide insights into the distribution, biogeography, and diversity of plant species in widespread biomes. The objectives of this study were to measure standard and phylogenetic indices of diversity in woody plant communities of the savanna vegetation of Brazil (Cerrado) throughout its extensive range. Based on a meta-analysis, the diversity indexes were compared using traditional statistical methods, a phylogenetic approach, and by mapping. Similar patterns were found for phylogenetic and traditional indexes of diversity in core and marginal areas, suggesting that both lower and higher diversity sites can occur within the Cerrado geographical area. The only difference was found in low diversity, disjunct savanna sites within the Amazon basin, which are isolated by the Amazon River from the more continuous central\xe2\x80\x93southern Cerrado area.'

Abstract: 'Primary tropical rainforests are generally considered to be relatively nitrogen (N) rich, with characteristically large hydrologic and gaseous losses of inorganic N. However, emerging evidence suggests that some tropical ecosystems can exhibit tight N cycling, with low biologically available losses. In this study, we combined isotopic data with a well-characterized watershed N mass balance to close the N budget and characterize gaseous N losses at the ecosystem scale in a lowland tropical rainforest on the Osa Peninsula in southwestern Costa Rica. We measured \xce\xb415N and \xce\xb418O of nitrate (NO3 \xe2\x88\x92) in precipitation, surface, shallow and deep soil lysimeters and stream water biweekly for 1\xc2\xa0year. Enrichment of both isotopes indicates that denitrification occurs predominantly as NO3 \xe2\x88\x92 moves from surface soil down to 15\xc2\xa0cm depth or laterally to stream water, with little further processing in deeper soil. Two different isotopic modeling approaches suggested that the gaseous fraction comprises 14 or 32% of total N loss (2.7 or 7.5\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921), though estimates are sensitive to selection of isotopic fractionation values. Gas loss estimates using the mass balance approach (3.2\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921) fall within this range and include N2O losses of 0.9\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921. Overall, gaseous and soluble hydrologic N losses comprise a modest proportion (~\xc2\xa025%) of the total N inputs to this ecosystem. By contrast, relatively large, episodic hydrologic losses of non-biologically available particulate N balance the majority of N inputs and may contribute to maintaining conservative N cycling in this lowland tropical forest. Similar patterns of N cycling may occur in other tropical forests with similar state factor combinations\xe2\x80\x94high rainfall, steep topography, relatively fertile soils\xe2\x80\x94such as the western arc of the Amazon Basin and much of IndoMalaysia, but this hypothesis remains untested.'

Abstract: 'Wild animals have been a source of food and income through subsistence hunting by forest-dwelling people in Neotropical countries in spite of the fact that hunting appears to be unsustainable as it leads to the depletion of wild fauna. Laws in Brazil and other Latin American countries forbid hunting but allow the commercial use of captive-bred animals. Notwithstanding the fact that this is a controversial topic among conservationists, in this paper we propose that wildlife farming in the Neotropics can be an alternative to the over-hunting and deforestation that are carried out for the production of traditional food and pastures for livestock. This review sets out this proposal, and discusses the implications for tropical forest integrity and rural population dependency on forest resources. We discuss the ecological and economical advantages of wildlife farming and its constraints as a conservation tool, using collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) farming in the Amazon region as a model. Productivity levels may reach 19,000 times higher than those obtained from the management of peccaries from forests in the Amazon region. This can be achieved with an easily obtainable diet composed of forest fruits and locally available agricultural by-products. Therefore, establishing captive management programs for peccaries is an effective way of avoiding wild stock depletion, deforestation, and guaranteeing the livelihood of forest dwellers in the Neotropics. However, it is essential that governmental and/or non-governmental agencies be involved in providing subsides to establish peccary farms, provide technical assistance, and introducing peccary captive breeding centers to supply founder stock.'

Abstract: "Activities in Brazil's forest sector have substantial potential for mitigating global warming as well as additional environmental and other benefits. Silvicultural plantations of different types, reduced impact logging, and deforestation avoidance all have potential mitigation roles. The magnitude of the annual emission from recent rates of deforestation in Amazonia presents an opportunity for carbon (C) benefits through reducing current rates of deforestation. Measures related to Amazonian deforestation have greater potential carbon benefits than do options such as plantation silviculture, but much depends on how benefits are calculated. Procedures are needed for assessing the environmental and social impacts of Clean DevelopmentMechanism (CDM) projects."

Abstract: 'Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) infects all tissues of its hosts, which along with humans, include hundreds of mammalian species in the Americas. The epidemiology of T. cruzi has been changing in that currently the majority of the cases and/or outbreaks of Chagas disease occur by the ingestion of comestibles contaminated by T. cruzi metacyclic forms. These cases/outbreaks occur in distinct regional scenarios, mainly in the Amazon biome and are related to the local interaction mode of humans with their surroundings, as well as with the overall local ecological peculiarities. As trypanosomiasis caused by T. cruzi is primarily a zoonosis, understanding the variables that influences its transmission in the wild as well as the role played by the extant fauna in the maintenance of the parasite, is critical in establishing control measures. Here, we present the results of our studies of T. cruzi infection of free ranging wild mammalian fauna in the five biomes of Brazil, a country of continental dimensions. From 1992 up to 2017, we examined a total of 6587 free-ranging non-volant wild mammal specimens. Our studies found that 17% of mammals were seropositive and 8% of all animals displayed positive hemocultures indicative of high parasitemia and, consequently, of infectivity potential. We observed that opossums, mainly Philander spp. and Didelphis spp., the coati Nasua nasua, the capuchin monkey Sapajus libidinosus and the golden lion tamarin Leontopithecus rosalia, were mammal taxa that demonstrated higher rates of positive hemocultures. Additionally, Didelphis spp. demonstrated to be a competent bioaccumulator of TcI diversity. Chiroptera were distinguished for hosting the greatest diversity of species and genotypes of Trypanosoma spp. Additionally the observation of the higher host range of some Trypanosoma spp., shows the need to reassess the ecology of representatives of the taxon. Altogether, our results showed that each locality, may display distinct enzootiological and epidemiological scenarios that must be taken into account when it comes to establishing control and/or clarification campaigns of the local population.'

Abstract: 'Two sediment cores from the eastern coastal region of Maraj\xc3\xb3 Island, Par\xc3\xa1 State, northern Brazil have been studied by pollen analysis to reconstruct late Holocene mangrove dynamics and environmental changes. Seven AMS radiocarbon dates provide time control. Mangrove vegetation became established at the Barra Velha site at about 2750\xc2\xa0B.P. (2880\xc2\xa0cal B.P.) and at the Praia do Pesqueiro site at about 650\xc2\xa0B.P. (670\xc2\xa0cal B.P.). Rhizophora was the dominant mangrove tree throughout the recorded period, while Avicennia and Laguncularia were rare. Existing remnants of the former coastal Amazon rain forest were replaced by mangrove in the Barra Velha area between about 2750 and 740\xc2\xa0B.P. (2880\xe2\x80\x93760\xc2\xa0cal B.P.) and at Praia do Pesqueiro area between about 650 and 530\xc2\xa0B.P. (670\xe2\x80\x93540\xc2\xa0cal B.P.), suggesting a rise in relative sea level or, alternatively, an increase in discharge from the river Amazon. Areas of coastal shrub and herb vegetation, the so-called restinga vegetation, also became slightly reduced during the late Holocene. The largest area of mangrove at the two sites suggests that the highest sea level was probably reached during the last 200\xe2\x80\x93250 years. The only evidence of human activity at the two sites is an indication of cattle pastureland at the Barra Velha area during the last decades.'

Abstract: 'Three issues related to hunger, famine and food security are highlighted by the problems faced by \xe2\x80\x9cindigenous peoples\xe2\x80\x9d in many parts of the world. They affect not only the indigenous groups themselves, but also the potential for improved and increased food availability for the rest of humankind. First, indigenous peoples themselves continue to be subjected to the shock impact of outsiders in ways that remove their traditional access to land and other resources, especially those that provide customary sources of foods. The shock is therefore very negative in nutritional as well as the better-known cultural and health terms. Second, the destruction and disruption of many indigenous peoples is reducing the pool of knowledge (\xe2\x80\x9cethnoschience\xe2\x80\x9d) available concerning the biosphere and natural resources, which is of widespread value to humanity. Thirdly, this compounds the already well-known shock impact of the \xe2\x80\x9cinvaders\xe2\x80\x9d on those natural resources through environmental destruction and habitat alteration. These issues have a potential impact on global sustainability that is far greater than might be suggested by the small numbers of indigenous peoples involved. The paper argues for priority to be given to the links between hunger and food problems, the human rights of indigenous peoples, and environmental destruction.'

Abstract: 'Wildfires are an increasing threat to tropical rainforests, yet little is known about their effects on fruit production and forest wildlife. We examined the effects of both single and recurrent wildfires on fruit production and large vertebrate abundance in a central Amazonian terra firme forest for 3\xc2\xa0years following a large fire event. The estimated mortality of 42 and 74% of stems \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm in once- and twice-burnt forest led to a substantial loss of fruiting tree basal area (29 and 62% were lost in once- and twice-burnt forest, respectively) and crown coverage of fruiting woody lianas (89 and 97% were lost in once- and twice-burnt forest, respectively). Some important tree families producing fleshy fruits were less abundant than expected in once- and twice-burnt forest, suggesting that tree mortality was non-random in terms of species composition. Asynchronous fruit production was affected, and burnt forest transects sustained a much lower fruiting basal area, and fewer fruiting species during the dry season period of fruit scarcity. The number of fruiting trees in once- and twice-burnt forest was higher than the number predicted from actual levels of tree mortality recorded in each fire disturbance treatment, suggesting some surviving trees which may have benefited from higher irradiance levels and lower competition for resources. Many large frugivores and other vertebrate species declined in response to single fires, and most primary forest specialists were extirpated from twice-burnt forest, which sustained a higher number of species associated with second growth and other disturbed habitats.'

Abstract: 'We investigate the temporal evolution of moisture divergence and its spatial clustering properties over South America. Our analysis focuses on dependencies on the phase of the El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Moisture divergence is computed from daily reanalysis data of vertically integrated moisture flux provided by Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications for the time period from 1979 to 2010. We use a sliding-window approach to construct a sequence of complex networks, each obtained from synchronization of events of strong positive (negative) moisture divergence, which we interpret as strong evapotranspiration (precipitation) events. We make the following three key observations: (1) Moisture divergence values over the Amazon rainforest are typically higher during positive ENSO periods (El Ni\xc3\xb1o events). (2) The spatial coherence of strong positive (upwelling) events assumes a characteristic pattern of reduced coherence in this area during El Ni\xc3\xb1o conditions. This influence of ENSO on moisture divergence and its spatial coherence is dominated by the El Ni\xc3\xb1o events of 1982, 1987, and 1997. (3) The clustering characteristics of the obtained climate networks qualitatively agree with the spatial distribution of connected regions with simultaneous events (i.e., events that occur at the same time), but provide a more detailed view on the spatial organization of strong atmospheric upwelling events. Interestingly, no comparable results are found for negative extremes of moisture divergence (strong precipitation events).'

Abstract: 'We investigated the influences of forest or pasture land use and stream size on particulate and dissolved material concentrations in a network of second to third order streams in Rond\xc3\xb4nia, in the Brazilian Amazon. During the dry season, a second order stream originating in pasture had lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nitrate, higher concentrations of chlorophyll, total suspended solids, particulate organic carbon, particular organic nitrogen, ammonium, and phosphate than a second order stream originating in forest. Where the second order forest stream exited forest and entered pasture, concentrations of dissolved oxygen dropped from 6 mg/L to almost 0 mg/L and nitrate concentrations dropped from 12 \xce\xbcM to 2 \xce\xbcM over a reach of 2 km. These changes indicated a strong influence of land use. During the rainy season, differences among reaches of all particulate and dissolved materials were diminished. Concentrations of oxygen, chlorophyll, total suspended solids, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate in the third order pasture stream more closely resembled the second order forest stream than the second order pasture stream, suggesting that conditions in the channels of larger pasture streams more strongly control concentrations of these materials. If this pattern is widespread in stream networks of regions that consist of a mosaic of forest and pasture lands, it may have important consequences for understanding the effects of deforestation on larger rivers of the Amazon Basin. This would indicate that the effects of forest clearing on the concentrations of many suspended and dissolved materials will be most easily detected in very small streams but potentially difficult to detect in larger streams and rivers.'

Abstract: "Though strong concern over the rapid conversion of moist tropical forests may justifiably arise from any discipline, a growing interdisciplinary tide of voices is expressing its alarm over a particularly disturbing consequence of forest alteration and destruction: the reduction of species diversity through the extinction of numerous plant and animal species. Consequently, an array of ecologists land-use planners, botanists, zoologists and conservationsts are searching for means to enhance the protection and preservation of tropical forests' biotic diversity. Management schemes aimed at achieving this particular end are being investigated, particularly by UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) Project 8 of Biosphere Reserves Projects, by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) tropical forests conservation program (UNEP, 1980) and by the World Wildlife Fund. In addition, many countries with a significant area of moist tropical forest (MTF) are beginning to pursue some form of conservation strategy."

Abstract: 'Because palms grow in highly varying climates and reach considerable heights, they present a unique opportunity to evaluate how environment and plant size impact hydraulic function. We studied hydraulic properties of petioles from palms of varying height from three species: Iriartea deltoidea, a tropical rainforest species; Mauritia flexuosa, a tropical rainforest, swamp species; and Washingtonia robusta, a subtropical species. We measured leaf areas, petiole cross-sectional areas, specific conductivity (K S), petiole anatomical properties, vulnerability to embolism and leaf water potentials and calculated petiole Huber values and leaf-specific conductivities (K L). Leaf and petiole cross-sectional areas varied widely with height. However, hydraulic properties including Huber values, K S and K L, remained constant. The two palmate species, M. flexuosa and W. robusta, had larger Huber values than I. deltoidea, a pinnately-compound species which exhibited the highest K S. Metaxylem vessel diameters and vascular bundle densities varied with height in opposing patterns to maintain petiole conductivities. I. deltoidea and W. robusta petioles had similar P 50 values (the point at which 50% of hydraulic conductivity is lost) averaged over all crown heights, but W. robusta exhibited more negative P 50 values in taller palms. Comparison of P 50 values with transpiring midday leaf water potentials, as well as a double-dye staining experiment in a 1-m-tall palm, suggested that a fairly significant amount of embolisms were occurring and refilled on a diurnal basis. Therefore, across palms differing widely in height and growing environments, we found convergence in water transport per unit leaf area (K L) with individuals exhibiting differing strategies for achieving this.'

Abstract: 'In Part I, the authors succeeded in coupling the spectral atmospheric model (SAMIL_R42L9) developed at the State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (LASG/IAP/CAS) with the land surface model, Atmosphere-Vegetation-Interaction-Model (AVIM) and analyzed the climate basic state and land surface physical fluxes simulated by R42_AVIM. In this Part II, we further evaluate the simulated results of the biological processes, including leaf area index (LAI), biomass and net primary productivity (NPP) etc. Results indicate that R42_AVIM can simulate the global distribution of LAI and has good consistency with the monthly mean LAI provided by Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The simulated biomass corresponds reasonably to the vegetation classifications. In addition, the simulated annual mean NPP has a consistent distribution with the data provided by IGBP and MODIS, and compares well with the work in literature. This land-atmosphere coupled model will offer a new experiment tool for the research on the two-way interaction between climate and biosphere, and the global terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle.'

Abstract: 'Soil carbon stocks of 29 plots along a transect through tropical Brazil showed only minor soil carbon losses after land use shift, although replacement of forest-derived carbon was detectable in subsoil and topsoil, indicating that new equilibria in soil carbon stocks might not have been reached after deforestation. The proportion of carbon lost from soils was negligible as compared to the emissions from biomass reduction by deforestation itself. Industrial agriculture had the best ratio between food production and carbon loss, pointing toward a potential reduction of deforestation pressure by further agricultural intensification, which is not achieved in practice due to institutional obstacles and uneven benefit sharing. In contrast, farmers at the agricultural frontier were identified as change agents if alternative sustainable land uses, taking advantage of biodiversity-related ecosystem services, are fostered by better access to credit lines and extension management. Thus, constraining the climate change debate in agriculture to sole management of carbon stock changes in soil is misleading and draws the attention from the most urgent problems: deforestation caused by wrong incentives.'

Abstract: 'Changing atmospheric conditions often result in a data distribution shift in remote sensing images for different dates and locations making it difficult to discriminate between various classes of interest. To alleviate this data shift issue, we introduce a novel supervised classification framework, called Classify-Normalize-Classify (CNC). The proposed scheme uses a two classifier approach where the first classifier performs a rough segmentation of the class of interest (COI) in the input image. Then, the median signal of the estimated COI regions is subtracted from all image pixels values to normalize them. Finally, the second classifier is applied to the normalized image to produce the refined COI segmentation. The proposed methodology was tested to detect deforestation using bitemporal Landsat 8 OLI images over the Amazon rainforest. The CNC framework compared favorably to benchmark masks of the PRODES program and state-of-the-art classifiers run on surface reflectance images provided by USGS.'

Abstract: 'A number of floristic and vegetation studies apply the terms campo rupestre, campo de altitude (or Brazilian p\xc3\xa1ramo), and Tepui to neotropical azonal outcrop and montane vegetation. All of these are known to harbor considerable numbers of endemic plant species and to share several genera. In order to determine whether currently known combinations of vascular plant genera could help circumscribe and distinguish these vegetation types, we selected 25 floras which did not exclude herbs and compiled them into a single database. We then compared the S\xc3\xb8rensen similarities of the genus\xe2\x80\x93assemblages using the numbers of native species in the resulting 1945 genera by multivariate analysis. We found that the circumscription of campo rupestre and other Neotropical outcrop vegetation types may not rely exclusively on a combination of genera.'

Abstract: "To mitigate global climate change, a portfolio of strategies will be needed to keep the atmospheric CO2 concentration below a dangerous level. Here a carbon sequestration strategy is proposed in which certain dead or live trees are harvested via collection or selective cutting, then buried in trenches or stowed away in above-ground shelters. The largely anaerobic condition under a sufficiently thick layer of soil will prevent the decomposition of the buried wood. Because a large flux of CO2 is constantly being assimilated into the world's forests via photosynthesis, cutting off its return pathway to the atmosphere forms an effective carbon sink."

Abstract: 'The climates of the mid-Holocene (MH, 6,000\xc2\xa0years ago) and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000\xc2\xa0years ago) have been extensively documented and as such, have become targets for the evaluation of climate models for climate contexts very different from the present. In Part 1 of the present work, we have studied the MH and LGM simulations performed with the last two versions of the IPSL model: IPSL_CM4, run for the PMIP2/CMIP3 (Coupled Model Intercomparion Project) projects and IPSL_CM5A, run for the most recent PMIP3/CMIP5 projets. We have shown that not only are these models different in their simulations of the PI climate, but also in their simulations of the climatic anomalies for the MH and LGM. In the Part 2 of this paper, we first examine whether palaeo-data can help discriminate between the model performances. This is indeed the case for the African monsoon for the MH or for North America south of the Laurentide ice sheet, the South Atlantic or the southern Indian ocean for the LGM. For the LGM, off-line vegetation modelling appears to offer good opportunities to distinguish climate model results because glacial vegetation proves to be very sensitive to even small differences in LGM climate. For other cases such as the LGM North Atlantic or the LGM equatorial Pacific, the large uncertainty on the SST reconstructions, prevents model discrimination. We have examined the use of other proxy-data for model evaluation, which has become possible with the inclusion of the biogeochemistry morel PISCES in the IPSL_CM5A model. We show a broad agreement of the LGM\xe2\x80\x93PI export production changes with reconstructions. These changes are related to the mixed layer depth in most regions and to sea-ice variations in the high latitudes. We have also modelled foraminifer abundances with the FORAMCLIM model and shown that the changes in foraminifer abundance in the equatorial Pacific are mainly forced by changes in SSTs, hence confirming the SST-foraminifer abundance relationship. Yet, this is not the case in all regions in the North Atlantic, where food availability can have a strong impact of foraminifer abundances. Further work will be needed to exhaustively examine the role of factors other than climate in piloting changes in palaeo-indicators.'

Abstract: 'Low-carbon emissions are usually related to hydropower energy, making it an attractive option for nations with hydropower potential as it enables them to meet increasing electricity demand without relying on burning fossil fuels. In fact, the new wave of hydropower plant construction is occurring mainly in tropical areas where an additional environmental impact must be considered: biogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the degradation of biogenic carbon in reservoirs. Peru is planning to install up to 2000\xc2\xa0MW in hydropower until 2021, but the input and output flows, as well as the environmental impacts that these generate, have not been explored. Hence, a set of three hydropower plants built in the past decade located in the Peruvian Andes were analyzed from a life cycle perspective. The main objective of the study is to generate detailed life cycle inventories for each of these three hydropower plants with the aim of obtaining specific information for current conditions in Peru.'

Abstract: 'Relatively little is known about the dynamics of N in shifting cultivation and related cropping systems in the humid tropics of Latin America. The soils that predominate in 82% of the region, namely Oxisols and Ultisols, have a fairly high total N content. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the bulk of the N in tropical rainforests is present in the soil, and not in the biomass. Losses of N through clearing and burning are about 20\xe2\x80\x9325% of the N existing in the ecosystem. Mechanized land clearing causes larger N losses than the traditional slash and burn method. Ashes can contribute substantial amounts (67\xe2\x80\x93127 kg N ha\xe2\x88\x921) to the soil, which prevents N deficiency for the first crop sown, but N deficiency is observed from the second crop onwards. The rate of total-N decomposition in the arable layer is high during the first two years after burning, but subsequently reaches a new equilibrium with continuous cultivation.'

Abstract: 'Numerous studies have shown that intact tropical forests account for half of the total terrestrial sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Here, we analyzed and compared changes in three main tropical forest regions from 2000 to 2014, based on time-series analysis and landscape metrics derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer data. We examined spatial-pattern changes in percentage of tree cover and net primary production (NPP) for three tropical forest regions\xe2\x80\x94Amazon basin, Congo basin, and Southeast Asia. The results show that: the Amazon basin region had the largest tropical forest area and total NPP and a better continuity of TC distribution; the Southeast Asia region exhibited a sharp decrease in NPP and had comparatively separate spatial patterns of both TC and NPP; and the Congo basin region exhibited a dramatic increase in NPP and had better aggregation of forest NPP distribution. Results also show that aggregative patterns likely correlate with high NPP values.\n'

Abstract: 'Understanding and predicting vegetation patterns in floodplains are essential for conservation and/or restoration of river floodplains subject to hydrological alterations. We propose a conceptual hydroecological model to explain the disturbance mechanisms driving species diversity across large river floodplains. These ecosystems harbor a unique set of flood-tolerant species different from the surrounding upland vegetation. In elevation gradients across pristine floodplains, the greater the flooding, the fewer the number of plant species. As terrain elevation increases, flood depth and duration decrease and it is more likely that species composition is influenced by external natural or human-driven disturbances. The spatial interaction between the natural flood regime and upland factors creates patterns of disturbance gradients that influence how floodplain vegetation establishes. In regions where upland conditions are subject to strong external disturbances, species diversity peaks at intermediate stages along the disturbance gradient. We demonstrate this concept with observations from the Central Amazon and Pantanal in Brazil, the Mekong\xe2\x80\x99s Tonle Sap in Cambodia, and the Okavango Delta in Botswana. We discuss how this model could be further elaborated and validated to inform management of large river basins under the impact of upstream-induced flood pulse alterations.'

Abstract: 'Living trees constitute one of the major stocks of carbon in tropical forests. A better understanding of variations in the dynamics and structure of tropical forests is necessary for predicting the potential for these ecosystems to lose or store carbon, and for understanding how they recover from disturbance. Amazonian tropical forests occur over a vast area that encompasses differences in topography, climate, and geologic substrate. We observed large differences in forest structure, biomass, and tree growth rates in permanent plots situated in the eastern (near Santar\xc3\xa9m, Par\xc3\xa1), central (near Manaus, Amazonas) and southwestern (near Rio Branco, Acre) Amazon, which differed in dry season length, as well as other factors. Forests at the two sites experiencing longer dry seasons, near Rio Branco and Santar\xc3\xa9m, had lower stem frequencies (460 and 466\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 respectively), less biodiversity (Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener diversity index), and smaller aboveground C stocks (140.6 and 122.1\xc2\xa0Mg C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) than the Manaus site (626 trees\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, 180.1\xc2\xa0Mg C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921), which had less seasonal variation in rainfall. The forests experiencing longer dry seasons also stored a greater proportion of the total biomass in trees with >50\xc2\xa0cm diameter (41\xe2\x80\x9345 vs 30% in Manaus). Rates of annual addition of C to living trees calculated from monthly dendrometer band measurements were 1.9 (Manaus), 2.8 (Santar\xc3\xa9m), and 2.6 (Rio Branco) Mg C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. At all sites, trees in the 10\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0cm diameter class accounted for the highest proportion of annual growth (38, 55 and 56% in Manaus, Rio Branco and Santar\xc3\xa9m, respectively). Growth showed marked seasonality, with largest stem diameter increment in the wet season and smallest in the dry season, though this may be confounded by seasonal variation in wood water content. Year-to-year variations in C allocated to stem growth ranged from nearly zero in Rio Branco, to 0.8\xc2\xa0Mg C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in Manaus (40% of annual mean) and 0.9\xc2\xa0Mg C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 (33% of annual mean) in Santar\xc3\xa9m, though this variability showed no significant relation with precipitation among years. Initial estimates of the C balance of live wood including recruitment and mortality as well as growth suggests that live wood biomass is at near steady-state in Manaus, but accumulating at about 1.5\xc2\xa0Mg C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 at the other two sites. The causes of C imbalance in living wood pools in Santar\xc3\xa9m and Rio Branco sites are unknown, but may be related to previous disturbance at these sites. Based on size distribution and growth rate differences in the three sites, we predict that trees in the Manaus forest have greater mean age (~240\xc2\xa0years) than those of the other two forests (~140\xc2\xa0years).'

Abstract: 'The classical perspective that interspecific hybridization in animals is rare has been changing due to a growing list of empirical examples showing the occurrence of gene flow between closely related species. Using sequence data from cyt b mitochondrial gene and three intron nuclear genes (RPL9, c-myc, and RPL3) we investigated patterns of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence between two closely related toad species R. marina and R. schneideri. By comparing levels of differentiation at nuclear and mtDNA levels we were able to describe patterns of introgression and infer the history of hybridization between these species.'

Abstract: 'We inventoried 10\xc2\xa0ha of late-successional and seasonally inundated black-water floodplain (igap\xc3\xb3) forest along four river sections of the Negro River, Central Amazonia, Brazil. The aim of the study was to test if tree species composition and diversity changes along the river course, and whether these changes reflect the different geological formations of the Negro River. On a continental-wide scale, we assessed alpha-diversity patterns of black-water flooded forests across the Amazon and Orinoco basins. Phytosociological analyses include family and species importance, species similarity, and Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s alpha-diversity, as well as Detrended Correspondence Analysis. A total of 6.126 individuals were recorded, belonging to 243 tree species. Only few tree species occurred in more than one river section, and floristic composition changed abruptly from one section to the other. Tree species richness ranged from 57 to 79 species ha\xe2\x88\x921, and alpha-diversity was highest (27.24) in the lower river section upon sediments of Pliocene\xe2\x80\x93Pleistocene origin. We found a gradual decrease in species diversity with increasing age of the geological formations. The igap\xc3\xb3 forest is relatively species-poor, which we interpret to be the result of general low nutrient availability in alluvial substrates of the Negro River.'

Abstract: 'The long-term and continuous carbon fluxes of Changbaishan temperate mixed forest (CBS), Qianyanzhou subtropical evergreen coniferous forest (QYZ), Dinghushan subtropical evergreen mixed forest (DHS) and Xishuangbana tropical rainforest (XSBN) have been measured with eddy covariance techniques. In 2003, different responses of carbon exchange to the environment appeared across the four ecosystems. At CBS, the carbon exchange was mainly determined by radiation and temperature. 0\xc2\xb0C and 10\xc2\xb0C were two important temperature thresholds; the former determined the length of the growing season and the latter affected the magnitude of carbon exchange. The maximum net ecosystem exchange (N EE) of CBS occurred in early summer because maximum ecosystem photosynthesis (G PP) occurred earlier than maximum ecosystem respiration (R e). During summer, QYZ experienced severe drought and N EE decreased significantly mainly as a result of the depression of G PP. At DHS and XSBN, N EE was higher in the drought season than the wet season, especially the conversion between carbon sink and source occurring during the transition season at XSBN. During the wet season, increased fog and humid weather resulted from the plentiful rainfall, the ecosystem G PP was dispressed. The Q 10 and annual respiration of XSBN were the highest among the four ecosystems, while the average daily respiration of CBS during the growing season was the highest. Annual N EE of CBS, QYZ, DHS and XSBN were 181.5, 360.9, 536.2 and \xe2\x88\x92320.0 g\xc2\xb7C\xc2\xb7m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xb7a\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. From CBS to DHS, the temperature and precipitation increased with the decrease in latitude. The ratio of N EE/R e increased with latitude, while R e/G PP, ecosystem light use efficiency (L UE), precipitation use efficiency and average daily G PP decreased gradually. However, XSBN usually escaped such latitude trend probably because of the influence of the south-west monsoon climate which does not affect the other ecosystems. Long-term measurement and more research were necessary to understand the adaptation of forest ecosystems to climate change and to evaluate the ecosystem carbon balance due to the complexity of structure and function of forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'This paper overviews major international studies of the land/atmosphere interaction during the 1980s and previews those proposed for the 1990s. Selective results, either particular to individual studies or common to several, are interpreted to provide insight on the value and reliability of experimental data and field systems. This is used to provide guidance for future experiments. Progress in addressing the need to provide area-average, aggregate values for surface energy fluxes is assessed, and a recommendation made for enhanced attention to the use of planetary boundary development as an indirect measure of these.'

Abstract: 'Comparative measurements of radiation flux components and turbulent fluxes of energy and CO2 are made at two sites in South West Amazonia: one in a tropical forest reserve and one in a pasture. The data were collected from February 1999 to September 2002, as part of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). During the dry seasons, although precipitation and specific humidity are greatly reduced, the soil moisture storage profiles down to 3.4\xe2\x80\x89m indicate that the forest vegetation continues to withdraw water from deep layers in the soil. For this reason, seasonal changes observed in the energy partition and CO2 fluxes in the forest are small, compared to the large reductions in evaporation and photosynthesis observed in the pasture. For the radiation balance, the reflected short wave radiation increases by about 55% when changing from forest to pasture. Combined with an increase of 4.7% in long wave radiation loss, this causes an average reduction of 13.3% in net radiation in the pasture, compared to the forest. In the wet season, the evaporative fraction (\xce\xbbE/Rn) at the pasture is 17% lower than at the forest. This difference increases to 24% during the dry season. Daytime CO2 fluxes are 20\xe2\x80\x9328% lower (in absolute values) in the pasture compared to the forest. The night-time respiration in the pasture is also reduced compared to the forest, with averages 44% and 57% lower in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. As the reduction in the nocturnal respiration is larger than the reduction in the daytime uptake, the combined effect is a 19\xe2\x80\x9367% higher daily uptake of CO2 in the pasture, compared to the forest. This high uptake of CO2 in the pasture site is not surprising, since the growth of the vegetation is constantly renewed, as the cattle remove the biomass.'

Abstract: 'Acre State is located in the southwest of Amazonia (Brazil) and is internationally known for its fossiliferous sites which have yielded well-preserved fossils of major relevance to the understanding of the Cenozoic paleofauna of South America, mainly during the Miocene. In order to preserve this paleontological heritage and to study the material from the formations outcropping across south western Amazonia, the Paleontological Research Laboratory was created in the 1980s at the Federal University of Acre (acronym UFAC in Portuguese) and houses a collection including over 4500 catalogued specimens (mainly invertebrates, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals) and a small Museum open to the scientific community and to a wider society. This paper aims to identify the geoheritage value of the fossil record of Acre, which is represented by material collected from the Solim\xc3\xb5es Formation (Miocene to Pliocene) over the last three decades and stored at the UFAC. The qualitative evaluation system used, which integrates both its scientific and social uses, can also be applied to other Brazilian collections, in order to create a National Paleontological Database, similar to that already developed for Geological and Paleobiological Sites.'

Abstract: 'Environmental change during the Quaternary period has caused changes in the composition and structure of vegetation on the Sunda shelf of Southeast Asia. Climatic conditions drier than the present, particularly during the peak of the last ice age, led to a reduction in the extent of rain forests. Most recently, there has been a close association between drought and the occurrence of major, rain forest fires. Although many rain forest trees show adaptations to periodic drought, this is not the case for frequent or intense fires. Over evolutionary time-scales, major fires may thus have been largely confined to driver vegetation types, such as monsoon and deciduous forests, and only infrequently penetrated rain forest areas. Continental-scale distribution patterns for rain forest species reveal a number of biodiversity hotspots that are consistent for a broad range of taxonomically unrelated taxa. These biodiversity hotspots account for a relatively small part of the total extent of rain forest; they may also represent ecologically relatively stable areas. This paper discusses the location and extent of biodiversity hotspots on the Sunda shelf within the context of past and present environmental change. It finds that whatever the history of biodiversity hotspots, they are increasingly threatened by contemporary environmental change, notably a trend towards increasingly frequent and intense fires. The paper concludes that the trend is likely to continue, without major changes in those activities that degrade and precondition to fire remaining areas of rain forest.'

Abstract: 'This paper synthesizes what is known about the physical and biophysical impacts of climate change and their consequences for societies and development under different levels of global warming in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Projections show increasing mean temperatures by up to 4.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C compared to pre-industrial by the end of this century across LAC. Associated physical impacts include altered precipitation regimes, a strong increase in heat extremes, higher risks of droughts and increasing aridity. Moreover, the mean intensity of tropical cyclones, as well as the frequency of the most intense storms, is projected to increase while sea levels are expected to rise by ~0.2\xe2\x80\x931.1\xc2\xa0mm depending on warming level and region. Tropical glacier volume is found to decrease substantially, with almost complete deglaciation under high warming levels. The much larger glaciers in the southern Andes are less sensitive to warming and shrink on slower timescales. Runoff is projected to be reduced in Central America, the southern Amazon basin and southernmost South America, while river discharge may increase in the western Amazon basin and in the Andes in the wet season. However, in many regions, there is uncertainty in the direction of these changes as a result of uncertain precipitation projections and differences in hydrological models. Climate change will also reduce agricultural yields, livestock and fisheries, although there may be opportunities such as increasing rice yield in several LAC countries or higher fish catch potential in the southernmost South American waters. Species range shifts threaten terrestrial biodiversity, and there is a substantial risk of Amazon rainforest degradation with continuing warming. Coral reefs are at increasing risk of annual bleaching events from 2040 to 2050 onwards irrespective of the climate scenario. These physical and biophysical climate change impacts challenge human livelihoods through, e.g., decreasing income from fisheries, agriculture or tourism. Furthermore, there is evidence that human health, coastal infrastructures and energy systems are also negatively affected. This paper concludes that LAC will be severely affected by climate change, even under lower levels of warming, due to the potential for impacts to occur simultaneously and compound one another.'

Abstract: 'Resins of  Hymenaea, an angiosperm tree genus known to be a copious resin producer and a major source of amber since the Oligo-Miocene, were collected from a wide range of tropical environments from Latin America and Africa, and analyzed for their carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen stable isotope composition. The average value for \xce\xb413C in the resins was found to be \xe2\x88\x9227.0\xc2\xb11.3\xe2\x80\xb0, which is very similar to the values reported for resins in other studies. \xce\xb418\xce\x9f values for the Hymenaea resins averaged +11.2\xc2\xb11.6\xe2\x80\xb0, or about 20\xe2\x80\xb0 more depleted than normal plant cellulose. \xce\xb4D values of the resins ranged from \xe2\x88\x92196 to \xe2\x88\x92319\xe2\x80\xb0, with an average of \xe2\x88\x92243\xc2\xb130\xe2\x80\xb0. Rough estimates suggest a fractionation of \xe2\x88\x92200 to \xe2\x88\x92210\xe2\x80\xb0 between the resins and the environmental water. This value is similar to the \xe2\x88\x92200\xe2\x80\xb0 value observed for the fractionation between other plant lipids and environmental water. The present study suggests that the stable isotope composition of fossil resins (amber) has the potential to provide information on ancient environmental waters.'

Abstract: 'The study investigates the seasonal and element patterns of litterfall at two particular sites of \xe2\x80\x9cterra firme\xe2\x80\x9d forest in the central Amazon. The input of elements such as C, N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, na, Zn, Fe, Al, Mn, B and Cu was thoroughly evaluated in terms of site variability, mass flow of organic compounds of various litter compartments and elemental return flow. The results were compared with recent studies on literfall in the humid tropics.'

Abstract: 'We assess the spatial structure of moisture flux divergence, regional moisture sources and transport processes over Colombia, in northern South America. Using three independent methods the dynamic recycling model (DRM), FLEXPART and the Quasi-isentropic back-trajectory (QIBT) models we quantify the moisture sources that contribute to precipitation over the region. We find that moisture from the Atlantic Ocean and terrestrial recycling are the most important sources of moisture for Colombia, highlighting the importance of the Orinoco and Amazon basins as regional providers of atmospheric moisture. The results show the influence of long-range cross-equatorial flow from the Atlantic Ocean into the target region and the role of the study area as a passage of moisture into South America. We also describe the seasonal moisture transport mechanisms of the well-known low-level westerly and Caribbean jets that originate in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, respectively. We find that these dynamical systems play an important role in the convergence of moisture over western Colombia.'

Abstract: 'This paper assesses the uncertainties involved in the projections of seasonal temperature and precipitation changes over South America in the twenty-first century. Climate simulations generated by 24 general circulation models are weighted according to the reliability ensemble averaging (REA) approach. The results show that the REA mean temperature change is slightly smaller over South America compared to the simple ensemble mean. Higher reliability in the temperature projections is found over the La Plata basin, and a larger uncertainty range is located in the Amazon. A temperature increase exceeding 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C is found to have a very likely (>90\xc2\xa0%) probability of occurrence for the entire South American continent in all seasons, and a more likely than not (>50\xc2\xa0%) probability of exceeding 4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C by the end of this century is found over northwest South America, the Amazon Basin, and Northeast Brazil. For precipitation, the projected changes have the same magnitude as the uncertainty range and are comparable to natural variability.'

Abstract: 'The Paris Agreement on climate change recognises the central role of forests in achieving the well-below 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C goal through mitigation options covered by the REDD+ mechanism. Moreover, the actions that a country intends to take to address climate change under the new treaty are translated through the implementation of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). In this context, Brazil included REDD+ in its NDC submitted to the UNFCCC. Here, an overview of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s NDC is provided; focusing on its relation to the forest scope. Likewise, a discussion on the implications for the REDD+ governance framework in supporting the NDC compliance process is presented. Ultimately, it is argued that the goals announced in the country\xe2\x80\x99s NDC can be considered unpretentious, and a paradox to the conservation approach. Brazil is not keeping up the momentum of accepting the importance of the driving role of forests along with other sectors for the accomplishment of its NDC. For instance, this can be clearly noticed by the flexibilisation of the forest national legislation adopted in 2012. On the other hand, the country has the potential to contribute more than the announced targets in the attempt to limit expected global warming. However, even to achieve the current established targets, the government must better engage in public policies to leverage and change the country\xe2\x80\x99s course of development, which is still characterised by the dichotomy \xe2\x80\x98development versus environmental conservation\xe2\x80\x99.'

Abstract: 'Understory fire modeling is a key tool to investigate the cornerstone concept of landscape ecology, i.e. how ecological processes relate to landscape structure and dynamics. Within this context, we developed FISC\xe2\x80\x94a model that simulates fire ignition and spread and its effects on the forest carbon balance. FISC is dynamically coupled to a land-use change model to simulate fire regimes on the Amazonian landscapes of the Xingu Headwaters under deforestation, climate change, and land-use management scenarios. FISC incorporates a stochastic cellular automata approach to simulate fire spread across agricultural and forested lands. CARLUC, nested in FISC, simulates fuel dynamics, forest regrowth, and carbon emissions. Simulations of fire regimes under modeled scenarios revealed that the major current and future driver of understory fires is forest fragmentation rather than climate change. Fire intensity proved closely related to the landscape structure of the remaining forest. While climate change may increase the percentage of forest burned outside protected areas by 30% over the next four decades, deforestation alone may double it. Nevertheless, a scenario of forest recovery and better land-use management would abate fire intensity by 18% even in the face of climate change. Over this time period, the total carbon balance of the Xingu\xe2\x80\x99s forests varies from an average net sink of 1.6\xc2\xa0ton\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in the absence of climate change, fire and deforestation to a source of \xe2\x88\x920.1\xc2\xa0ton\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in a scenario that incorporates these three processes.'

Abstract: ' Pseudoplatystoma species are highly prized South American Pimelodid migratory catfishes. Until recently, their taxonomy was not clearly established, with discrepancies between morphological and molecular analyses. Here, Pseudoplatystoma species from the Peruvian Amazon were characterized at the molecular level from a sample representing the observed range of their color pattern variations in the study area. Analyses were performed using seven microsatellite loci for 103 specimens and, for part of them (52), using sequences of two regions of their mitochondrial genome [Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and Control Region (CR)]. Factorial correspondence analysis and assignment tests based on microsatellite polymorphism showed that the specimens originally identified as P. punctifer belonged to two different gene pools highly differentiated from P. tigrinum. Morphological examination identified two different morphotypes (with and without black stripes), suggesting the existence of two distinct taxa within P. punctifer. This result was corroborated by the ML tree based on CR sequences, where all individuals but four clustered in a similar way as in the FCA and Bayesian assignment tests. For these four individuals, mitochondrial introgression or retention of ancestral polymorphism was likely. In contrast, the ML tree based on COI sequences showed that reciprocal monophyly was not yet achieved for this marker for the two P. punctifer taxa. The existence of three sympatric species of Pseudoplatystoma in the Peruvian Amazon is discussed in relation to their molecular characteristics, color patterns and ecology. Evolutionary scenarios regarding their divergence are hypothesized.\n'

Abstract: 'The transformation of forest into pastures in the Brazilian Amazon leads to significant consequences to climate at local scale. In the region of Alta Floresta (Mato Grosso, Brazil), deforestation has been intense with over half the forests being cut since 1970. This article first examines the evolution of precipitation observed in this region and shows a significant trend in the decrease in total precipitation especially at the end of the dry season and at the beginning of the rainy season. The study then compares the temperatures measured in cleared and forested sectors within a reserve in the area of Alta Floresta (Mato Grosso, Brazil) between 2006 and 2007. The cleared sector was always hotter and drier (from 5% to 10%) than the forested area. This difference was not only especially marked during the day when it reached on average 2\xc2\xb0C but also seemed to increase during the night with the onset of the dry season (+0.5\xc2\xb0C). The Urban Heat Island effect is also evident especially during the night and in the dry season.'

Abstract: 'Chlorophyll a-concentrations, AFWD (ash-free-dry-weight) and photosynthesis rates were estimated for periphyton assemblages in Amazonian black-and white-water habitats over 14 months. Cellulose-acetate strips were incubated in situ and showed few major differences in periphyton quality as compared to natural substrata. The only exceptions were submersed Igap\xc3\xb3 forest leaves, which exhibited higher proportions of green algae and cyanobacteria though not producing differences in total periphyton biomass. Enclosure experiments showed a considerable nutrient release by inundated non-senescent Igap\xc3\xb3 forest leaves. Periphyton biomass and productivity were found to be highest in black-and white water mixing zones, where biomass peaked at 41.6 mg Chla/m2 and 19.8 g/m2 AFDW. Production was estimated to be 380 gC/m2\xc2\xb7a. Maximum biomass of periphyton in floating meadows was 46 mg Chla/m2 and 10.6 g/m2 AFDW, with an annual production of 170 gC/m2\xc2\xb7a. Solim\xc3\xb5es main channel periphyton values were low: maximum Chla was 7.1 mg/m2, AFDW 0.8 g/m2 and annual production was estimated to be 30 gC/m2. Blackwater periphyton values were lower compared to whitewater and mixed water values but an enlarged trophogenic zone has to be taken into account. Highest Chla content reached 30.9 mg/m2, AFDW 1.43 g/m2. Estimated annual production was 110 gC/m2. Observed mean periphyton productivity of Amazonian blackwater habitats approximately corresponded to mesotrophic attached algae productivity in temperate zones, whereas productivity of whitewater periphyton approached those of temperate eutrophic lakes. The role of periphyton in the Amazon food web is discussed.'

Abstract: "The division between rural and urban sectors of the landscape in many parts of the world is increasingly blurred. House-lot or homegardens offer a perspective on understanding rural-urban linkages since they are frequently a landscape feature in both settings and the exchanges of their products link the two. House-lot gardens are an under-researched component of the agricultural repertoires of smallholders in many parts of the world. Urban house-lot gardens in particular, have until recently not received much attention despite their critical importance to urban livelihoods. This paper presents findings from research on house-lot gardens in rural and urban zones of Santar\xc3\xa9m, Par\xc3\xa1, Brazil, one of Amazonia's largest municipalities. The research demonstrates that garden products are important for household subsistence, but even more importantly product exchanges between rural and urban kin households help sustain critical social networks that subsidize urban life. Gardens are a link between urban and rural settings as products, germplasm, and household members move between the two. People are urban and rural at the same time which demonstrates that households can be multi-local."

Abstract: 'Solanum hygrothermicumOchoa, a new potato species, is described. This species is cultivated by some native inhabitants of the warm humid lowlands of Peru, such as the Campasand Aguarunasin the central Amazon basin and Machigangasin southeastern Peru. Cultivation is limited only to some members of the tribes. The species belongs to series Tuberosaand has 2n = 4x= 48 chromosomes. It is the only potato cultivated under the climatic regime of the warm rainforest in the Peruvian Amazon basin, where it is native. Unfortunately, this rare potato is becoming extinct.'

Abstract: 'Determinants of the clinical presentation of the leishmaniases are poorly understood but Leishmania species and strain differences are important. To examine the relationship between clinical presentation, species and isoenzyme polymorphisms, 56 Leishmania isolates from distinct presentations of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) from Ecuador were analyzed.'

Abstract: 'It is generally assumed that declining soil fertility during cultivation forces farmers to clear forest. We wanted to test this for a rainforest margin area in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. We compared soil characteristics in different land-use systems and after different length of cultivation. 66 sites with four major land-use systems (maize, agroforestry, forest fallow and natural forest) were sampled. Soils were generally fertile, with high base cation saturation, high cation exchange capacity, moderate pH-values and moderate to high stocks of total nitrogen. Organic matter stocks were highest in natural forest, intermediate in forest fallow and lowest in maize and agroforestry sites. In maize fields soil organic matter decreased during continuous cultivation, whereas in agroforestry it was stable or had the tendency to increase in time. The effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) was highest in natural forest and lowest in maize fields. Base cations saturation of ECEC did not change significantly during cultivation both maize and agroforestry, whereas the contribution of K cations decreased in maize and showed no changes in agroforestry sites. Our results indicate that maize cultivation tends to reduce soil fertility but agroforestry systems are able to stop this decline of soil fertility or even improve it. As most areas in this rain forest margin are converted into agroforestry systems it is unlikely that soil degradation causes deforestation in this case. On the contrary, the relatively high soil fertility may actually attract new immigrants who contribute to deforestation and start agriculture as smallholders.'

Abstract: 'Tropical landscapes are not only rapidly transformed by ongoing land-use change, but are additionally confronted by increasing seasonal climate variation. There is an increasing demand for studies analyzing the effects and feedbacks on ecosystem functioning of large-scale conversions of tropical natural forest into intensively managed cash crop agriculture. We analyzed the seasonality of aboveground litterfall, fine root litter production, and aboveground woody biomass production (ANPPwoody) in natural lowland forests, rubber agroforests under natural tree cover (\xe2\x80\x9cjungle rubber\xe2\x80\x9d), rubber and oil palm monocultures along a forest-to-agriculture transformation gradient in Sumatra. We hypothesized that the temporal fluctuation of litter production increases with increasing land-use intensity, while the associated nutrient fluxes and nutrient use efficiency (NUE) decrease. Indeed, the seasonal variation of aboveground litter production and ANPPwoody increased from the natural forest to the plantations, while aboveground litterfall generally decreased. Nutrient return through aboveground litter was mostly highest in the natural forest; however, it was significantly lower only in rubber plantations. NUE of N, P and K was lowest in the oil palm plantations, with natural forest and the rubber systems showing comparably high values. Root litter production was generally lower than leaf litter production in all systems, while the root-to-leaf ratio of litter C flux increased along the land-use intensity gradient. Our results suggest that nutrient and C cycles are more directly affected by climate seasonality in species-poor agricultural systems than in species-rich forests, and therefore might be more susceptible to inter-annual climate fluctuation and climate change.'

Abstract: 'Fourteen species of bats are reported for the first time from Guyana (Saccopteryx gymnura, Micronycteris brachyotis, M. homezi, Lichonycteris obscura, Anoura latidens, Vampyressa pusilla, Vampyrodes caraccioli, Eptesicus chiriquinus, Cynomops paranus, Molossops neglectus, Molossus sp., Molossus coibensis, Molossus sinaloae, and Promops centralis) bringing the known bat diversity for the country to 121 species. Information including measurements, reproductive data, distribution, and taxonomy are provided for these species. Seven of these new records were collected in the Iwokrama International Rain Forest Programme site in central Guyana. Eighty-six bat species are now documented from Iwokrama Forest which is the highest species diversity for bats reported from any protected area in the world. There are, however, few tropical sites that have relatively complete inventories. A summary for bat species diversity in southern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana indicates that at least 146 species of bats are known from the Guianan subregion. Intense inventory surveys, especially in the often neglected subcanopy, suggest that species richness is probably underestimated in most Neotropical areas. Likewise, species-level diversity in the Guianan subregion is higher than previously suggested. Surveying and monitoring biodiversity are critical to developing a National Protected Areas System in Guyana.'

Abstract: 'The extent of the Amazon rainforest is projected to drastically decrease in future decades because of land-use changes. Previous climate modelling studies have found that the biogeophysical effects of future Amazonian deforestation will likely increase surface temperatures and reduce precipitation locally. However, the magnitude of these changes and the potential existence of tipping points in the underlying relationships is still highly uncertain. Using a regional climate model at a resolution of about 50\xc2\xa0km over the South American continent, we perform four ERA-interim-driven simulations with prescribed land cover maps corresponding to present-day vegetation, two deforestation scenarios for the twenty-first century, and a totally-deforested Amazon case. In response to projected land cover changes for 2100, we find an annual mean surface temperature increase of \\(0.5\\,^{\\circ }\\hbox {C}\\) over the Amazonian region and an annual mean decrease in rainfall of 0.17\xc2\xa0mm/day compared to present-day conditions. These estimates reach \\(0.8\\,^{\\circ }\\hbox {C}\\) and 0.22\xc2\xa0mm/day in the total-deforestation case. We also compare our results to those from 28 previous (regional and global) climate\xc2\xa0modelling experiments. We show that the historical development of climate models did not modify the median estimate of the Amazonian climate sensitivity to deforestation, but led to a reduction of its uncertainty. Our results suggest that the biogeophysical effects of deforestation alone are unlikely to lead to a tipping point in the evolution of the regional climate under present-day climate conditions. However, the conducted synthesis of the literature reveals that this behaviour may be model-dependent, and the greenhouse gas-induced climate forcing and biogeochemical feedbacks should also be taken into account to fully assess the future climate of this region.'

Abstract: 'Initial results of a pilot study to link remotely-sensed information on tropical forest loss to field-based information on species endangerment are reported here. LANDSAT multispectral scanner (MSS) imagery from 1973 and 1988 were used to estimate net forest removal (29% of forest area), regrowth (7% of forest area, including possible artifactual errors), and forest edges in Mabira Forest in southeastern Uganda during the 15-year period. Of the forest remaining, the percentage that was heavily disturbed increased from 18% to 42%. This change in forest density was observable with the MSS imagery. The total forest edge-to-area ratio (including edges interior to the forest boundary) increased by 29% over the period. Although four distinct types of closed tropical forest, based on structure or dominance, could be recognized on the ground, the types could not be distinguished by differences in spectral reflectance in the four MSS bands. Closed tropical forest could be readily distinguished from exotic conifer plantations, banana plantations, and other non-forest vegetation types. Field measurements in Mabira and other Ugandan rain forests, and in rain forest isolates on the Atherton Tableland of North Queensland, are being made to relate changes in forest fragmentation to resulting changes in species abundance, structural form of the forests, and morphological diversity of target populations. Possible applications of conservation biology theory and modeling to these data are briefly discussed.'

Abstract: 'We review resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbance of palm populations and communities in tropical America. Response of palms to disturbance depends on their morphological traits, their reproductive strategies and the impacts of these traits and strategies on phenology and gene flow. Human impact induces changes in genetic structure, increasing endogamy and genetic drift in fragmented populations. Forest fragmentation and harvest of palm organs are well documented whereas effects of intermediate disturbance like selective logging, hunting or fire remain poorly known. We recommend emphasis on long-term experiments and on the use of mechanistic approaches in future research to facilitate integration of available data into a theoretical ecological framework.'

Abstract: 'Anopheles darlingi is one of the most important malaria vectors in the Americas. In this era of new tools and strategies for malaria and vector control it is essential to have knowledge on the ecology and behavior of vectors in order to evaluate appropriateness and impact of control measures. This paper aims to provide information on the importance, ecology and behavior of An. darlingi. It reviews publications that addressed ecological and behavioral aspects that are important to understand the role and importance of An. darlingi in the transmission of malaria throughout its area of distribution. The results show that Anopheles darlingi is especially important for malaria transmission in the Amazon region. Although numerous studies exist, many aspects determining the vectorial capacity of An. darlingi, i.e. its relation to seasons and environmental conditions, its gonotrophic cycle and longevity, and its feeding behavior and biting preferences, are still unknown. The vector shows a high degree of variability in behavioral traits. This makes it difficult to predict the impact of ongoing changes in the environment on the mosquito populations. Recent studies indicate a good ability of An. darlingi to adapt to environments modified by human development. This allows the vector to establish populations in areas where it previously did not exist or had been controlled to date. The behavioral variability of the vector, its adaptability, and our limited knowledge of these impede the establishment of effective control strategies. Increasing our knowledge of An. darlingi is necessary.'

Abstract: 'Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is a potential source of ecological information. Typically TEK has been documented at the species level, but habitat data would be equally valuable for conservation applications. We compared the TEK forest type classification of ribere\xc3\xb1os, the non-indigenous rural peasantry of Peruvian Amazonia, to a floristic classification produced using systematically collected botanical data. Indicator species analysis of pteridophytes in 300 plots detected two forest types on non-flooded tierra firme, each associated with distinct soil texture and fertility, and one forest type in areas subject to flooding. Nine TEK forest types were represented in the same set of plots. Each TEK forest type was consistently (>82%) associated with one of the three floristic classes and there were also clear parallels in the ecological characterizations of the forest types. Ribere\xc3\xb1os demonstrated clear preferences for certain forest types when selecting sites for slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting. Our results indicate that the non-tribal inhabitants of Amazonia possess valuable TEK that could be used in biodiversity inventories and wildlife management and conservation for characterizing primary rain forest habitats in Amazonia.'

Abstract: 'We developed an indicator that defines priority municipalities in order to facilitate the deployment of preventive policies and strategies for ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change (EbA) in Brazilian municipalities. Based on the premises that poor people are the population most vulnerable to climate change and that conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems are adaptive to climate change, our indicator uses three parameters: (1) poverty, (2) proportion of natural-vegetation cover, and (3) exposure to climate change. Thus, we searched for Brazilian municipalities that simultaneously belonged to the quartile of municipalities with the highest percentage of poverty, the quartile with the highest percentage of natural-vegetation cover, and the quartile with the highest exposure indices in two global climate models (Eta-HadGEM, Eta-Miroc). We found 398 (7.1%) EbA hotspots among 5565 Brazilian municipalities, which comprise 36% of the total area of native remnants in the country and are home to 22% of the poor people in Brazil. In their majority, these municipalities cover significant portions of the Amazon, Cerrado, Caatinga, and Atlantic forest, and indeed, these regions are recognised as some of the most vulnerable to climate change in the world. Considering the relevance of these biomes for the global water and nutrient cycle (Amazon), global food security (Cerrado), vulnerability to desertification (Caatinga), and biodiversity (all) we discuss the adaptive strategies in place, the need to bring them to scale, and existing policy gaps. Finally, in an effort to guide international and national investment and policies, we discuss how the approach described here can be applied to societies inhabiting tropical forests, savannas, and semiarid zones in other parts of the world. In particular, we propose that the indicator developed here is a simple and fast way to achieve early detection of priority municipalities for deployment of EbA action and policies, particularly in tropical developing countries.'

Abstract: 'The southern border of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the most sensitive areas to deforestation in Brazil. Pondering problems related to changes in land use, new issues are emerging, such as, climate change and its negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. The higher frequency of El Ni\xc3\xb1o and La Ni\xc3\xb1a seems to have strong influence on rainfall in Amazonia. They are becoming more lasting and intense in the course of the last 20 to 30\xc2\xa0years compared to the past 100\xc2\xa0years. This paper may confront the scientific knowledge of the relations of climate and water resources in Amazon with the points of vulnerability that anthropic societies present in the region. The impact of climate change is not uniformly borne by different regions and populations. Actually, individuals, sectors and systems are affected to varying degrees and, besides, they may be prejudiced to a greater or lesser extent. These impacts vary in magnitude and intensity in accordance with certain aspects, for instance, geographical location, time, the prevalent social, economic and environmental conditions and the infra-structure of a given location. A comprehensive description of these extreme climate events is one of the first steps to a regional vulnerability approach.'

Abstract: 'Historic carbon emissions are an important foundation for proposed efforts to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks through conservation and sustainable forest management (REDD+). The level of uncertainty in historic carbon emissions estimates is also critical for REDD+, since high uncertainties could limit climate benefits from credited mitigation actions. Here, we analyzed source data uncertainties based on the range of available deforestation, forest degradation, and forest carbon stock estimates for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 1990-2008.'

Abstract: 'Resurgent protectionists advocate a return to strict nature protection characterized by excluding most people from ecologically fragile areas. Certain groups of indigenous residents, namely those with low population densities, simple technologies, and subsistence economies, are seen as conservation friendly, but groups who are experiencing demographic growth, using Western technologies, and producing for the market are perceived as incompatible with biodiversity conservation. Using insights from common property theory as well as ethnographic observations of the Huaorani Indians of Ecuador, I illustrate how such assumptions constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cconservation Catch-22\xe2\x80\x9d in which cultural conditions deemed compatible with biodiversity conservation are precisely those from which we would not predict conservationist practices to emerge. Romanticized conditions deemed harmonious with nature lack the incentives necessary for people to develop conservationist practices. Conservation is not a state of being, but a social process inextricably linked to social and political institutions influencing resource management.'

Abstract: 'Our objective was to asses site parameters, species diversity, phytomass structure and element stores of a Terra-firme forest prior to subsequent studies on nutrient fluxes during forest conversion. The soil was classified as a Xanthic Ferralsol, with a low effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), low nutrient status and a deeply weathered solum. On 0.75\xc2\xa0ha, including all trees with a DBH >7\xc2\xa0cm, we identified 222 tree species belonging to 58 families. The above-ground phytomass was estimated using logarithmic regression analysis on two plots of 0.25\xc2\xa0ha each. Despite differences in forest structure and species composition, no major differences were found in terms of total phytomass or overall element stores. The mean living above-ground phytomass (LAGP) was 257\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, and mean quantity of litter 14\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, while dead wood contributed between 10 to 17% of total above-ground phytomass (32\xe2\x80\x9356\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). Element store in LAGP was medium to high compared to other studies on tropical forest systems, while LAGP itself was comparatively low. Comparing 26 humid tropical forest stands recorded in literature, no correlation was found between LAGP and the amount of N and base cations stored in LAGP. However, a correlation between LAGP and P storage in LAGP (R2=0.76) indicates the important role P may play in phytomass accumulation on zonal tropical soils. More then 60% of C, 20% of total N, 10% of total P and 66\xe2\x80\x9388% of total K, Ca and Mg of the system (including the first meter of soil) were concentrated in the above-ground phytomass, including deadwood and litter. Consequently, phytomass destruction in form of forest conversion will lead to major element losses from the system.'

Abstract: 'In the central Amazon basin, the effects of secondary vegetation and primary forest on inorganic and organic P and S pools were compared with those of different fruit and timber tree species in a multistrata agroforestry system. The soils (Xanthic Ferralsols) were low in readily available P and S. Fertilizer applications increased the less accessible nutrient pools more than the plant available pools. For example, dilute-acid extractable P increased substantially (from 2 to 76 mg P kg\xe2\x88\x921), whereas Mehlich P (plant available) increased less (from 3 to 19 mg P kg\xe2\x88\x921). In contrast, the recalcitrant soil P pools, such as the residual P, did not increase on the short term, but only after more than six years following application. The proportion of less available ester-sulfate S was significantly higher in fertilized sites than in unfertilized sites, in contrast to soluble inorganic sulfate S or carbon-bonded S. The marked increase of successively available soil P and S pools through fertilization was advantageous with respect to the long-term effect of nutrient applications. Soil nutrient availability was not only related to the amount of nutrients applied but was also influenced by tree species. Nutrient return by litterfall and litter quality played an important role in soil P and S dynamics. Incorporation of applied nutrients into successively available organic nutrient pools will decrease potential P fixation and S losses by leaching and increase long-term nutrient availability. Therefore, tree species with rapid above-ground nutrient cycling and high quality litter (such as annato [Bixa orellana] and peach palm [Bactris gasipaes]) should constitute the majority of crops in multistrata agroforestry systems on infertile soils to ensure adequate medium to long term availability of P and S.'

Abstract: 'As an active microwave remote sensing imaging sensor, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays an important role in earth observation. Here we establish a SAR system based on the platform of the moon. This will aid large-scale, constant, and long-term dynamic Earth observations to better meet the needs of global change research and to complement the space borne and airborne earth observations. Lunar-based SAR systems have the characteristics of high resolution and wide swath width. The swath width could be thousands of kilometers in the stripe mode and it could cover 40% of earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface with 10 meters or even higher spatial resolution in the scanning mode. Using the simplified observation model, here we quantitatively analyze the spatial resolution and coverage area of lunar-based SAR and simulate the observation on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and the Amazon plain. The results show that this system could provide near 100% daily coverage of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, whereas 40% to 70% daily coverage of the Amazon plain. Lunar-based SAR could provide large-scale, long-term and stable time series data in order to support future research of global change.'

The objectives of this study are to (i) develop a general framework to characterise diverse stakeholder perspectives on REDD+ programme objectives and governance arrangements, and (ii) apply this framework to analyse key stakeholders involved in REDD+ readiness process of Peru: the Inter-ethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest (Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Inter\xc3\xa9tnica de Desarrollo de la Selva Peruana, AIDESEP), the Peruvian government and the World Bank. As indigenous peoples strive to maintain their own traditions and priorities, a turbulent readiness process is helping to resolve long-ignored issues of indigenous rights and to make REDD+ programme governance structures more inclusive. The Peruvian government/World Bank approach to REDD+ is incompatible with that of AIDESEP, therefore parallel implementation will be required for them to co-exist. Although a diversity of participants has helped to check and balance the centralization of decision-making power over REDD+ programme development, a history of failed assurances and agreements point to a need to maintain vigilance as new laws, regulations and safeguards are implemented.'

Abstract: 'Organic and inorganic carbon (C) fluxes transported by water were evaluated for dominant hydrologic flowpaths on two adjacent headwater catchments in the Brazilian Amazon with distinct soils and hydrologic responses from September 2003 through April 2005. The Ultisol-dominated catchment produced 30% greater volume of storm-related quickflow (overland flow and shallow subsurface flow) compared to the Oxisol-dominated catchment. Quickflow fluxes were equivalent to 3.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2% of event precipitation for the Ultisol catchment, compared to 2.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.3% for the Oxisol-dominated watershed (mean response \xc2\xb11 SE, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa027 storms for each watershed). Hydrologic responses were also faster on the Ultisol watershed, with time to peak flow occurring 10\xc2\xa0min earlier on average as compared to the runoff response on the Oxisol watershed. These different hydrologic responses are attributed primarily to large differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity (K s). Overland flow was found to be an important feature on both watersheds. This was evidenced by the response rates of overland flow detectors (OFDs) during the rainy season, with overland flow intercepted by 54\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.5% and 65\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.5% of OFDs for the Oxisol and Ultisol watersheds respectively during biweekly periods. Small volumes of quickflow correspond to large fluxes of dissolved organic C (DOC); DOC concentrations of the hydrologic flowpaths that comprise quickflow are an order of magnitude higher than groundwater flowpaths fueling base flow (19.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.7\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 DOC for overland flow and 8.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.7\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 DOC for shallow subsurface flow versus 0.50\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.04,mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 DOC in emergent groundwater). Concentrations of dissolved inorganic C (DIC, as dissolved CO2\xe2\x80\x93C plus HCO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x80\x93C) in groundwater were found to be an order of magnitude greater than quickflow DIC concentrations (21.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 DIC in emergent groundwater versus 1.1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 DIC in overland flow). The importance of deeper flowpaths in the transport of inorganic C to streams is indicated by the 40:1 ratio of DIC:DOC for emergent groundwater. Dissolved CO2\xe2\x80\x93C represented 92% of DIC in emergent groundwater. Results from this study illustrate a highly dynamic and tightly coupled linkage between the C cycle and the hydrologic cycle for both Ultisol and Oxisol landscapes: organic C fluxes strongly tied to flowpaths associated with quickflow, and inorganic C (particularly dissolved CO2) transported via deeper flowpaths.'

Abstract: 'The intricacies of one of the most relevant agribusiness frontiers in the world today\xe2\x80\x94the north of the State of Mato Grosso, in the southern section of the Amazon, Brazil\xe2\x80\x94are considered through a critical examination of place-making. Vast areas of Amazon rainforest and savannah vegetation were converted there, since the 1970s, into places of intensive soybean farming, basically to fulfil exogenous demands for land and agriculture production. The present assessment goes beyond the configuration of new places at the agricultural frontier, and starts with a qualitative intellectual jump: from place-making on the frontier to place-making as an ontological frontier in itself. It means that, instead of merely studying the frontier as a constellation of interconnected places, we examine the politicised genesis of the emerging places and their trajectory under fierce socio-ecological disputes. The consideration of almost five decades of intense historic-geographical change reveals an intriguing dialectics of displacement (of previous socio-ecological systems, particularly affecting squatters and indigenous groups, in order to create opportunities for migrants and companies), replacement (of the majority of disadvantaged farmers and poor migrants, leading to land concentration, widespread financialisation and the decisive influence of transnational corporations) and misplacement (which is the synthesis of displacement and replacement, demonstrated by mounting risks and a pervasive sentiment of maelstrom). Overall, there was nothing inevitable in the process of rural and regional development, but the problems, conflicts and injustices that characterise its turbulent geographical trajectory were all more or less visible from the outset.'

Abstract: 'Understanding patterns of speciesl habitat use and their response to dramatic changes in habitat constitutes a basis for sound conservation practice. This study examined use of breeding habitat by two rainforest-breeding frog species near primary forest edge. Nine artificial breeding pools were established along each of three transects perpendicular to continuous primary forest near Manaus, Brazil. Five frog species bred in the pools over the six-month monitoring period. For the two most abundant species, patterns of habitat use were independent of proximity to forest edge. Also,Epipedobates femoralis used pools outside the forest, in secondary growth, at the same frequency as pools inside the forest.Osteocephalus taurinus did not breed outside primary forest. These results have clear implications for conservation biology: (i) buffer zones around isolated reserves, to counter possible negative edge effects on habitat, are unnecessary for these frog species, and (ii) secondary growth habitat, which is not \xe2\x80\x98natural\xe2\x80\x99 breeding habitat forE. femoralis, could serve as a source of colonists for emigration into new areas and does not represent a barrier to dispersal for this species. These results argue against generalization of edge effects for different taxa.'

Abstract: 'Reconstruction of Highway BR-319 (Manaus-Porto Velho) would allow for access from the \xe2\x80\x9carc of deforestation\xe2\x80\x9d in the southern part of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Amazon region to vast blocks of forests in central and northern Amazonia. Building roads is known to be a major driver of deforestation, allowing entry of squatters, and other actors. Rather than deforestation along the highway route, here we consider the road\xe2\x80\x99s potential for stimulating deforestation in a separate location, approximately 550\xc2\xa0km north of BR-319\xe2\x80\x99s endpoint in Manaus. Reconstructing BR-319 has great potential impact to start a new wave of migration to this remote region. The southern portion of the state of Roraima, the focus of our study, is already connected to Manaus by Highway BR-174. We modeled deforestation in southern Roraima and simulated carbon emissions between 2007 and 2030 under four scenarios. Simulations used the AGROECO model in DINAMICA-EGO \xc2\xa9 software. Two scenarios were considered with reconstruction of BR-319 and two without this road connection. For each of the two possibilities regarding BR-319, simulations were developed for (1) a \xe2\x80\x9cconservation\xe2\x80\x9d (CONSERV) scenario that assumes the creation of a series of protected areas, and (2) a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness-as-usual\xe2\x80\x9d (BAU) scenario that assumes no additional protected areas. Results show that by 2030, with BR-319 rebuilt, deforestation carbon emissions would increase between 19\xc2\xa0% (CONSERV) and 42\xc2\xa0% (BAU) over and above those corresponding to no-road scenarios.'

Abstract: 'Tree diversity (\xe2\x89\xa530 cm gbh) in undisturbed and human-impacted tropical evergreen forest sites was investigated in the Kolli hills, Eastern Ghats, India. Four 2-ha contiguous permanent plots were erected, one each in Perumakkai shola (site PS), Vengodai shola (VS), Kuzhivalavu shola (KS) and Mottukkadu shola (MS) at 1000, 1050, 1200 and 1250 m elevation, with increasing human disturbance, to evaluate the difference in tree species composition, stand structure and dynamics. This paper discusses the results of the first survey. A total of 3825 individuals and 78 species from 61 genera and 36 families were enumerated in the 8 ha area. Among the four 2-ha sites, species richness was greatest (58) in the undisturbed site PS and lowest (39) in the highly disturbed site MS. Shannon, Simpson, Hill diversity and evenness indexes revealed a progressive reduction in diversity with increasing disturbance. The asymptote species-area curves imply adequate site sampling. Tree density (1151 to 651 trees ha\xe2\x88\x922) and basal area (106 to 46.6 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x922) decreased from undisturbed to disturbed site, due to selective felling. Single species, Memecylon umbellatum dominated sites MS (39%) and VS (26%), while Nothopegia heyneana, Memecylon umbellatum and Diospyros ovalifolia were dominant in PS, and Meliosma simplicifolia, Myristica dactyloides and Phoebe wightii in KS. Based on species abundance, we classify the study area as Memecylon\xe2\x80\x93Phoebe\xe2\x80\x93Beilschmiedia association with Neolitsea and Myristica as codominants. Tree population structure revealed a step-wise decline in girth frequencies with increasing size class in undisturbed site PS, whereas tree density fell sharp (>50%) in medium girth class in the disturbed site MS. Population of the dominant species varied widely. The diversity values of this inventory are compared with similar studies in India and other tropical forests. Evidently, the reduction in species richness (by 52%), basal area (56%) and tree density (58%) in disturbed sites, with 57.6% of species rarity of this tropical evergreen forest, in secluded patches (\xe2\x80\x98sholas\xe2\x80\x99) of Kolli hills, underlines conservation need to prevent species loss.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon River Basin encompasses the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest remaining tropical rainforest, and the largest freshwater system with the highest fish species diversity on earth, but global climate change is predicted to cause the loss of 7\xe2\x80\x9312% of fish species by 2070. The severe drought anomaly of 2005, caused by warming of Atlantic surface waters, provided a unique opportunity to examine the impact of a major climatic disturbance on a tropical fish assemblage. We monitored fish species diversity in six Brazilian floodplain lakes along the Solim\xc3\xb5es River from 2004 to 2007 (before, during, and after drought). Statistical analysis revealed changes in species composition of these lakes following the drought, with both positive and negative responses observed. The response to drought was not uniform among species with regard to trophic guild or migratory behavior. SIMPER analysis showed that planktivores on the average increased in abundance in the years following the drought, carnivores and omnivores decreased, and herbivores and detritivores increased. Some of these changes were transitory, others persisted through monitoring. Migratory species disproportionately increased in abundance post-drought compared to non-migratory species. Interlake (\xce\xb2) diversity of fish declined during the drought year, indicating that lakes were becoming less heterogeneous in species composition, but showed a trend toward recovery of pre-drought level in the following years. According to both global climate change models and recent experience, the intensity and frequency of droughts in this region of the world is increasing. Given the sensitivity of resident fish species to the single, short-term, perturbation reported here, assessment of how tropical freshwater fish populations respond to drought will be crucial to understanding the consequences of this kind of perturbation to these communities and to the human inhabitants who depend upon this important protein source.'

Abstract: 'The Neotropical savanna is characterized by a set of different phytophysiognomies occurring in a wide expanse of Brazilian lands. Based on the known higher diversity of orchid bees in forests rather than in savanna formations, we hypothesized that the occurrence of forest formations inside the Brazilian savanna increases the diversity of euglossine bees in that domain and that there are species more associated with these environments. To test this hypothesis, we sampled the euglossine fauna in eight forest and woody savanna remnants and analyzed their community structure. We sampled 1,010 males of 13 species of orchid bees. Bee abundance and species richness ranged from 30 to 341 individuals and from 4 to 12 species, respectively. The forest remnants showed the highest diversity indices and species richness. Our data suggest that some species of Euglossa are mainly associated with forest remnants. We concluded that environmental heterogeneity in the Neotropical savanna contributes to higher diversity of euglossine and that some species are more frequently found in forested habitats. Additionally, considering that some sampled species are typical of the Atlantic and Amazon forests, our data reinforce the hypothesis that forest environments inside the Brazilian savanna can be considered bio-corridors for orchid bees.'

Abstract: "Populations of amphibians and reptiles are experiencing new or increasing threats to their survival. Many of these threats are directly attributable to human activity and resource development.This presents the increasing need for worldwide amphibian and reptile assessments and effective, standardized monitoring protocols. Adaptive management techniques can assist managers in identifying and mitigating threats to amphibian and reptile populations. In 1996, Shell Prospecting and Development, Peru initiated a natural gas exploration project in the rainforest of southeastern Peru. The Smithsonian Institution's Monitoring andAssessment of Biodiversity Program worked closely with Shell engineers and managers to establish an adaptive management program to protect the region's biodiversity. In this manuscript,we discuss the steps we took to establish an adaptive managementprogram for amphibian and reptile communities in the region. Wedefine and outline the conceptual issues involved in establishingan assessment and monitoring program, including setting objectives, evaluating the results and making appropriate decisions. We also provide results from the assessment anddiscuss the appropriateness and effectiveness of protocols and criteria used for selecting species to monitor."

Abstract: 'The biological, physical and social values of tropical moist forests (TMFs) can be defined from a subjective human viewpoint. The fragility of these forests, i.e. their reaction to outside forces, is determined by their nature and by ecological principles, both of which are largely objective. The forest, as a complex living system, acts as an objective entity. If utilization exceeds what the forest can sustain, degradation will set in and eventually may effect essential ecological processes and diminish genetic diversity.'

Abstract: 'Phylogeographic perspectives incorporating multiple classes of characters, especially those relating to sexual signals, are promising for the elucidation of recent evolutionary mechanisms driving speciation. Here, forest frogs were used as a model system to access distinct stages in the process of evolutionary differentiation. We studied 280 individuals assigned to three species: Allobates paleovarzensis, A. nidicola and A. masniger. Samples were collected at 20 localities arranged in two study systems, along the middle Amazon and the lower Madeira Rivers, in Central Amazonia. Mantel tests, analyses of molecular variance, and the spatial distribution of haplogroups indicated that the distribution of genetic variability, as inferred from a mitochondrial DNA marker, was determined by a combination of isolation-by-distance effects and the transposition of large Amazonian rivers. These two factors had contrasting relative influences in each of the study systems, which also differed regarding the estimated time of the major cladogenetic events. Pronounced population genetic structure was observed. However, multivariate discriminant function analyses revealed that the phenotypic (morphological and acoustic) divergence was loosely related with genetic differentiation and did not successfully predict assignment of individuals to genetic groups. The observed distribution of genetic variability showed the important role of genetic drift in the diversification of the mitochondrial marker studied. The phenotypic conservatism among populations was surprising in view of the high genetic structuring observed, and indicates a prevailing role of stabilizing selective forces in the process of sexual signal and morphological differentiation.'

Abstract: 'Standard petrographic methods were used to study 604 modern sands from South America, of which 351 came from rivers and 253 from beaches. In spite of the wide geomorphic contrasts, these sands belong to only three great families: (1) an immature Andean family of lithic arenites rich in volcanic and metamorphic grains that covers about 30% of South America; (2) a cratonic association rich in quartz that covers about 62% of the continent; and (3) a transitional, molasse association, which occurs between these two and covers only about 8% of the continent. The grand arithmetic average Q:F: Rf ratio for the entire continent is 60:11:29 and the area-weighted, carbonate-free average Qa:Fa:Rfa is 68:10:22, a superior continental estimate, and the first ever for an entire continent.'

Abstract: 'Processes of spatial mobility among the Mbya are of interest in anthropological and ethnobiological studies, as these processes are related to transformations in the landscape and the environment. Despite this, ethnographic literature usually focuses itself on the mobility of Guaran\xc3\xad communities from the perspective of population dynamics on a regional scale.'

Abstract: 'Traditional fallow systems of Latin America have not been extensively studied from either a socioeconomic or biophysical viewpoint. Only in the past decade have some of these systems \xe2\x80\x94 modified shifting cultivation in the Amazon, the bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella) fallow of southeastern Brazil, the babassu (Attalea spp.) system of the Amazon margins, and short bush fallows mostly for Phaseolus bean (the so-called \xe2\x80\x98frijol tapado\xe2\x80\x99) \xe2\x80\x94 received any attention. Over the past century, traditional cultivators have adopted several legumes such as Mucuna spp., Lathyrus nigrivalis, Canavalia spp., and Senna guatemalensis as green manures or managed fallows in food crop production systems, which have recently been the object of studies by social and biological scientists. Longer, monospecific fallows involving woody legumes have been studied to varying degrees. The legumes include Senna guatemalensis, Mimosa tenuiflora, and Gliricidia sepium. Systems in which crop production is alternated with animal grazing of secondary vegetation include the \xe2\x80\x98caatinga\xe2\x80\x99 of Northeast Brazil, the \xe2\x80\x98espinales\xe2\x80\x99 of Chile, the \xe2\x80\x98matorrales\xe2\x80\x99 of northern Mexico, and the \xe2\x80\x98chaco\xe2\x80\x99 of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. A classification is proposed depending on the nature of the species (woody or nonwoody) and their composition (mono- or multispecies) and land management (burned or not). Much work is still needed in more complete characterization, determination of economic importance and potential, understanding the relationships among components, studies of nutrient cycling, and verification of the effects of shorter fallow periods of these systems.'

Abstract: 'Tropical deforestation is a current anthropogenic change to the land surface. Tropical forests are known to be changing rapidly, but the rate and extent of deforestation and the resulting secondary cover, as would be needed for quantitative projections of future change, are difficult to establish now. Also necessary for climate simulations is a description of the micrometeorological processes within the forest canopy, including especially the processes of evapotranspiration and interception. Past General Circulation Model sensitivity studies have established the potential major significance of perturbation of surface energy processes. Climate modeling sensitivity studies and ecological systems studies have highlighted the importance of the surface energy balance and the hydrological cycle over continental areas. However, predicting even the local, immediate effects of replacing tropical broadleaved forest with impoverished grassland is difficult because the land-surface parameterization schemes used in most climate models have been inadequate.'

Abstract: 'Little attention has been paid to plant mutualistic interactions in the Amazon rainforest, and the general pattern of occurrence and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in these ecosystems is largely unknown. This study investigated AMF communities through their spores in soil in a \xe2\x80\x98terra firme forest\xe2\x80\x99 in Central Amazonia. The contribution played by abiotic factors and plant host species identity in regulating the composition, abundance and diversity of such communities along a topographic gradient with different soils and hydrology was also evaluated. Forty-one spore morphotypes were observed with species belonging to the genera Glomus and Acaulospora, representing 44\xc2\xa0% of the total taxa. Soil texture and moisture, together with host identity, were predominant factors responsible for shaping AMF communities along the pedo-hydrological gradient. However, the variability within AMF communities was largely associated with shifts in the relative abundance of spores rather than changes in species composition, confirming that common AMF species are widely distributed in plant communities and all plants recruited into the forest are likely to be exposed to the dominant sporulating AMF species.'

Abstract: 'In this paper, the CCMOB model is used to study the effect of the deforestation on the climate of China and its neighboring regions. On the assumption that the forest in China would be replaced by the vegetation(such as grassland), the distribution of the albedo changed was calculated. The initial fields used were taken from the FGGE zonal mean data on 16 July, 1979. In the control simulation, the observed albedo data were used to modify the physical parameters of the original model. The control and sensitive experiments were run each for 210 days, in which the external forcing fields were fixed in July. As a result, we find that the East Asian Monsoon, Hadley cell and troposphere easterly jet are weakened for the deforestation in China. The precipitation and cloud amount over China are also decreased. The changes in evaporation and surface temperature are small. The results also show that the deforestation in China exerts a remarkable effect on the climate in the neighboring regions of China.'

Abstract: 'Spodoptera marima (Schaus, 1904) and Spodoptera ornithogalli (Guen\xc3\xa9e, 1852) are noctuid moths recognized for their economic importance in the New World. Historically, they have been considered cryptic species, being supposedly differentiated from each other by the absence of sexual dimorphism in S. marima, subtle differences in coloration on the hindwings and scale tufts of the ovipositor and the shape of male valva. The species are allopatric: North and Central America for S. ornithogalli and South America for S. marima. Previous phylogenetic studies using multilocus DNA sequences including a few specimens of S. marima suggested these species merge into a single clade. Here, we performed a comparative analysis to elucidate further their taxonomic status, using specimens of S. marima from various localities in Brazil. These species were recovered in the phylogenetic analysis as consistently mixed with each other in a major well-supported clade within Spodoptera. The existence of a spatial pattern for genetic structure was not clearly supported when two biogeographic regions (Neotropics and Neartic) were taken in separation; however, an individual-level isolation by distance was significant. The morphological characters traditionally used to differentiate the species were also not consistent. Therefore, we now consider S. marima a new junior synonym of S. ornithogalli. Results on host plant use demonstrated that it is a polyphagous species using more than 200 plants, which may mediate phenotypic variation along its geographical range.'

Abstract: 'By comparing results from studies on the response of bird communities to selective logging and fragmentation of tropical moist forest and assessing whether different local faunas are differently affected, this paper examines whether communities in areas of unstable ecoclimatic histories may be more robust to change than those which evolved in places which were paleoecologically stable. Studies on selective logging in Asia and forest fragmentation in Latin America do not confidently demonstrate differences in the resilience of bird communities between stable and unstable areas. However, studies of selective logging and forest fragmentation in Africa give much stronger evidence for differences in fragility of local avifaunas, which correspond to what would be predicted from the paleoecological stability. Unfortunately, the currently available studies do not provide a basis for rigorous testing of the hypothesis. Comparison is constrained by lack of suitable controls, incomparable census methods, inadequate description of the disturbance regimes, and differences in the intensity of disturbance. It is suggested that well coordinated studies in many different areas, with good and standardized documentation of many habitat variables, may have considerable importance.'

Abstract: 'A case study on the nutrient input-output budget of slash and burn agriculture was carried out in Northeast-Par\xc3\xa1, Brazil, where such a land-use system has been practised for about 100 years. A common cropping period lasts for two years and the fields lie fallow for 4 to 8 years. We quantified rates of deposition, fertilization, and losses due to the burn, harvest and leaching. Six fields of different phases in the rotational cycle were under study during a 19 month period. During the fallow period, the input of Na, K, Mg, N, P and S via deposition exceeded the estimated losses with the seepage water. The Ca budget was almost balanced. The balance of fields in the transition from the fallow to the cropping phase was negative for Na, K, Ca, Mg, N, and S. The P balance was positive when NPK fertilizer was applied, and negative without fertilizer application. The nutrient balance for K, Mg, Ca, N, and P was also negative on the field in transition from the cropping to the fallow period. The nutrient budget for an entire land-use cycle of 9 years was estimated by the \xe2\x80\x9cfalse time series approach\xe2\x80\x9d. In the case of an NPK fertilization during the cropping period there were net losses of 75 kg K ha\xe2\x88\x921, 125 kg Ca ha\xe2\x88\x921, 16 kg Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921, 285 kg N ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 13 kg S ha\xe2\x88\x921. Na (86 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921) and P (11 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921) were accumulated. The harvest was the most important flux for the K (61%) and P (62%) output. The element transfer into the atmosphere during the burn caused the main losses of N (60%), S (65%), Ca (58%) and Mg (41%). The most important path of Na loss was leaching (92%). The net K losses were severe as they represented 45% of the K store found extractable in the soil down to 1m depth and in the above ground biomass. The presented results may be useful in planning a sustainable and environmentally protective method of land-use within a shifting cultivation system. It is strongly recommended that slash burning be abandoned in order to keep the nutrients in the ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon rainforest has an iconic position in the global conservation movement: not only is it the largest continuous tropical rainforest in the world, but it also encapsulates many of the greatest challenges facing twentieth century conservation. However, while deforestation and its potential impact on global climate systems (Malhi et al. 2008) grab most of the headlines, it is easy to forget that Amazonia is also home to a large and diverse human population (Ribeiro and Fabr\xc3\xa9 2003). In addition to the remaining indigenous tribes, there are many settlements and scattered communities of fishermen and farmers of mixed ethnic origins. The support and active engagement of these communities in conservation and sustainable resource management is essential for the success of any conservation or sustainable development initiative.'

Abstract: 'New World orthohantaviruses are emerging RNA viruses that cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These viruses are a burden to public health around the world with a lethality rate of around 60%. In South America, rodents of Sigmodontinae subfamily are the main reservoirs of orthohantaviruses. We described a serosurvey for orthohantaviruses circulation in an apparently healthy human population and small mammals from rural areas in Central Minas Gerais State, Brazil. A total of 240 individuals and 50 small mammals (26 rodents belonging to 10 different species and 24 marsupials from 4 different species) were sampled during 2012\xe2\x80\x932013. The seroprevalence rates of IgG/IgM antibodies in humans were 7.1 and 1.6%, respectively. Only one rodent, an Oligoryzomys nigripes captured in peridomestic area, tested positive for IgG antibodies and viral RNA. Our findings suggest a silent circulation of orthohantaviruses in a region of intensive agriculture production. The detection of seropositive humans in an area with a lack of previous HCPS reports highlights potential oligosymptomatic cases and the need for surveillance strategies that could reduce the risk of future outbreaks.'

Abstract: 'Brightness temperature observations from Microwave Sounding Unit and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) on board National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites have been widely utilized for estimating the global climate trend in the troposphere and stratosphere. A common approach for deriving the trend is\xc2\xa0linear regression, which implicitly assumes the trend being a straight line over the whole length of a time series and is often highly sensitive to the data record length. This study explores a new adaptive and temporally local data analysis method\xe2\x80\x94Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD)\xe2\x80\x94for estimating the global trends. In EEMD, a non-stationary time series is decomposed adaptively and locally into a sequence of amplitude-frequency modulated oscillatory components and a time-varying trend. The AMSU-A data from the NOAA-15 satellite over the time period from October 26, 1998 to August 7, 2010 are employed for this study. Using data over Amazon rainforest areas, it is shown that channel 3 is least sensitive to the orbital drift among four AMSU-A surface sensitive channels. The decadal trends of AMSU-A channel 3 and other eight channels in the troposphere and stratosphere are deduced and compared using both methods. It is shown that the decadal climate trends of most AMSU-A channels are nonlinear except for channels 3\xe2\x80\x934 in Northern Hemisphere only and channels 12\xe2\x80\x9313. Although the decadal trend variation of the global average brightness temperature is no more than 0.2\xc2\xa0K, the regional decadal trend variation could be more (less) than 3\xc2\xa0K (\xe2\x88\x923\xc2\xa0K) in high latitudes and over high terrains.'

Abstract: 'Environmental changes of the last 9,300\xc2\xa0years were reconstructed by geochemical and pollen analyses of a 14-m-long, laminated sediment core from Lago Aleixo, south-eastern Brazil. Fossil pollen assemblages indicate open savannah vegetation (campo cerrado) and gallery forests until approximately 6,900\xc2\xa0cal. BP. During that time, siderite laminae were deposited under anoxic conditions at the lake bottom. Then, increased rainfall and a shorter annual dry period allowed gallery forests and semi-deciduous forests to expand, leading to more closed cerrado vegetation. High-intensity rainfall events during this period are recorded as peaks in K and Ti concentrations. The sediment facies during this period consists of alternating layers of diatoms and minerogenic matter. C/N ratios imply that algae and perhaps soils, too, were the main contributors to sediment organic matter. Biogenic silica and \xce\xb413Corg variations indicate increasing primary productivity, which was related to higher nutrient flux from intensified leaching of soils, as shown by rising K/Al ratios. Around 800\xc2\xa0cal. BP, a closed, semi-deciduous forest developed under present-day climate conditions. Slope stabilization diminished erosion processes in the catchment and caused reduced input of minerogenic matter into the basin. Human impact is evident in the topmost homogeneous sediments, as removal of the stabilizing forest cover amplified soil erosion. The continuous trend to more humid conditions during the Holocene probably reflects increased influence of the Amazon Basin as a moisture source. We conclude that the Lago Aleixo sediment archive was a sensitive recorder of environmental dynamics in tropical South America, which were mainly controlled by changes in precipitation patterns.'

Abstract: ' The suitability of the natural 15N abundance and of total N concentration of leaves as indicators of the type of plant N nutrition in a rain forest of French Guiana were tested. Leaf samples from primary legume species, non-legumes (pioneer species) and from the non-N2-fixing species Dicorynia guianensis were analyzed. Both \xce\xb415N and total leaf N varied widely (\xe2\x88\x921 ?\xce\xb415N (\xe2\x80\xb0) ? 7 and 1\xe2\x80\x89?\xe2\x80\x89leaf N(%) ? 3.2) suggesting possible distinctions between diazotrophic and non-fixing plants. The \xce\xb415N also revealed two statistically distinct groups of non-N2-fixing species (\xce\xb415N\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895.14 \xc2\xb1 0.3 vs \xce\xb415N\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.17) related to the different ecological behaviors of these species in the successional processes. We conclude that the \xce\xb415N signature of plant leaves combined with their total N concentration may be relevant indicators for identifying functional groups within the community of non-N2-fixing species, as well as for detecting diazotrophy. Despite the variability in the \xce\xb415N of the non-N2-fixing species, N2-fixing groups can still be identified, provided that plants are simultaneously classified taxonomically, by their leaf \xce\xb415N and total N concentration and by the presence or absence of nodules. The variability in the \xce\xb415N of the non-fixing species is discussed.'

Abstract: 'Nutrient-poor soils often support low-stature grasslands, savannas and shrublands where the climate is warm enough and wet enough for closed forests. Though this pattern has long been recognised, the causes are debated and poorly explored. I tested the hypothesis that forest fails to develop where the total nutrient pool is too small to construct both the foliage and the wood. I estimated potential woody biomass from the difference between soil nutrient stocks and forest foliage stocks. Nutrient stocks required for foliage were estimated from leaf tissue concentrations and foliage biomass typical of Amazon forests. Potential wood biomass was estimated from wood nutrient concentrations typical of Amazon forests. Data on soil nutrient stocks were assembled from studies from South American and African forests and savannas and from south-western Australian and south-west African heathlands. According to these calculations, estimated nutrient stocks (kg ha\xe2\x88\x921) to build a forest would need to be > = P: 20\xe2\x80\x9330, K 200\xe2\x80\x93350, Ca 300\xe2\x80\x93600 and Mg 55\xe2\x80\x9365. Many surface soil horizons from both savanna and heathland sites were below these thresholds. However when deeper soil layers were included, most soils had adequate nutrient stocks. The nutrients in shortest supply were Ca and K and not P. This study suggests that nutrient stocks are usually adequate for constructing the wood needed to build a forest, except where soils are highly leached and very shallow. The implication is that, at steady state, low nutrient stocks seldom constrain forest development. The apparent failure of low nutrient stocks to explain the missing forests on nutrient-poor soils emphasises the need for new ideas on how nutrients, alone or in combination with other factors such as fire, influence vegetation structure.'

Abstract: 'Recent work has indicated that tropical forest and savanna can be alternative stable states under a range of climatic conditions. However, dynamical systems theory suggests that in case of strong spatial interactions between patches of forest and savanna, a boundary between both states is only possible at conditions in which forest and savanna are equally stable, called the \xe2\x80\x98Maxwell point.\xe2\x80\x99 Frequency distributions of MODIS tree-cover data at 250\xc2\xa0m resolution were used to estimate such Maxwell points with respect to the amount and seasonality of rainfall in both South America and Africa. We tested on a 0.5\xc2\xb0 scale whether there is a larger probability of local coexistence of forests and savannas near the estimated Maxwell points. Maxwell points for South America and Africa were estimated at 1760 and 1580\xc2\xa0mm mean annual precipitation and at Markham\xe2\x80\x99s Seasonality Index values of 50 and 24\xc2\xa0%. Although the probability of local coexistence was indeed highest around these Maxwell points, local coexistence was not limited to the Maxwell points. We conclude that critical transitions between forest and savanna may occur when climatic changes exceed a critical value. However, we also conclude that spatial interactions between patches of forest and savanna may reduce the hysteresis that can be observed in isolated patches, causing more predictable forest-savanna boundaries than continental-scale analyses of tree cover indicate. This effect could be less pronounced in Africa than in South America, where the forest-savanna boundary is substantially affected by rainfall seasonality.'

Abstract: 'The Reduced-Impact Logging Project, a pilot carbon offset project, was initiated in 1992 when a power company provided funds to a timber concessionaire to implement timber-harvesting guidelines in dipterocarp forest. The rationale for the offset is that when logging damage is reduced, more, carbon is retained in living trees, and, because soil damage is minimized, forest productivity remains high. To estimate the carbon benefit associated with implementation of harvesting guidelines, a monitoring program was developed based on 1) field studies for measuring carbon stocks and flows; 2) a computer model of forest carbon dynamics for simulating various combinations of harvesting intensity and damage; and, 3) a projection model for calculating carbon balance over the project lifespan. Seventy-five percent of the carbon stored in this forest is in biomass, and of this, 59% is in large, trees (\xe2\x89\xa76- cm, diameter); consequently, reliable estimates of variables related to large trees are critical to the estimate of carbon benefits. Allometric methods for estimating belowground biomass are recommended over pit-sampling methods because of low cost-effectiveness of obtaining precise estimates of woody root biomass. Sensitivity analyses of variables used in the simulation model suggest that maintenance of ecosystem productivity has a large influence on long-term carbon storage in the forest. Projections of differences in carbon stores between the reduced-impact and conventional logging sites rely on assumptions about tree mortality, growth, and recruitment; published, data for comparable sites in Malaysia are probably appropriate for estimating forest recovery from conventional but not reduced-impact logging. Continuing field work is expected to provide the data needed to evaluate assumptions of the models.'

Abstract: 'Studies with Nasutitermes and Rhynchotermes (Isoptera, Nasutitermitinae) in a Costa Rican rainforest suggest that nitrogen fixation by gut symbionts may play a significant role in termite nutrition. Leaf-litter feeders ingest more and fix less nitrogen than do wood-litter feeders; both species feed preferentially on N-rich foods in their foraging repertoire. Unusually high N2 fixation (acetylene reduction) rates were found in Nasutitermes soldiers, thereby reducing their nutritional dependence on workers. Finally, N2 fixation rates of termites diminished rapidly within 24 h after removal of a colony from the field, underlining the importance of conducting future N2 fixation studies under field conditions.'

Abstract: 'Clonal growth is of great importance for survival, growth, expansion, and resource utilization of some species. Knowing how clonal plants respond morphologically and physiologically to different light environments can be useful to explain their occurrence and abundance patterns under specific environmental conditions. Responses of clonal growth, leaf gas exchange, fluorescence emission, and photosynthetic pigment concentrations to different light environments (100, 60, 30, and 15%) were studied in Amomum villosum, grown in the traditional way for economic purpose in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. The results showed that A. villosum attained vigorous clonal growth under 30% and 60% light, with a higher plant height, number of ramets, stolon length, thicker stems and stolons. Shade-grown A. villosum possessed a larger leaf area than that of the sun-grown plants in order to capture more light. For A. villosum, the higher light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, light-saturation point, larger fresh and dry biomass can explained the better clonal growth for A. villosum under 30% and 60% light. Amomum villosum attained the highest values of minimal chlorophyll fluorescence under 100% light and the lowest values of maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII under 15% light. Our findings indicated that the full irradiance was too strong and 15% light was too weak for A. villosum plants. It was also verified by higher concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in the shaded plants compared to those grown under full sun light. Our results suggested that A. villosum seemed to be adapted to moderate light environment (60\xe2\x80\x9330%) which was indicated by vigorous clonal growth and higher photosynthesis. This information is very useful to select clonal species for rainforest or understory projects. The cultivation of A. villosum in rainforest should not be done under too strong (100%) or too weak light environment (less than 15%).'

Abstract: 'Headland and Bailey (1991) argued in Human Ecology that tropical forests could not support long-term human foraging in the absence of agriculture. Part of their thesis was based on the fact that supposedly isolated \xe2\x80\x98forest\xe2\x80\x99 foragers, such as the Wanniyalaeto (or Vedda) peoples of Sri Lanka, could be demonstrated to be enmeshed within historical trade networks and rely on crops as part of their overall subsistence. Yet, in the same volume and in the years that followed scholars have presented ethnographic and archaeological evidence, including from Sri Lanka, that counter this proposition, demonstrating the occupation and exploitation of tropical rainforest environments back to 38,000\xc2\xa0years ago (ka) in this part of the world. However, archaeological and ethnohistorical research has yet to quantify the overall reliance of human foragers on tropical forest\xc2\xa0resources through time. Here, we report stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from historical Wanniyalaeto individuals from Sri Lanka, in full collaboration with the present-day members of this group, that suggest that while a number of individuals made use of agricultural resources in the recent past, others subsisted primarily on tropical forest resources as late as the 1800s.'

Abstract: 'Satellite images were used to determine rates of deforestation over the past 35 years and to identify current deforestation \xe2\x80\x9chotspots\xe2\x80\x9d in the eastern rainforests and in the dry endemic forests of southern Madagascar. The analysis of population trends, topography, and coincident ethnographic research points to a number of different factors influencing deforestation in these regions. Each of these factors generates different problems for conservation and development, most of which are not being dealt with adequately.'

Abstract: 'This paper uses a variety of historical evidence from Indonesia to explore the conditions for sustainable management of natural resources. In the agricultural sphere, history gives reason for optimism regarding the ability of individuals to conserve and improve soil resources on an uncoordinated, anarchic basis under systems of intensive smallholder farming and agroforestry. It also suggests that this ability may be enhanced, rather than eroded, both by population growth and by the commercialization of agriculture. When it comes to the management of forests and fisheries and the conservation of nature, by contrast, there is less reason for optimism. If sustainable solutions are to be found in these spheres, the historical evidence suggests that they will involve political hierarchy, and will depend on the honouring of a social contract in which the state serves the public interest while retaining the powers of coercion which it needs in order to do just that.'

Abstract: 'Literature on environmental change often highlights the importance of public policies as a key driver of land use and land cover change. However, demonstration of policy impacts in agricultural settings has been hampered by the lack of systematic analysis across landholders, who may not universally adopt government policy incentives, or time periods, which may be associated with differing policy regimes. This paper evaluates the importance of voluntary adoption of policy incentives offered by Peruvian government administrations over two decades for land-use among small farmers in the Peruvian Amazon. The analysis focuses on whether farmers adopted one or more policy incentives in order to observe the effects on land uses including mature forest, agricultural crops, cattle pasture, and secondary growth. We employ multivariate statistical models to estimate the effects of policy adoption while controlling for other factors. The findings show that distinct policies are associated with particular land-uses and largely follow expectations. Specifying policy incentives promulgated by governments and differentiating among adopters and non-adopters advances understanding of the impacts of public policies on land use.'

Abstract: 'Siona-Secoya hunters of the northwest Amazon strive to maximize short-term yields to provision their households with meat. The observed patterns of hunting more closely resemble the predictions of optimal foraging theory (OFT) than they do a conservation ethic. In the past the Siona-Secoya worried little about conservation because they believed that good shamans attracted abundant game. When hunting was poor, shamans performedyag\xc3\xa9 ceremonies and appealed to supernatural gamekeepers for the release of more animals from the underworld. The sustainability of Siona-Secoya hunting was aided by factors such as low human population density, dispersed settlements within large hunting territories, settlement movement, and limited hunting technology. Today, increasing involvement in the national economy is leading the Siona-Secoya to invest more time in agriculture and wage labor, and less in traditional foraging activities. Colonization, deforestation, and industrial pollution now pose the greatest threats to wildlife in eastern Ecuador. Because of these changes, the Siona-Secoya are becoming interested in environmental protection and conservation. Several of their efforts to protect forest resources and mitigate pollution are discussed and evaluated.'

Abstract: 'The modernization of Brazilian agriculture beginning in the mid-1960s led to the massive out-migration of family farmers from Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s traditional \xe2\x80\x9cfarm-belt\xe2\x80\x9d in the subtropical South. The tropical forestlands of the Northwest frontier (Rond\xc3\xb4nia) were opened through a government program, POLONOROESTE, to absorb this displaced agrarian population. The results of this land settlement program have been disappointing. Agricultural production in Rond\xc3\xb4nia, emphasizing low-yield annual cropping and casual cattle ranching, has been accompanied by high rates of deforestation. Colonists migrating to Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Northwest frontier confront numerous obstacles to establishing and maintaining a viable farm. This article explores how colonists adapt to the changing factors of farm production. These factors occur at three levels: environmental, institutional/structural, and household level. Based on colonist household surveys, three principal and overlapping farming strategies were observed and their financial performance evaluated: annual cropping-only, coffee production, and cattle ranching. Three case studies are presented that illustrate how these strategies change over the short-term in ways that tend to favor temporary land uses.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the regional dynamics and natural resource use strategies related to the deforestation of tropical rain forests west of the Ecuadorian Andes for the period 1983\xe2\x80\x931995. Research was based on regional level analysis of remotely sensed and secondary data and local level analysis of the ways local populations use the resources at their disposal. The process observed departs significantly from what has been described in the literature for Latin America and should be seen as a window into a broader environmental process occurring in most tropical forests on the Pacific side of northern South America. Deforestation in the Northwest Ecuador is primarily related to a complex productive structure, made up a countless number of timber producers and middlemen, ranging from fully informal to fully formal, and from small scale to large scale. A key finding is that local traditional populations play a critical role through productive coalitions between small primary producers and large timber firms. These have been shaped by the articulation of local conditions with external markets, settlement processes, and the convergence of local populations in an economic system which relies on the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. If deforestation rates in Northwest Ecuador remain at current levels, forests in the region will disappear completely within 30\xe2\x80\x9335 years, a fate that is likely to be the same for most tropical rain forests west of the tropical Andes.'

Abstract: 'Most large reserves in Brazil do not hold viable populations of jaguars to guarantee the species\xe2\x80\x99 long-term survival. Corridors linking populations have been identified as a potential tool to avoid negative effects of isolation, increasing population viability. Here, we performed a Brazil-wide evaluation of potential large scale corridors connecting protected jaguar populations. Six variables (human population size, dam reservoir size, number of dams, roads, railways and cities) expected to negatively impact jaguar movement were analyzed across 180 potential corridors connecting 298 protected jaguar areas. We established overall disturbance scores for the corridors using a principal components analysis and compared them among the Brazilian biomes. We further investigated which variables separated biomes using a canonical variates analysis. The Atlantic Forest and the semi-arid Caatinga have the most impacted potential corridors, whereas the Amazon and Pantanal still have the best potential corridors. Corridor quality in the Cerrado grasslands was intermediate. All variables but human population size and corridor length contributed significantly to differences in corridor variables among biomes. Our conclusions suggest that we need to plan the implementation of large scale corridors in the Amazon, Pantanal and particularly the Cerrado soon, while potential corridors might still be economically viable. In the much more impacted Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, the need for conservation actions is strongest, but logistical difficulties and costs may turn implementation of corridors unfeasible.'

Abstract: 'Over the past century, human activities and their side effects have significantly threatened both ecosystems and resident species. Nevertheless, the genetic patterns of large felids that depend heavily on large and well-conserved continuous habitat remain poorly studied. Using the largest-ever contemporary genetic survey of wild jaguars (Panthera onca), we evaluated their genetic diversity and population structure in natural (Brazilian Amazon) and highly modified habitats (e.g. Cerrado, Caatinga) including those close to the northern (Yucatan, Mexico) and southern (Pantanal) edge of the species\xe2\x80\x99 distribution range. Data from our set of microsatellites revealed a pronounced genetic structure, with four genetically differentiated geographic areas. Geographic distance was not the only factor influencing genetic differentiation through the jaguar range. Instead, we found evidence of the effects of habitat deterioration on genetic patterns: while the levels of genetic diversity in the Amazon forest, the largest continuum habitat for the species, are high and consistent with panmixia across large distances, genetic diversity near the edge of the species distribution has been reduced through population contractions. Mexican jaguar populations were highly differentiated from those in Brazil and genetically depauperated. An isolated population from the Caatinga showed the genetic effects of a recent demographic decline (within the last 20\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0years), which may reflect recent habitat degradation in the region. Our results demonstrate that the jaguar is highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation especially in human-dominated landscapes, and that in Brazil, the existing but limited genetic connectivity in the central protected areas should be maintained. These conclusions have important implications for the management of wide-ranging species with high dispersal and low population density. The restoration of ecological connectivity between populations over relatively large scales should be one of the main priorities for species conservation.'

Abstract: 'Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s deforestation affects citizens from varying information communities. Experts like scientists or journalists acquire relevant data on-site and publish valuable information on the Web. But different and sometimes conflicting views on reality impede sharing of information across communities, relevant content remains far too often undiscovered. We introduce rule-based semantic annotations as solution to facilitate the discovery and evaluation of geographical information. With the distinction between shared domain and local information source ontologies, the proposed architecture of a semantically supported SDI for the Amazon also takes the plethora of GI formats into account. Creating semantic annotations is challenging, a recommender system for semantic annotations enables even the non-IT experts to participate. The benefits of the proposed techniques are further illustrated by a scenario which spans across information communities of economics, ecology, and ethnology.'

Abstract: 'The merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) gene encodes the major surface antigen of invasive forms of the Plasmodium erythrocytic stages and is considered a candidate vaccine antigen against malaria. Due to its polymorphisms, MSP1 is also useful for strain discrimination and consists of a good genetic marker. Sequence diversity in MSP1 has been analyzed in field isolates of three human parasites: P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale. However, the extent of variation in another human parasite, P. malariae, remains unknown. This parasite shows widespread, uneven distribution in tropical and subtropical regions throughout South America, Asia, and Africa. Interestingly, it is genetically indistinguishable from P. brasilianum, a parasite known to infect New World monkeys in Central and South America.'

Abstract: 'There may have been 4\xe2\x80\x935 million people in Amazonia at the time of European contact. These people cultivated or managed at least 138 plant species in 1492. Many of these crop genetic resources were human artifacts that required human intervention for their maintenance, i.e., they were in an advanced state of domestication. Consequently, there was a relationship between the decline of Amazonian Amerindian populations and the loss of their crop genetic heritage after contact. This relationship was influenced by the crop\xe2\x80\x99s degree of domestication, its life history, the degree of landscape domestication where it was grown, the number of human societies that used it, and its importance to these societies. Amazonian crop genetic erosion probably reflects an order of magnitude loss and the losses continue today.'

Abstract: 'A considerable body of empirical and theoretical literature on the causes of tropical deforestation has emerged over the last twenty years. Recognizing that small-farmers in the Amazon Basin are a key agent in the process of primary forest conversion, a growing genre of studies at the household level have attempted to quantify the influence of various factors on small-farmer land-use decisions. Many of these studies have acknowledged the seeming importance of urban centers as hubs of propulsive activity and information, yet none have comprehensively captured the \xe2\x80\x9curbanization factor\xe2\x80\x9d in rural land use decisions. I argue that this methodological shortcoming in empirical work to-date reflects an inadequate conceptualization of the range of urban-based networks and their inter-relationships. In an effort to overcome this roadblock to further empirical discovery, I review several leading schools of thought that might be pressed into service in developing a framework for interpreting the urban influences on rural landscapes. I call this construct the \xe2\x80\x9cUrban-Rural Interface.\xe2\x80\x9d This is not a complete theoretical model or a unique methodology, but rather an initial effort to develop a general framework from which more sophisticated formulations might proceed.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x9cMade in Brazil\xe2\x80\x9d: Human Dispersal of the Brazil Nut (Bertholletia excelsa, Lecythidaceae) in Ancient Amazonia. The Brazil nut, Bertholletia excelsa, is a colossal tree of terra firme forest whose seeds represent the most important non-timber forest product in Amazonia. Its peculiarly inefficient dispersal strategy and discontinuous distribution have led some to hypothesize anthropogenic origins, but evidence to date has been inconclusive. Here we present results of a multidisciplinary study addressing this question. A review of the geographic distribution of B. excelsa and comparison with that of similar Lecythis species suggest a number of anomalies that are consistent with a recent and wide colonization of Bertholletia. Published studies and field observations indicate that anthropogenic disturbance facilitates Brazil nut regeneration. Recent genetic studies showing no sequence diversity and no geographical structuring of within-population variability support a rapid and recent irradiation from an ancestral population. Historical linguistic analysis of indigenous terms for Brazil nut suggests a northern/eastern Amazonian origin for Bertholletia, with a concomitant spread of Brazil nut distribution or cultivation to the south and west. Such an expansion would have been particularly facilitated by the emergence of intensive bitter manioc cultivation and networks of interethnic trade beginning in the first millennium C.E. Together, ecological, phytogeographic, genetic, linguistic, and archeological data reinforce the hypothesis that ancient Amazonian peoples played a role in establishing this emblematic and economically important rainforest landscape.'

Abstract: 'The numerical regional model (Eta) coupled with the Simplified Simple Biosphere Model (SSiB) was used to investigate the impact of land cover changes on the regional climate in Amazonia. Four 13-month integrations were performed for the following scenarios: (a) no deforestation, (b) current conditions, (c) deforestation predicted for 2033, and (d) large scale deforestation. All initial and prescribed boundary conditions were kept identical for all integrations, except the land cover changes. The results show that during the dry season the post-deforestation decrease in root depth plays an important role in the energy budget, since there is less soil moisture available for evapotranspiration. In all scenarios there was a significant increase in the surface temperature, from 2.0\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0C in the first scenario, up to 2.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0C in the last one. In both the scenarios (b) and (c), the downward component of the surface solar radiation decreased due to an increase in the cloud cover over the deforested areas, which contributed to a further reduction of the net radiation absorbed at the surface. The cloud mechanism, where an increase in albedo is balanced by an increase in downward solar radiation, was not detected in any of these scenarios. In scenarios (a), (b) and (c), a negative feedback mechanism was observed in the hydrological cycle, with greater amounts of moisture being carried to the deforested areas. The increase in moisture convergence was greater than the reduction in evapotranspiration for both scenarios (b) and (c). This result, and the meso-scale thermodynamic processes caused an increase in precipitation. A different situation was observed in the large-scale deforestation scenario (d): a local increase of moisture convergence was observed, but not sufficiently intense to generate an increase in precipitation; the local evapotranspiration decrease was dominant in this scenario. Therefore, the partial deforestation in Amazonia can actually lead to an increase in precipitation locally. However, if the deforestation increases, this condition becomes unsustainable, leading to drier conditions and, consequently, to reduced precipitation in the region.'

Abstract: 'We present a series of computer-generated foraging models (random movement, olfactory navigation, and spatial memory) designed to examine the manner in which sensory cues and cognitive skills might be used by rainforest monkeys to locate patchily distributed feeding sites. These simulations are compared with data collected in the Amazon Basin of northeastern Peru on the foraging patterns of two species of neotropical primates, the moustached tamarin monkey (Saguinus mystax) and the saddle-back tamarin monkey (Saguinus fuscicollis). The results indicate that, although tamarins may rely on olfactory cues to locate nearby feeding sites, their foraging patterns are better explained by an ability to maintain a detailed spatial map of the location and distribution of hundreds of feeding trees in their home range. There is evidence that such informationis retained for a period of at least several weeks and is used to minimize the distance traveled between widely scattered feeding sites. The use of computer simulations provides a powerful research tool for generating predictive models regarding the role of memory and sensory cues in animal foraging patterns.'

Abstract: 'The mass-extinction episode underway is largely centred on tropical forests, insofar as they contain at least half of all Earth\'s species and they are being depleted faster than any other biome. But species distributions and depletion patterns are anything but uniform throughout the biome. This paper identifies 10 areas that, a) are characterised by exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism and b) are experiencing unusually rapid rates of depletion. While these "hotspot" areas comprise less than 3.5 percent of remaining primary forests, they harbour over 34 000 endemic plant species (27 percent of all plant species in tropical forests and 13 percent of all plant species worldwide). They also feature 700 000 endemic animal species and possibly several times more. Unfortunately, they appear likely to lose 90 percent of their forest cover as soon as the end of the century or shortly thereafter, causing the extinction of almost 7 percent of Earth\'s plant species and at least a similar proportion of animal species, this occurring in only 0.2 percent of Earth\'s land surface. By concentrating on such areas where needs are greatestand where the pay-off from safeguard measures would also be greatest, conservationists can engage in a more systematised response to the challenge of largescale extinctions impending in tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'Studies of the floral biology of the buriti palm, Mauritia flexuosa, have presented conflicting results with respect to the mechanism of pollination, indicating either cantharophily or anemophily. To resolve this question, the floral biology of M. flexuosa was studied in a coastal restinga environment in northeastern Brazil. The reproductive system was studied experimentally, and floral visitors were collected by bagging inflorescences. In this environment, M. flexuosa, a dioecious species, has several gender-specific floral features that function to attract pollinators, especially beetles. The male flowers produce large amounts of pollen as a reward, and male and female inflorescences produce similar odors that attract pollinators to female flowers, which offer only a nectar secretion as a reward. When feeding on the female flowers, the visitors frequently come into contact with the stigmata. To increase the chances of pollination, the female flowers persist longer than the male ones, and the viability of the pollen grain is very high. A curculionid beetle species of the genus Grasidius was found to be an effective pollinator. We suspect that wind also contributes to the pollination of M. flexuosa in the study area, but in a relatively minor way.'

Abstract: 'To undertake a comprehensive study of the disturbanceeffects due to mining activities (manganese oreexploitation) on the chemical composition of drainagewaters, a 164 ha catchment in North-eastern Amazoniatropical forest was sampled weekly for a year period(June 1993 to June 1994) to determine the contrasts inrainwater, throughfall and stream water chemistrybetween the upper undisturbed area and the lower partaffected by deforestation and mining works. During the3 dry months season only about 15% of the totalannual input-output of chemical species to and fromthe catchment occurs. In the three wettest months,about 30% of the flux occurs, except 60% of thepotassium and nitrate release from the catchmentoccurs in these three months. The rain waters areslightly acidic (pH \xe2\x89\x88 5.2) with lowalkalinity, while the stream water is nearly neutral(pH \xe2\x89\x88 6.9): alkalinity is generated within thesoil and soil water system. The rainfall-throughfallrelationship of the chemical species in the naturalareas exhibits strong internal recycling and littleexport from the catchment. In the area changed bydeforestation and mining works almost all chemicalspecies show a net export in surface waters: these aremainly derived from the deforested area of the basin,where most probably due to enhanced weatheringprocesses because the vegetation cover has tore-establish itself.'

Abstract: "This article takes a new approach to the question of identity politics among indigenous Amazonian communities, by relating it to brand theory. The discussion centres on the Kayap\xc3\xb3 of southern Par\xc3\xa0 in the Brazilian Amazon, who came into contact with The Body Shop in the early 1990s. Although it is commonly acknowledged that initial European contact with Indigenous communities proved devastating to their peoples, in their renewed contact with external forces, the Kayap\xc3\xb3 became known for strategically engaging with external bodies to obtain enhanced rights to territory and access to resources. In the process, a compelling narrative of Indian identity kindled an emotionally invested global audience's projection of Edenic Indian \xe2\x80\x98guardians of the forest\xe2\x80\x99, thus honing the creation of a pristine Indian \xe2\x80\x98brand\xe2\x80\x99. Framing the popularised Indian identity as a branding exercise, the author explores its appropriation by The Body Shop, and by the Kayap\xc3\xb3's own use of what developed into an essentialist discourse. This article offers an alternative critical approach to the widely problematised Indian conundrum from the perspective of branding technique, by highlighting the mechanisms and interactions that together have crafted the subjects\xe2\x80\x99 commoditised identity."

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82Global soil moisture data of high quality and resolution are not available by direct observation, but are useful as boundary and initial conditions in comprehensive climate models. In the framework of the GSWP (Global Soil Wetness Project), the ISBA land-surface scheme of M\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9o-France has been forced with meteorological observations and analyses in order to study the feasibility of producing a global soil wetness climatology at a 1\xc2\xb0\xc3\x971\xc2\xb0 horizontal resolution. A control experiment has been performed from January 1987 to December 1988, using the ISLSCP Initiative I boundary conditions. The annual mean, the standard deviation and the normalised annual harmonic of the hydrologic fields have been computed from the 1987 monthly results. The global maps which are presented summarise the surface hydrologic budget and its annual cycle. The soil wetness index and snow cover distributions have been compared respectively to the results of the ECMWF reanalysis and to satellite and in situ observations. The simulated runoff has been validated against a river flow climatology, suggesting a possible underestimation over some large river basins. Besides the control run, other simulations have been performed in order to study the sensitivity of the hydrologic budget to changes in the surface parameters, the precipitation forcing and the runoff scheme. Such modifications have a significant impact on the partition of total precipitation into evaporation and runoff. The sensitivity of the results suggests that soil moisture remains one of the most difficult climatological parameters to model and that any computed soil wetness climatology must be considered with great caution.'

Abstract: 'Many development projects intended to exploit natural resourcesare occurring in fragile ecosystems, and therefore the need forsound biodiversity assessment and monitoring programs is growing.Large mammals are important components of these fragile ecosystems, yet there are few strategies that attempt to assess and monitor entire large mammal communities in relation to development projects. We propose the use of two indices applied within a framework of adaptive management. An occurrence indexassesses the composition and distribution of large mammals at a site, and an abundance index monitors the abundance of large mammals over time in relation to development. We discuss the design, applicability and effectiveness of these indices based onour experience with a natural gas development project in the Amazon forests of southeastern Peru.'

Abstract: 'Environmental changes are expected to shift the distribution and abundance of vegetation by determining seedling establishment and success. However, most current ecosystem models only focus on the impacts of abiotic factors on biogeophysics (e.g., global distribution, etc.), ignoring their roles in the population dynamics (e.g., seedling establishment rate, mortality rate, etc.) of ecological communities. Such neglect may lead to biases in ecosystem population dynamics (such as changes in population density for woody species in forest ecosystems) and characteristics. In the present study, a new establishment scheme for introducing soil water as a function rather than a threshold was developed and validated, using version 1.0 of the IAP-DGVM as a test bed. The results showed that soil water in the establishment scheme had a remarkable influence on forest transition zones. Compared with the original scheme, the new scheme significantly improved simulations of tree population density, especially in the peripheral areas of forests and transition zones. Consequently, biases in forest fractional coverage were reduced in approximately 78.8% of the global grid cells. The global simulated areas of tree, shrub, grass and bare soil performed better, where the relative biases were reduced from 34.3% to 4.8%, from 27.6% to 13.1%, from 55.2% to 9.2%, and from 37.6% to 3.6%, respectively. Furthermore, the new scheme had more reasonable dependencies of plant functional types (PFTs) on mean annual precipitation, and described the correct dominant PFTs in the tropical rainforest peripheral areas of the Amazon and central Africa.'

Abstract: 'All of Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s indigenous Amazonian people use Carludovica palmata Ru\xc3\xadz & Pav\xc3\xb3n. The most frequent use is for roof thatching. Fibers from the petiole also are used to make baskets and to tie small timbers. The Shuar, Achuar and Quichua make mammal and fish traps from the petiole. The bases of unopened leaf buds and the fruits are edible. The buds have a taste similar to palm hearts. Carludovica palmata grows in open, disturbed sites often in alluvial soil. Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s indigenous people often protect the plant when clearing fields. They also intentionally plant it. The commercial use of its buds for food and the marketing of native crafts made from C. palmata could rival the plant\xe2\x80\x99s importance in the Panama hat industry.'

Abstract: 'Nitrogen oxides are key compounds for the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. NOx concentrations depend on the proximity of sources because of their short atmospheric lifetime. An accurate knowledge of the distribution of their sources and sinks is therefore crucial. At global scale, the dominant sources of nitrogen oxides - combustions of fossil fuel (\xe2\x88\xbc50%) and biomass burning (\xe2\x88\xbc20%) - are basically anthropogenic. Natural sources, including lightning and microbial activity in soils, represent therefore less than 30% of total emissions. Fertilizer use in agriculture constitutes an anthropogenic perturbation to the microbial source. The methods to estimate the magnitude and distribution of these dominant sources of nitrogen oxides are discussed. Some minor sources which may play a specific role in tropospheric chemistry such as NOx emission from aircraft in the upper troposphere or input from production in the stratosphere from N2O photodissociation are also considered.'

Abstract: 'Within a 30-ha permanent plot of a tropical evergreen forest in the Anamalais, Indian Western Ghats, all the 13\xe2\x80\x89415 trees \xe2\x89\xa530\xe2\x80\x89cm\xe2\x80\x89gbh (belonging to 153 species) were identified and tagged during 1997\xe2\x80\x931998. This communication reports the results of tree population changes based on two annual censuses (1999 and 2000) of the plot after the initial census, and compares the results with other tropical forest sites. One species, Ficus beddomei, disappeared from the plot and there was no new addition of species. Of the 96 species that showed changes in their population density, for 12 species recruitment and mortality matched. Tree recruitment (5 trees\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921) exceeded mortality (4 trees\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921) during the two-year period. Four modes of tree deaths were recorded in our site. The per cent mortality of trees differed between tree size classes during each recensus. The plot tree density increased progressively in the two-year period, indicating that shifts in species composition and density in natural forests, without major catastrophic disturbance, occur slowly.'

Abstract: 'This paper reports on the nesting ecology of blue-and-yellow macaws (Ara ararauna) and the structure, conservation, and management of the Mauritia flexuosa palm swamps where they nest: clutch size averaged 2.6 and the number of chicks fledged per nesting attempt was 0.5. Macaws nested in tall dead palms in healthy palm swamps and in palms of all heights in open dieing palm stands. All nesting palms rose well above the surrounding vegetation presumably to discourage terrestrial predators. PVC nest boxes failed to attract nesting blue-and-yellow macaws. A small section of palm swamp was managed to encourage macaw nesting by cutting the tops off of M. flexuosa palms and clearing the understory vegetation. The palms remained standing from 4 to 7\xc2\xa0years and were occupied by nesting macaws at a rate of 24%. The data presented here suggest that cutting five palms a year in perpetuity would produce a stand of approximately 20 standing dead palms used by 6 or more pairs of macaws annually. However, macaw occupancy rates would depend on the density of macaws and density of naturally occurring nest sites. This management scheme could be conducted on a 100-year rotation in an area of 1\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0ha or more depending on the palm density. Such a colony could be used to increase reproductive success of blue-and-yellow macaw populations, create a valuable ecotourism resource, and concentrate macaw nesting in protected areas.'

Abstract: 'Newly created academic programs at Brazilian universities have provided the impetus for new archaeological projects in southeastern South America during the last two decades. The new data are changing our views on emergent social complexity, natural and human-induced transformation of the landscape, and transcontinental expansions and cultural interactions across the R\xc3\xado de la Plata basin during the Middle and Late Holocene. We concentrate on six major archaeological traditions/regions: the Sambaquis, the Pantanal, the Constructores de Cerritos, the Tupiguarani, the Southern Proto-J\xc3\xaa, and the middle and lower Paran\xc3\xa1 River. Diverse and autonomous complex developments exhibit distinct built landscapes in a region previously thought of as marginal compared with cultural developments in the Andes or Mesoamerica. The trajectories toward increased sociopolitical complexity flourished in very different and changing environmental conditions. While some groups were pushed to wetland areas during a drier mid-Holocene, others took advantage of the more humid Late Holocene climate to intensively manage Araucaria forests. The start of the second millennium AD was a critical period marked by an increased number of archaeological sites, the construction of ceremonial architecture, and the intensification of landscape transformation; it also was marked by the rapid expansion of influences from outside the La Plata basin. The Amazonian Tupiguarani and Arawak newcomers brought with them significant changes in technologies and social and political structures, as well as novel landscape management practices.'

Abstract: ' We assembled information on the contribution and value of forests to world food security. An assessment was made of the role of forests and non-timber products in the food system of developing countries. We estimated that upwards of 300 million people annually earn part or all of their livelihood and food from forests. A total of about $90 billion in non-timber products are harvested each year. Forests also help to protect land, water, and biological resources, and they play an important role in maintaining the productivity of agricultural and environmental systems. '

Abstract: 'While many studies have measured the carbon (C) stocks of traditional agroforests at the plot level, their contribution to overall landscape C storage has rarely been quantified. Here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape C storage, and thus climate change mitigation, focusing on the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests (locally known as cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil. Using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms, 6 mature forests, 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows, we calculate average aboveground C stocks of 87 and 46\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests, respectively, 183\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in old-growth forests, 102\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in disturbed forests and 33\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in fallows. Based on the most recent land cover data available, we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59\xc2\xa0% of the total aboveground C stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape, while forests hold 32\xc2\xa0% and fallows hold 9\xc2\xa0%. Carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over one-half of those of traditional agroforests, indicating a threat to landscape C stocks from current land use trends. We show that in agroforests as in natural forests, C stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees. This suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests, which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees, is possible without greatly affecting their C storage if large trees are conserved. In order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climate-friendly solutions, we suggest that biodiversity and C-rich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and/or their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms.'

Abstract: "The relationships between resource availability, plant succession, and species' life history traits are often considered key to understanding variation among species and communities. Leaf lifespan is one trait important in this regard. We observed that leaf lifespan varies 30-fold among 23 species from natural and disturbed communities within a 1-km radius in the northern Amazon basin, near San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezuela. Moreover, leaf lifespan was highly correlated with a number of important leaf structural and functional characterisues. Stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) and both mass and area-based net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf lifespan (r2=0.74, 0.91 and 0.75, respectively). Specific leaf area (SLA) also decreased with increasing leaf lifespan (r2=0.78), while leaf toughness increased (r2=0.62). Correlations between leaf lifespan and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were moderate on a weight basis and not significant on an area basis. On an absolute basis, changes in SLA, net photosynthesis and leaf chemistry were large as leaf lifespan varied from 1.5 to 12 months, but such changes were small as leaf lifespan increased from 1 to 5 years. Mass-based net photosynthesis (A/mass) was highly correlated with SLA (r2=0.90) and mass-based leaf nitrogen (N/mass) (r2=0.85), but area-based net photosynthesis (A/area) was not well correlated with any index of leaf structure or chemistry including N/area. Overall, these results indicate that species allocate resources towards a high photosynthetic assimilation rate for a brief time, or provide resistant physical structure that results in a lower rate of carbon assimilation over a longer time, but not both."

Abstract: '\nThe participation of different vegetation types within the physical climate system is investigated using a coupled atmosphere-biosphere model, CCM3-IBIS. We analyze the effects that six different vegetation biomes (tropical, boreal, and temperate forests, savanna, grassland and steppe, and shrubland/tundra) have on the climate through their role in modulating the biophysical exchanges of energy, water, and momentum between the land-surface and the atmosphere. Using CCM3-IBIS we completely remove the vegetation cover of a particular biome and compare it to a control simulation where the biome is present, thereby isolating the climatic effects of each biome. Results from the tropical and boreal forest removal simulations are in agreement with previous studies while the other simulations provide new evidence as to their contribution in forcing the climate. Removal of the temperate forest vegetation exhibits behavior characteristic of both the tropical and boreal simulations with cooling during winter and spring due to an increase in the surface albedo and warming during the summer caused by a reduction in latent cooling. Removal of the savanna vegetation exhibits behavior much like the tropical forest simulation while removal of the grassland and steppe vegetation has the largest effect over the central United States with warming and drying of the atmosphere in summer. The largest climatic effect of shrubland and tundra vegetation removal occurs in DJF in Australia and central Siberia and is due to reduced latent cooling and enhanced cold air advection, respectively. Our results show that removal of the boreal forest yields the largest temperature signal globally when either including or excluding the areas of forest removal. Globally, precipitation is most affected by removal of the savanna vegetation when including the areas of vegetation removal, while removal of the tropical forest most influences the global precipitation excluding the areas of vegetation removal.'

Abstract: 'The \xe2\x80\x98Nidularioid Complex\xe2\x80\x99 is a group within the Bromelioideae usually characterized by inflorescences nested within water-impounding foliar rosettes. Currently, it comprises six genera: Canistrum, Canistropsis, Edmundoa, Neoregelia, Nidularium, and Wittrockia. While most of these genera occur in eastern Brazil, the distribution of Neoregelia is disjunct between the Atlantic Rainforest and Amazonia. Previous phylogenetic studies have not addressed the monophyly of and relationships among these genera; therefore, we undertook a phylogenetic study of the Nidularioid Complex with emphasis on the genus Neoregelia and its subgenera. A parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis with 101 morphological characters retrieved the Nidularioid Complex as non-monophyletic. Nidularium and Edmundoa were monophyletic. Neoregelia was recovered as non-monophyletic due to the inclusion within it of the Amazonian subgenus Hylaeaicum. These results highlight the need for revision of the generic classification of Bromelioideae, pending increased sampling of taxa and characters.'

Abstract: 'It has been shown that with careful grazing management and addition of Pand K, but not N, fertilisers Brachiaria pastures are ableto maintain sustainable live weight gains over many years. However, standardon-farm practice, which generally involves high stocking rates, leads after afew years to pasture decline due mainly to N deficiency for grass regrowth. Togenerate an understanding of the mechanism of pasture decline and possiblemanagement options to mitigate this process, a study was performed in theAtlantic forest region of the south of Bahia state to study the N dynamics inpastures of Brachiaria humidicola subject to threedifferent stocking rates of beef cattle, with and without the presence of theforage legume Desmodium ovalifolium. Despite the fact thatthe C:N ratio of the deposited litter was high (60 to 70) the rate ofdecomposition was very rapid (k \xe2\x88\xbc \xe2\x88\x920.07 gg\xe2\x88\x921 day\xe2\x88\x921) and annual rates of Nturnover through the litter pathway were between 105 and 170 kg Nha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921. In the grass-onlypasturesas stocking rate increased from 2 to 3 head ha\xe2\x88\x921, N recycledinthe litter decreased by 11%, but a further increase to 4 headha\xe2\x88\x921 decreased N recycling by 30% suggesting thatbeyonda certain critical level higher grazing stocking rates would lead to pasturedecline if there was no N addition. High stocking rates decreased theproportionof the legume in the sward, but at all rates the concentration of N in both thegreen and dead grass in the forage on offer and in the litter was higher in themixed sward. The presence of the legume caused a decrease in the C:N ratio ofthe microbial biomass while both soil N mineralisation and nitrificationincreased. This increased rate of turnover of the microbial biomass and thecontribution of N2 fixation to the legume resulted in largeincreasesin the N recycled via litter deposition ranging from 42 to 155 kg Nha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921.'

Abstract: 'Of the twelve species ofChamaedorea palm recorded for Belize, three are of international economic value because their cut leaves (xat\xc3\xa9) are traded in the floricultural industry. Traditionally, Belize has not harvested xat\xc3\xa9, the industry being based in Mexico and Guatemala. However, a decline in wild xat\xc3\xa9 stocks in these countries means Guatemalan leaf harvesters now illegally harvest xat\xc3\xa9 in Belize. To assess the local abundance of the BelizeanChamaedorea resource, its economic value, and the extent to which it has been illegally harvested, 209 plots measuring 20 meters (m) by 20 m were established in the Greater Maya Mountains (GMM) in western Belize, which includes the Chiquibul Forest Reserve (CFR). We estimate that 37.8 million leaves with a value of U.S. $0.3 million to xateros have been extracted from the CFR. The standing export value is calculated as U.S. $1.8 million for the CFR and U.S. $5 million for the GMM.'

Abstract: 'Late Holocene vegetation, fire, climate and upper forest line dynamics were studied based on detailed pollen and charcoal analyses. Two sediment cores, from the Rabadilla de Vaca mire (RVM) and the Valle Peque\xc3\xb1o bog (VP), with an age of about 2100 and 1630\xc2\xa0cal\xc2\xa0yrs b.p., respectively, were taken at the modern upper forest line in the Parque Nacional Podocarpus (Podocarpus National Park) in southeastern Ecuador. The two pollen records reflect relatively stable vegetation with slight changes in floral composition during the recorded period. Changes of the proportion between subp\xc3\xa1ramo and p\xc3\xa1ramo vegetation are related to lower and higher frequency of fires. The RVM records show that the upper forest line moved to a higher elevation between 1630 and 880\xc2\xa0cal\xc2\xa0yrs b.p., stabilising after 310\xc2\xa0cal yrs b.p. Human impact is suggested by a high fire frequency, mainly between 1800\xe2\x80\x931600 and 880\xe2\x80\x93310\xc2\xa0cal yrs b.p. The VP records indicate no marked changes in the upper forest line. The charcoal records suggest an increased human impact from 230\xc2\xa0cal yrs b.p. to the present. The results indicate that high fire frequency is an important factor in reducing the expansion of subp\xc3\xa1ramo vegetation and upper montane rainforest and in favouring the distribution of grass p\xc3\xa1ramo. Since there is a clear correlation between fire and vegetation dynamics, it is difficult to detect how far climate change also played a significant role in upper forest line changes during the late Holocene.'

Abstract: 'A lake sediment record from Laguna Campana at 2,488\xc2\xa0m a.s.l. in the eastern Ecuadorian Andes allows the reconstruction of local environmental conditions over the past ~500\xc2\xa0years. A high-resolution multi-proxy approach using pollen, spore, charcoal and XRF analyses provides information about lake genesis, hydrological variations and the development of the surrounding vegetation. Results suggest that Laguna Campana originated from a landslide, which are naturally common and anthropogenically promoted in the study area. Human activities, e.g. deforestation or slash and burn cultivation, impacted the local vegetation development and biodiversity during the recorded period. After a first dense layer of pioneer grasses developed on open soil around the small lake, successional stages of secondary upper mountain rainforest forest mainly composed of Alnus and Weinmannia were observed. The record shows no signs of dense forest regeneration but rather open vegetation with trees and a grassy understory. Especially since ca. a.d. 1980, the proportion of forest in the area was reduced, most probably by fire use for pastures, cultivation and wood extraction. Hydrological variability was derived from differences in minerogenic input and variations in Botryococcus braunii and Sphagnum occurrence. After wettest conditions at the study site, probably triggering the landslide, humid conditions persisted until a time of drier conditions between a.d. 1900 and 1960. A subsequent return to wetter conditions was observed over the last decades. XRF analyses suggest an increase in deposition of atmospherically derived lead since the formation of the lake.'

Abstract: 'The nature of the warm climates of the Cretaceous has been enigmatic since the first numerical climate models were run in the late 1970s. Quantitative simulations of the paleoclimate have consistently failed to agree with information from plant and animal fossils and climate sensitive sediments. The \xe2\x80\x98cold continental interior paradox\xe2\x80\x99 (first described by DeConto et al. in Barrera E, Johnson C (eds) Evolution of the Cretaceous Ocean/climate system, vol 332.

We reconsider the paleoelevations of specific areas, particularly along the northeastern Siberian continental margin, where paleofloras indeed indicate higher temperatures than suggested by current climate models. Evidence for significant masses of ice on land during even the otherwise warmest times of the Cretaceous is solved by reinterpretation of the \xce\xb418O record of fossil plankton. The signal interpreted as an increase in ice volume on land is the same as the signal for an increase in the volume of groundwater reservoirs on land. The problem of a warm Arctic, where fossil floras indicate that they never experienced freezing conditions in winter, could not be solved by numerical simulations using higher CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas concentrations. We propose a solution by assuming that paleoelevations were less than today and that there were much more extensive wetlands (lakes, meandering rivers, swamps, bogs) on the continents than previously assumed.

Abstract: 'Large, multinational resource development projects can affectmany aspects, including social, economic and ecological realities, in the regions where they operate. Social and environmental issues that are usually ignored in such projectsare increasingly affecting the financial future of multinationalcorporations in negative ways. In this article, we advance the argument that corporations can successfully manage these issuesand that if they choose to view these management efforts as an investment rather than an expense, they may well acquire a competitive advantage over companies that do not. We describe asa case study the Camisea natural gas and condensates developmentproject in Peru, operated by Shell Prospecting and Development Peru (SPDP). Camisea is one of the first projects anywhere inthe world to conduct a detailed analysis of key industry-relatedsocial issues and the processes, required investment and financial impact of managing them. The Camisea example supportsthe argument that addressing social and environmental concerns makes financial sense. In present value terms, the benefit ofmanaging these concerns was expected to surpass the cost investment by approximately US$50 million.'

Abstract: ' The leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most critical variables describing the biophysical and biochemical properties of the land cover in the remote sensing and climate models. In this study, the climatological variations of LAI is analyzed with NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s 14-year (1981\xe2\x80\x931994) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) measurements. More attention is given to the 14 months of Julys or the warm seasons, in which interannual LAI variations contain more pronounced signals of dynamic forcing associated with the tropical rainforests and the temperate forests around 60\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x89N. Furthermore, projecting the LAI anomalies into the empirical orthogonal function time series of El Ni\xc3\xb1o and other climatologically important events shows that the large-scale circulations play an important role in determining the interannual variations of LAI, likely through the changes of surface insolation, precipitation and soil moisture. It is found that on the global scale LAI and the land surface and skin temperatures are negatively correlated, namely, decreasing LAI corresponds to warm temperatures. However, the regional LAI effects on the land surface climate vary significantly from regions to regions.'

Abstract: 'Attention is drawn to the relatively low number of Ipomoea species found in the Amazon basin as well as to the rarity of most species restricted to the region. Six new species from the Amazonian periphery are described: Ipomoea acrensis J. R. I. Wood & Scotland and I. altoamazonica J. R. I. Wood & Scotland from Brazil and Peru, I. maranyonensis J. R. I. Wood & Scotland from Peru, I. macarenaensis J. R. I. Wood & Scotland from Colombia, I. pogonocalyx J. R. I. Wood & Scotland from Brazil and I. deminuta J. R. I. Wood & Scotland from Bolivia. Variation in I. megapotamica is discussed and two subspecies are recognised, subsp. megapotamica from southern South America and subsp. velutina J. R. I. Wood & Scotland from northern Brazil and Venezuela. Plants treated as I. chenopodiifolia M. Martens & Galeotti from Venezuela are recognised as I. retropilosa (Pittier) D. F. Austin. Two subspecies of this species are proposed, subsp. retropilosa being endemic to the Venezuelan Andes whereas the newly described subsp. cundinamarcana J. R. I. Wood & Scotland is restricted to Colombia. I. austinii Infante-Bet. is treated as a synonym of the African I. involucrata P. Beauv., one of a number of Old World species now established in the neotropics.'

Abstract: 'The Pantanal floodplain of southwestern Brazil, with its mosaic of marshes,seasonally flooded savannas, woodlands and forests, is known as one of thewildlife hotspots of South America. The region harbors a rich mammal fauna andis a stronghold for a number of mammal species; however, still very few thoroughmammal surveys have been conducted in the Pantanal. This is the first mammalsurvey from the southeastern part of the region. An intensive,three-month study of the medium to large, non-volant species wasconducted at a location in the upper Rio Negro Basin, Aquidauana region, MatoGrosso do Sul. Thirty species of mammals were recorded, including 5 xenarthrans,1 primate, 10 carnivores, 7 ungulates and 5 caviomorph rodents. It was possibleto analyze the field biology of many of the species to a level not previouslypublished for the Pantanal. Recommendations are given for camera trapping in thePantanal and the Amazon. Finally, the effects of intensive cattle ranching onconservation in the Pantanal are discussed.'

Abstract: 'The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) published in 2007 presents the most complete and authoritative assessment of the status of scientific knowledge on all aspects of climate change. This paper presents an updated assessment of the risks from anthropogenic climate change, based on a comprehensive review of the pertinent scientific literature published since finalisation of the AR4. Many risks are now assessed as stronger than in the AR4, including the risk of large sea-level rise already in the current century, the amplification of global warming due to biological and geological carbon-cycle feedbacks, a large magnitude of \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted warming\xe2\x80\x9d currently concealed by a strong aerosol mask, substantial increases in climate variability and extreme weather events, and the risks to marine ecosystems from climate change and ocean acidification. Some topics remain the subject of intense scientific debate, such as past and future changes in tropical cyclone activity and the risk of large-scale Amazon forest dieback. The rise in greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations has accelerated recently, and it is expected to accelerate further in the absence of targeted policy interventions. Taken together, these findings point to an increased urgency of implementing mitigation policies as well as comprehensive and equitable adaptation policies.'

Abstract: 'Industrial utilization of the vast wild vegetable resources of Latin America involves much more than the solution of technological problems. More difficult, at times, are the problems of labor, politics, transportation, native apathy and climate.'

Abstract: 'A recent debate in ecological anthropology concerns the availability of wild foods for human foragers in tropical forests. This article is a response to the five essays in this same issue of Human Ecology that examine the hypothesis that hunter-gatherers could never have lived in tropical rain forest without direct or indirect access to cultivated foods. We clarify the hypothesis and assess the evidence offered to date. Archeological evidence suggests foraging without cultivation in Malaysia. We propose a program of ecological studies and archeological research which, if undertaken, should provide the evidence necessary to falsify the hypothesis.'

Abstract: 'A better understanding of the relationship between the El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the climatic anomalies it engenders, and malaria epidemics could help mitigate the world-wide increase in incidence of this mosquito-transmitted disease. The purpose of this paper is to assess the possibility of using ENSO forecasts for improving malaria control. This paper analyses the relationship between ENSO events and malaria epidemics in a number of South American countries (Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela). A statistically significant relationship was found between El Ni\xc3\xb1o and malaria epidemics in Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Venezuela. We demonstrate that flooding engenders malaria epidemics in the dry coastal region of northern Peru, while droughts favor the development of epidemics in Colombia and Guyana, and epidemics lag a drought by 1 year in Venezuela. In Brazil, French Guiana, and Ecuador, where we did not detect an ENSO/malaria signal, non-climatic factors such as insecticide sprayings, variation in availability of anti-malaria drugs, and population migration are likely to play a stronger role in malaria epidemics than ENSO-generated climatic anomalies. In some South American countries, El Ni\xc3\xb1o forecasts show strong potential for informing public health efforts to control malaria.'

Abstract: 'As part of the preparation for the Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia, a meso-scale modelling study was executed to highlight deficiencies in the current understanding of land surface atmosphere interaction at local to sub-continental scales in the dry season. Meso-scale models were run in 1-D and 3-D mode for the area of Rondonia State, Brazil. The important conclusions are that without calibration it is difficult to model the energy partitioning of pasture; modelling that of forest is easier due to the absence of a strong moisture deficit signal. The simulation of the boundary layer above forest is good, above deforested areas (pasture) poor. The models\xe2\x80\x99 underestimate of the temperature of the boundary layer is likely to be caused by the neglect of the radiative effects of aerosols caused by biomass burning, but other factors such as lack of sufficient entrainment in the model at the mixed layer top may also contribute. The Andes generate patterns of subsidence and gravity waves, the effects of which are felt far into the Rondonian area The results show that the picture presented by GCM modelling studies may need to be balanced by an increased understanding of what happens at the meso-scale. The results are used to identify key measurements for the LBA atmospheric meso-scale campaign needed to improve the model simulations. Similar modelling studies are proposed for the wet season in Rondonia, when convection plays a major role.'

Abstract: 'The use of herbarium specimens as vouchers to support ethnobotanical surveys is well established. However, herbaria may be underutilized resources for ethnobotanical research that depends on the analysis of large datasets compiled across multiple sites. Here, we compare two medicinal use datasets, one sourced from published papers and the other from online herbaria to determine whether herbarium and published data are comparable and to what extent herbarium specimens add new data and fill gaps in our knowledge of geographical extent of plant use. Using Brazilian legumes as a case study, we compiled 1400 use reports from 105 publications and 15 Brazilian herbaria. Of the 319 species in 107 genera with cited medicinal uses, 165 (51%) were recorded only in the literature and 55 (17%) only on herbarium labels. Mode of application, plant part used, or therapeutic use was less often documented by herbarium specimen labels (17% with information) than publications (70%). However, medicinal use of 21 of the 128 species known from only one report in the literature was substantiated from independently collected herbarium specimens, and 58 new therapeutic applications, 25 new plant parts, and 16 new modes of application were added for species known from the literature. Thus, when literature reports are few or information-poor, herbarium data can both validate and augment these reports. Herbarium data can also provide insights into the history and geographical extent of use that are not captured in publications.'

Abstract: 'To assess the impacts of land-use changes on plant-available water (PAW) and evapotranspiration (ET), volumetric water content (VWC) was measured to 8 m beneath three, adjacent ecosystems for four years (1991\xe2\x80\x931994). Estimates of PAW, ET, and deep drainage were generated for mature evergreen forest, adjacent pasture, and capoeira (second-growth forest on abandoned pasture land). PAW between 0 and 8 m depth for forest, pasture, and capoeira ranged from a low of 56, 400, and 138 mm at the end of the 1992 dry season to a high of 941, 1116, and 1021 mm during the 1994 wet season. We found significant differences in deep (4\xe2\x80\x938 m) stocks of PAW when comparing pasture with both forest types. In contrast, mature forest and capoeira PAW were not significantly different from one another at any depth during the experiment. In all three ecosystems available soil moisture from 4\xe2\x80\x938 m was depleted during the 1991 dry season by plant water uptake and was not recharged to 1991 levels until 1994 due to an intervening 2-year, El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation event. Water balance estimates (based on measurements to 8 m) showed an average 10% decrease in ET from pasture compared to mature forest. Less than 15 years after pasture abandonment, ET in second-growth forest recovered to rates nearly equaling the mature forest rate. In seasonally dry environments annual and interannual cycles of deep soil moisture recharge and depletion influence rates of transpiration and drainage. These deep cycles are not currently incorporated in models of regional and global moisture flux.'

Abstract: 'Mesophyll conductance (g m) is essential to determine accurate physiological parameters used to model photosynthesis in forest ecosystems. This study aimed to determine the effects of time of day on photosynthetic parameters, and to assess the effect of using either intercellular CO2 concentration (C i) or chloroplast CO2 concentration (C c), on maximum carboxylation velocity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), V cmax. We used Amazonian saplings of Myrcia paivae and Minquartia guianensis. Photosynthetic parameters were measured using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA); g m was determined using both gas exchange and chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence and gas-exchange data alone. Leaf thickness (L T) and specific leaf area (SLA) were also measured. Air temperature, relative humidity or understory light did not correlate with g m and on average daily IRGA-fluorometer-determined g m was 0.04 mol(CO2) m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 for M. paivae and 0.05 mol(CO2) m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 for M. guianensis. Stomatal conductance (g s), g m, electron transport rate (J F), and light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (P Nmax) were lower in the afternoon than in the morning. However, no effect of time of day was observed on V cmax. L T and SLA did not affect any of the examined parameters. IRGA-determined g m was almost the double of the value obtained using the IRGA-fluorescence method. V cmax values determined using C c were about 25% higher than those obtained using C i, which highlighted the importance of using C c in V cmax calculation. Decline in P Nmax at the end of the afternoon reflected variations in g s and g m rather than changes in V cmax. Diurnal variation in g m appeared to be associated more with endogenous than with atmospheric factors.'

Abstract: ' Deep rooted vegetation (of up to 68\xe2\x80\x89m) has been found in many parts of the tropics. However, models of the general atmospheric circulation (GCMs) typically use rooting depths of less than 2\xe2\x80\x89m in their land surface parametrizations. How does the incorporation of deep roots into such a model affect the simulated climate? We assess this question by using a GCM and find that deeper roots lead to a pronounced seasonal response. During the dry season, evapotranspiration and the associated latent heat flux are considerably increased over large regions leading to a cooling of up to 8\xe2\x80\x89K. The enhanced atmospheric moisture is transported towards the main convection areas in the inner tropical convergence zone where it supplies more energy to convection thus intensifying the tropical circulation patterns. Comparison to different kinds of data reveals that the simulation with deeper roots is much closer to observations. The inclusion of deep roots also leads to a general increased climatic sensitivity to rooting depth change. We investigate this aspect in the context of the climatic effects of large-scale deforestation in Amazonia. Most of the regional and remote changes can be attributed to the removal of deep roots. We conclude that deep rooted vegetation is an important part of the tropical climate system. Without the consideration of deep roots, the present-day surface climate cannot adequately be simulated.'

Abstract: 'We analysed karyotypes of five taxa of the rodent generaOecomys andNectomys, trapped in 14 localities in an area ranging from 8\xc2\xb0 to 29\xc2\xb0S on Brazilian territory.Oecomys cf.concolor, collected in the Amazon and in two localities of the Cerrado biome, showed a 2n=60 karyotype constituted by a pair of large subtelocentric chromosomes, a small metacentric pair and 27 acrocentric pairs. The X chromosome was a large submetacentric and a subtelo-submetacentric, the morphology of the latter showing variable C-banding patterns. In all three localities the Y chromosome was a medium size heterochromatic acrocentric. Two individuals from the Cerrado had a heterochromatic acrocentric B-chromosome.Oecomys cf.bicolor presented two cytotypes, 2n=80 in the specimens from the Cerrado biome and 2n=82 in individuals trapped in the Amazon. The 2n=80 cytotype 1 showed a large subtelocentric, 22 biarmed pairs (medium to small) and 16 acrocentric autosomal pairs. The karyotype of the 2n=82 cytotype 2 is constituted by 15 biarmed chromosomes (median to small) and 25 acrocentric pairs with heterochromatic blocks at pericentromeric regions. The sexual pairs were the same (large submetacentric X and median acrocentric Y) in both cytotypes. InO. cf.concolor and in both cytotypes ofO. cf.bicolor the nucleolar organizer regions were observed in 1-3 pairs, located in the short arms.Nectomys genus presented two cytotypes, 2n=52\xe2\x80\x9355 (N. rattus, with 0\xe2\x80\x933 biarmed heterochromatic accessory chromosomes) and 2n=56\xe2\x80\x9359 (N. squamipes, bearing 0\xe2\x80\x933 biarmed, heterochromatic, B-chromosomes). These 2 cytotypes occupy disjunct regions of South America, with overlapping areas in the Brazilian states of Pernambuco, Bahia, and Mato Grosso do Sul.'

Abstract: 'The native cacao trees (Theobroma cacao L.) in south-eastern French Guiana represent a noteworthy fraction of the genetic diversity of this species. Several scientific surveys have led to the collection of numerous accessions, which provides an opportunity for investigating the pattern of genetic diversity in natural populations. Using a capillary electrophoresis genotyping system, we fingerprinted 189 wild trees in 18 natural populations. Based on the 15 loci SSR profiles, we analyzed the intra- and inter-population variation and their relationship with control clones. The global allelic richness was 4.87 alleles per locus, but was 2.4 on average within individual populations; gene diversity was 0.368 and observed heterozygosity was low (0.160). Major structuring was discovered in the metapopulation of French Guianan wild cacao trees (Fst = 0.20), which could be explained by the biological characteristics of the cacao tree and the climatic events that affected the Guianan forests in the Quaternary period.'

Abstract: 'People influence their environments through the manipulation of landscapes and species. Human influence on the landscape may lead to the development of differentiated landscape units that originate from past use and may be related to the presence of certain species. This study investigated the presence of the palm Euterpe edulis and its current and past importance in landscape units established by a community of German descendants located in southern Brazil. The objectives of this study were to characterize the use of the species, to identify the importance of E.edulis for the German immigrant community, to identify past and current uses of E.edulis, to describe the historical use of the landscape, and lastly, to identify landscape units in which E.edulis is found.'

Abstract: 'Patterns of both above- and belowground biomass and production were evaluated using published information from 200 individual data-sets. Data sets were comprised of the following types of information: organic matter storage in living and dead biomass (e.g. surface organic horizons and soil organic matter accumulations), above- and belowground net primary production (NPP) and biomass, litter transfers, climatic data (i.e. precipitation and temperature), and nutrient storage (N, P, Ca, K) in above- and belowground biomass, soil organic matter and litter transfers. Forests were grouped by climate, foliage life-span, species and soil order. Several climatic and nutrient variables were regressed against fine root biomass or net primary production to determine what variables were most useful in predicting their dynamics. There were no significant or consistent patterns for above- and belowground biomass accumulation or NPP change across the different climatic forest types and by soil order. Similarly, there were no consistent patterns of soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation by climatic forest type but SOM varied significantly by soil order\xe2\x80\x94the chemistry of the soil was more important in determining the amount of organic matter accumulation than climate. Soil orders which were high in aluminum, iron, and clay (e.g. Ultisols, Oxisols) had high total living and dead organic matter accumulations-especially in the cold temperate zone and in the tropics. Climatic variables and nutrient storage pools (i.e. in the forest floor) successfully predicted fine root NPP but not fine root biomass which was better predicted by nutrients in litterfall. The importance of grouping information by species based on their adaptive strategies for water and nutrient-use is suggested by the data. Some species groups did not appear to be sensitive to large changes in either climatic or nutrient variables while for others these variables explained a large proportion of the variation in fine root biomass and/or NPP.'

Abstract: 'We used fossil pollen to investigate the response of the eastern Chiquitano seasonally-dry tropical forest (SDTF), lowland Bolivia, to high-amplitude climate change associated with glacial\xe2\x80\x93interglacial cycles. Changes in the structure, composition and diversity of the past vegetation are compared with palaeoclimate data previously reconstructed from the same record, and these results shed light on the biogeographic history of today\xe2\x80\x99s highly disjunct blocks of SDTF across South America. We demonstrate that lower glacial temperatures limited tropical forest in the Chiquitan\xc3\xada region, and suggest that SDTF was absent or restricted at latitudes below 17\xc2\xb0S, the proposed location of the majority of the hypothesized \xe2\x80\x98Pleistocene dry forest arc\xe2\x80\x99 (PDFA). At 19500\xc2\xa0yrs b.p., warming supported the establishment of a floristically-distinct SDTF, which showed little change throughout the glacial\xe2\x80\x93Holocene transition, despite a shift to significantly wetter conditions beginning ca. 12500\xe2\x80\x9312200\xc2\xa0yrs b.p. Anadenanthera colubrina, a key SDTF taxon, arrived at 10000\xc2\xa0yrs b.p., which coincides with the onset of drought associated with an extended dry season. Lasting until 3000\xc2\xa0yrs b.p., Holocene drought caused a floristic shift to more drought-tolerant taxa and a reduction in \xce\xb1-diversity (shown by declining palynological richness), but closed-canopy forest was maintained throughout. In contrast to the PDFA, the modern distribution of SDTF most likely represents the greatest spatial coverage of these forests in southern South America since glacial times. We find that temperature is a key climatic control upon the distribution of lowland South American SDTF over glacial-interglacial timescales, and seasonality of rainfall exerts a strong control on their floristic composition.'

Abstract: 'The dense tropical forests of the Amazon today support an extraordinarily high biodiversity of mammals, consisting of a dozen orders and more than 500 endemic species (Emmons 1997). The sources and antiquity of this amazing biodiversity, however, are very poorly known. Whereas the fossil record elsewhere in South America has improved significantly from new field discoveries over the past several decades (Flynn and Wyss 1998; MacFadden 2006), the Amazon remains essentially terra incognita before the Pleistocene. There are several reasons why our knowledge of this important region has lagged behind elsewhere. The relatively flat topography of the Amazon basin is not prone to extensive vertical exposures of sediments, like those where paleontologists normally find fossils. The dense vegetative ground cover obscures sedimentary deposits potentially containing fossils. Likewise, the lack of access into the tropical rainforest and otherwise inhospitable conditions for paleontological field work have together conspired against the kinds of fossil discoveries that might advance our understanding of the ancient mammalian biodiversity of this region.'

Abstract: ' Rainfall partitioning into throughfall and stemflow was studied in a diverse and in a mono specific stand of secondary vegetation in Eastern Amazonia. The nutrient concentrations in the water were analysed in order to quantify the related hydrochemical fluxes. Secondary vegetation forms the fallow in the local shifting cultivation system and is usually dominated by shrubs and trees. Phenakospermum guyannense (Strelitziaceae), a banana-like herb, is one of the predominant non-woody species. The study was conducted during an 18-month period in a 2.5-year-old relatively species-rich stand and a 10-year-old stand dominated by P. guyannense. In a year with 1956\xe2\x80\x89mm of rainfall 65% (1281\xe2\x80\x89mm) of this quantity reached the soil as throughfall in the diverse stand and 38% (743\xe2\x80\x89mm) in the mono specific stand. Stemflow was estimated to be 23% and 41% respectively. P. guyannense and Banara guianensis (Flacourtiaceae), a tree species, were causing these high funnelling effects. In the young diverse stand B. guianensis had a stemflow of more than 200\xe2\x80\x89l year\xe2\x88\x921 and P. guyannense had a median flux of 77\xe2\x80\x89l year\xe2\x88\x921 per pseudostem. In the older stand the taller plants of P.\xe2\x90\xa3guyannense collected 644\xe2\x80\x89l year\xe2\x88\x921 per pseudostem on the median. The reason for these high values could be the banana-like growth form of P. guyannense and the crown morphology of B. guianensis, which has inclined branches. The low proportion of throughfall and the high stemflow values differ from all previous studies in Amazonian primary forests. The proximity to the Atlantic Ocean strongly influenced the nutrient fluxes via rainfall at our study site. This becomes obvious from the high Na and Cl fluxes with rainfall (19.7\xe2\x80\x89kg Na ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921, 37.2\xe2\x80\x89kg Cl ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921) which were approximately equal to the Na and Cl fluxes with the sum of throughfall and stemflow for both stands. K fluxes in throughfall and stemflow in both stands were higher than in rainfall by a factor of 8. The high K enrichment during the crown passage is assumed to be caused by a\xe2\x90\xa3high K concentration in the leaf tissue resulting in enhanced leaching from the leaves. In months with low\xe2\x90\xa3rainfall the concentrations of Ca, Mg, S and Cl in throughfall of the diverse stand were significantly higher than in months with high rainfall. This was mainly due to vegetation burns in the dry period, which resulted in ash deposition on the canopy and subsequent wash-off and solution of ash particles.'

Abstract: 'Studies of the impact of traditional agroforestry practices on soil nutrient status in the Amazon Basin have largely been limited to upland sites, many of which are oligotrophic. However, rural population density in Amazonia is highest on the floodplains of the major rivers and shifting cultivation has been practiced on the floodplains for millennia. We established a slash-and-burn cultivation plot and an untreated forest plot in tidal floodplain successional forest in the Islands of Abaetetuba, Par\xc3\xa1, Brazil, and sampled soils (0\xe2\x80\x9310 cm) during four phases of the agroforest cycle (n = 9 in each plot for each sampling period): (1) prior to clearing, (2) following burning, (3) harvest one (rice at four months), and (4) harvest two (sugar cane at 15 months). During the course of this pilot experiment, background temporal variability in SOC, total N and available mineral nutrient pools (P, K, Ca, Mg) exceeded treatment effects, suggesting that soil nutrient pools in this environment are well-buffered against the effects of shifting cultivation. These results contrast markedly with those reported for Amazonian upland sites where nutrient pulses and declines associated with the agroforest cycle have been demonstrated and may restrict the potential for low-input, continuous cultivation. Physical limitations imposed by flooding and fluvial erosion, rather than nutrient constraints, restrict the potential of agricultural intensification in the tidal floodplains.'

Abstract: 'Malaria control in South America has vastly improved in the past decade, leading to a decrease in the malaria burden. Despite the progress, large parts of the continent continue to be at risk of malaria transmission, especially in northern South America. The objectives of this study were to assess the risk of malaria transmission and vector exposure in northern South America using multi-criteria decision analysis.'

Abstract: 'The phylogenetic community assembly approach has been used to elucidate the role of ecological and historical processes in shaping tropical tree communities. Recent studies have shown that stressful environments, such as seasonally dry, white-sand and flooded forests tend to be phylogenetically clustered, arguing for niche conservatism as the main driver for this pattern. Very few studies have attempted to identify the lineages that contribute to such assembly patterns. We aimed to improve our understanding of the assembly of flooded forest tree communities in Northern South America by asking the following questions: are seasonally flooded forests phylogenetically clustered? If so, which angiosperm lineages are over-represented in seasonally flooded forests? To assess our hypotheses, we investigated seasonally flooded and terra firme forests from the Magdalena, Orinoco and Amazon Basins, in Colombia. Our results show that, regardless of the river basin in which they are located, seasonally flooded forests of Northern South America tend to be phylogenetically clustered, which means that the more abundant taxa in these forests are more closely related to each other than expected by chance. Based on our alpha and beta phylodiversity analyses we interpret that eudicots are more likely to adapt to extreme environments such as seasonally flooded forests, which indicates the importance of environmental filtering in the assembly of the Neotropical flora.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests still cover almost 8 million km2 of the humid tropics. But they are being destroyed at ever-more rapid rates. In 1989 the area deforested amounted to 142 200 km2, or nearly 90% more than in 1979. So whereas the 1989 total amounted to 1.8% of the remaining biome, the proportion could well continue to rise for the foreseeable future, until there is little forest left in just another few decades.'

Abstract: 'Until recently, Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787) was considered to represent a single tick species in the New World. Recent studies have split this taxon into six species. While the A. cajennense species complex or A. cajennense (sensu lato) (s.l.) is currently represented by two species in Brazil, A. cajennense (sensu stricto) (s.s.) and Amblyomma sculptum Berlese, 1888, their geographical distribution is poorly known.

Abstract: 'We assessed the rainwater chemistry, the potential sources of its main inorganic components and bulk atmospheric deposition in a rural tropical semiarid region in the Brazilian Caatinga. Rainfall samples were collected during two wet seasons, one during an extremely dry year (2012) and one during a year with normal rainfall (2013). According to measurements of the main inorganic ions in the rainwater (H+, Na+, NH4 +, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl\xe2\x88\x92, NO3 \xe2\x88\x92, and SO4 2\xe2\x88\x92), no differences were observed in the total ionic charge between the two investigated wet seasons. However, Ca2+, K+, NH4 + and NO3 \xe2\x88\x92 were significant higher in the wetter year (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) which was attributed to anthropogenic activities, such as organic fertilizer applications. The total ionic contents of the rainwater suggested a dominant marine contribution, accounting for 76\xc2\xa0% and 58\xc2\xa0% of the rainwater in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The sum of the non-sea-salt fractions of Cl\xe2\x88\x92, SO4 2\xe2\x88\x92, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ were 19\xc2\xa0% and 33\xc2\xa0% in 2012 and 2013, and the nitrogenous compounds accounted for 2.8\xc2\xa0% and 6.0\xc2\xa0% of the total ionic contents in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The ionic ratios suggested that Mg2+ was probably the main neutralizing constituent of rainwater acidity, followed by Ca2+. We observed a low bulk atmospheric deposition of all major rainwater ions during both wet seasons. Regarding nitrogen deposition, we estimated slightly lower annual inputs than previous global estimates. Our findings contribute to the understanding of rainfall chemistry in northeastern Brazil by providing baseline information for a previously unstudied tropical semiarid ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Two years of eddy covariance measurements of above-and below-canopy carbon fluxes and static opaque chamber and gas chromatography technique measurements of soil respiration for three treatments (bare soil, soil+litterfall, soil+litterfall+seedling) were carried out in a tropical seasonal rain forest. In addition, data of photosynthesis of dominant tree species and seedlings, leaf area index, litter production and decomposing speed, soil moisture, soil temperature and photosynthetic photon flux density within the forest were all measured concurrently. Data from January 2003 to December 2004 are used to present annual variability of carbon flux and relationships between carbon flux and impact factors. The results show that carbon flux of this forest presented unusual tendency of annual variation; above-canopy carbon fluxes were negative in the dry season (November\xe2\x80\x93April) and mainly positive in the rainy season, but overall the forest is a carbon sink. Carbon flux has obviously diurnal variation in this tropical seasonal rain forest. Above-canopy carbon fluxes were negative in the day-time and absolute values were larger in the dry season than that in the rainy season, causing the forest to act as a carbon sink; at night, carbon fluxes were mainly positive, causing the forest to act as a carbon source. Dominant tree species have greater photosynthesis capability than that of seedlings, which have a great effect on above-canopy carbon flux. There was a significant correlation between above-canopy carbon flux and rate of photosynthesis of tree species. There was also a significant correlation between above-canopy carbon flux and rate of photosynthesis of seedlings; however, the below-canopy carbon flux was only significantly correlated with rate of photosynthesis of seedlings during the hot-dry season. Soil respiration of the three treatments displayed a markedly seasonal dynamic; in addition, above-canopy carbon fluxes correlated well with soil respiration, litterfall pro-duction, litterfall decomposition rate, precipitation, and soil moisture and temperature. A primary sta-tistical result of this study showed that above-canopy carbon flux in this forest presented carbon source or sink effects in different seasons, and it is a carbon sink at the scale of a year.'

Abstract: 'This study aims to ascertain habitat utilization, in relation to forest structural variation, by a multi-species group of primates in tropical lowland rainforest in Southeast Peru during dry season. A new approach to assessing habitat utilization was used. Habitat variation was described by structural and indicator variables collected in quadrats along transects through a study area within Terra Firme and Floodplain forest. Variables were grouped into \xe2\x80\x98factors\xe2\x80\x99 accounting for most of the variation by means of a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Presence or absence of the primates within the quadrats, assessed by repeat transect surveys, was taken to indicate habitat preferences. Discrimination between the habitat and forest structure in areas of primate presence as opposed to absence was carried out by means of Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA). This highlighted patterns in most utilized habitat. Vertical utilization of the forest was also assessed along with presence in bamboo and general activity on encounter. Suggestions of habitat preference and utilization are made for each of the six sympatric species studied, based on significantly discriminating habitat factors, vertical stratification on encounter and relationships with bamboo.Saguinus fuscicollis andCebus moloch appeared as habitat generalists.Cebus apella, Saimiri sciureus, andAotus spp., exhibited varying degrees of preference for habitat factors suggesting disturbed forest,Cebus albifrons was more generalistic but with a possible association with primary, naturally disturbed forest.C. appella was encountered in Terra Firme forest significantly more than in Floodplain. ForS. sciureus, C. moloch, andC. apella, upper understory was the most utilized forest layer, forC. albifrons, middle canopy and forS. sciureus andAotus spp., lower understory. Both positive and negative relationships with bamboo were highlighted. Significant positive relationships betweenAotus spp., and bamboo suggest dense bamboo stands provide important daytime resting sites for this nocturnal species.C. moloch was also shown to utilize bamboo whereasS. fuscicollis appeared to actively avoid it. High levels of conformity with past studies in terms of habitat utilization patterns described for the species studied supports the conclusion that the methods used in this study provide an effective means of assessing primate habitat utilization within complex habitat.'

Abstract: 'We are pleased to introduce this special issue of the Journal of Information Technology on Institutional Theory in Information Systems (IS) Research. The publication of The New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis (Powell and Dimaggio, 1991) and Institutions and Organization (Scott, 2001) were significant contributions to the renaissance in the study of institutions in the social sciences (Dimaggio and Powell, 1991). These influential books remind us that institutionalism is a highly complex field, where work is delineated across core disciplines, including economics, sociology, political science, history and ecology. To add to the complexity and richness of the theory, contributions have been divided into time frames labelled the \xe2\x80\x98old\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98new\xe2\x80\x99 institutionalism (Greenwood et al., 2008).

Abstract: 'The characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as well as the concentrations and stable isotope composition (\xce\xb413C) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were characterized in several large rivers of Africa including the Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Ogoou\xc3\xa9 basins. We compared the spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality along with various environmental gradients, including hydrology, river size, catchment vegetation, and connectivity to land. The optical proxies used include the absorption coefficient at 350\xc2\xa0nm, the specific ultra-violet absorbance, and the spectral slope ratio (S R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0275\xe2\x80\x93295-nm slope divided by 350\xe2\x80\x93400-nm slope). Our results show that land cover plays a primary role in controlling both DOC concentration and optical properties of DOM in tropical freshwaters. A higher cover of dense forest in the catchment leads to a higher quantity of highly aromatic DOM in the river network, whereas an increasing savannah cover results in lower DOC concentrations and less absorptive DOM. In addition to land cover, the watershed morphology (expressed by the average slope) exerts a strong control on DOC and CDOM in tropical rivers. Our results also show that the percentage of C3 and C4 vegetation cover is not an accurate predictor for DOM and CDOM quality in rivers due to the importance of the spatial distribution of land cover within the drainage network. The comparison of our results with previously published CDOM data in temperate and high-latitude rivers highlights that DOM in tropical freshwaters is generally more aromatic, and shows a higher capacity for absorbing sunlight irradiance.'

Abstract: 'The climate change mitigation mechanism Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD+) is currently being negotiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Integrating biodiversity monitoring into REDD+ facilitates compliance with the safeguards stipulated by the UNFCCC to exclude environmental risks. Interviews with actors engaged in REDD+ implementation and biodiversity conservation at the national and sub-national level in Peru (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa030) and a literature review (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa058) were conducted to pinpoint constraints and opportunities for monitoring effects of REDD+ management interventions on biodiversity, and to identify relevant biodiversity data and indicators. It was found that particularly sub-national actors, who were frequently involved in REDD+ pilot projects, acknowledge the availability of biodiversity data. Actors at both the national and sub-national levels, however, criticized data gaps and data being scattered across biodiversity research organizations. Most of the literature reviewed (78\xc2\xa0%) included indicators on the state of certain biodiversity aspects, especially mammals. Indicators for pressure on biodiversity, impacts on environmental functions, or policy responses to environmental threats were addressed less frequently (31, 21, and 10\xc2\xa0%, respectively). Integrating biodiversity concerns in carbon monitoring schemes was considered to have potential, although few specific examples were identified. The involvement of biodiversity research organizations in sub-national REDD+ activities enhances monitoring capacities. It is discussed how improvements in collaboration among actors from the project to the national level could facilitate the evaluation of existing information at the national level. Monitoring changes in ecosystem services may increase the ecological and socioeconomic viability of REDD+.'

Abstract: 'In this paper, we tested four hypotheses relative to edge and shape effects on ant communities: (i) forest edges have lower species richness than the remnant core; (ii) species richness increases with distance from the edge; (iii) irregularly shaped remnants have lower species richness than more regular remnants; (iv) there is a higher similarity of species composition between edge and core in irregular than in regular remnants. We sampled litter ant communities on the edge and core of ten remnants, in Vi\xc3\xa7osa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Species richness was larger at the forest core than at the edges, although did not increase with distance from the edge. Species richness did not vary with shape complexity. The similarity of species composition between edge and core showed a decreasing trend with remnant area, and did not vary with shape complexity. The observed differences of species richness between forest core and edge may be due to higher harshness of edges, caused by environmental changes. The absence of relationship between species richness and distance from the edge might indicate the range of edge effects, which would be smaller than the smallest distance of core sampled. Therefore, edges would affect litter-dwelling ant species richness in a distance smaller than 50\xc2\xa0m. The observation of species composition allowed us to notice an effect of fragmentation that would not be noticed if we were considering only species richness. Edge may serve as step to generalist species, which may use it to colonise forest remnants. Furthermore, small remnants are more colonisation-prone by such species, and have a more homogeneous species composition than large remnants.'

Abstract: 'A major challenge for the future of tropical rainforests is to combine ecological conservation with sufficient economic revenue for local communities to lead a decent life, now and in the far future. This fundamental question is being addressed by the Projeto Gurup\xc3\xa0: a multifaceted initiative involving traditional communities along the lower Amazon river, Brazilian NGOs as well as European donors. Cooperation is sought from local and regional authorities, as well as Brazilian and foreign commercial enterprises.'

Abstract: "The Balbina Dam in Brazil's state of Amazonas floods 2360 km2 of tropical forest to generate an average of only 112.2 MW of electricity. The flat topography and small size of the drainage basin make output small. Vegetation has been left to decompose in the reservoir, resulting in acidic, anoxic water that will corrode the turbines. The shallow reservoir contains 1500 islands and innumerable stagnant bays where the water's residence time will be even longer than the average time of over one year. Balbina was built to supply electricity to Manaus, a city that has grown so much while the dam was under construction that other alternatives are already needed. Government subsidies explain the explosive growth, including Brazil's unified tariff for electricity. Alternative power sources for Manaus include transmission from more distant dams or from recently discovered oil and natural gas deposits. Among Balbina's impacts are loss of potential use of the forest and displacement of about one third of the surviving members of a much-persecuted Amerindian tribe: the Waimiri-Atroari. The dam was closed on 1 October 1987 and the first of five generators began operation in February 1989. The example of Balbina points to important ways that the decision-making process could be improved in Brazil and in the international funding agencies that have directly and indirectly contributed to the project. Environmental impact analyses must be completed prior to decisions on overall project implementation and must be free of influence from project proponents. The current environmental impact assessment system in Brazil, as in many other countries, has an undesirable influence on science policy, in addition to failing to address the underlying causes of environmentally destructive development processes and inability to halt \xe2\x80\x9cirreversible\xe2\x80\x9d projects like Balbina."

Abstract: 'The clearing of tropical rain forest in the Amazon basin has created large areas of cattle pasture that are now declining in productivity. Practices adopted by ranchers to restore productivity to degraded pastures have the potential to alter soil N availability and gaseous N losses from soils. We examined how soil inorganic N pools, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates, nitrification potential and NO and N2O emissions from soils of a degraded pasture responded to the following restoration treatments: (1) soil tillage followed by replanting of grass and fertilization, (2) no-till application of non-selective herbicide, planting of rice, harvest followed by no-till replanting of grass and fertilization, and (3) the same no-till sequence with soybeans instead of rice. Tillage increased soil NH4+ and NO3? pools but NH4+ and NO3? pools remained relatively constant in the control and no-till treatments. Cumulative rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification during the first 6\xc2\xa0months after treatment varied widely but were hightest in the tilled treatment. Emissions of NO and N2O fluxes increased with tillage and with N fertilization. There were no clear relationships among rates of N fertilizer application, net N mineralization, net nitrification, NO, N2O and total N oxide emissions. Our results indicate that pasture restoration sequences involving tilling and fertilizing will increase emissions of N oxides, but the magnitude of the increase is likely to differ based on timing of fertilizer application relative to the presence of plants and the magnitude of plant N demand. Emissions of N oxides appear to be decreased by the use of restoration sequences that minimize reductions in pasture grass cover.'

Abstract: 'We examine the global water cycle characteristics in the Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy v0.3 model (a close relative to version 5.3 of the Community Atmosphere Model) in atmosphere-only simulations spanning the years 1980\xe2\x80\x932005. We evaluate the simulations using a broad range of observational and reanalysis datasets, examine how the simulations change when the horizontal resolution is increased from 1\xc2\xb0 to 0.25\\(^{\\circ }\\), and compare the simulations against models participating in the the Atmosphere Model Intercomparison Project of the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Particular effort has been made to evaluate the model using the best available observational estimates and verifying model biases with additional datasets when differences are known to exist among the observations. Regardless of resolution, the model exhibits several biases: global-mean precipitation, evaporation, and precipitable water are too high, light precipitation occurs too frequently, and the atmospheric residence time of water is too short. Many of these biases are shared by the multi-model mean climate of models participating in CMIP5. The reasons behind regional biases in precipitation are discussed by examining how different fields, such as local evaporation and transport of water vapor, contribute to the bias. Although increasing the horizontal resolution does not drastically change the water cycle, it does lead to a few differences: an increase in global mean precipitation rate, an increase in the fraction of total precipitation that falls over land, more frequent heavy precipitation (>30 mm day\\(^{-1}\\)), and a decrease in precipitable water. One of the most notable changes is the shift of precipitation produced by the convective parameterization to that produced by the large-scale microphysics parameterization. We analyze how changes in moisture and circulation with resolution contribute to this shift in the precipitation partitioning. Because changing horizontal resolution requires some re-tuning, the effect of that tuning was evaluated by performing an additional simulation at 1\\(^{\\circ }\\) but using the tunings from the 0.25\\(^{\\circ }\\) simulation. The evaluation shows that the more frequent heavy precipitation, the decrease in precipitable water, and the shift from convective to large-scale precipitation are predominantly due to resolution changes, while tuning changes have a major influence on the global mean precipitation and the land/ocean partitioning of precipitation.'

Abstract: 'Mixed tree cropping systems have been proposed for sustainable nutrient management in the humid tropics. Yet, the nutrient interactions between intercropped trees have not been addressed sufficiently. In the present study we compare the temporal and spatial patterns of the uptake of applied 15N by four different tree crops in a mixed tree cropping system on a Xanthic Ferralsol in central Amaz\xc3\xb4nia, Brazil, during one year. Most of the N uptake occurred during the first two weeks. Very little N was recovered by peach palm (Bactris gasipaes), more by cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum) and annatto (Bixa orellana) and most by Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa). Due to tree pruning the total accumulation of applied 15N in the above-ground biomass of annatto decreased throughout the year. It remained constant in cupuassu and peach palm and increased in Brazil nut. Brazil nut showed an extensive root activity and took up more fertilizer N applied to neighboring trees than from the one applied under its own canopy in contrast to the other three tree crops. Therefore, trees with wide-spread root systems may not need to receive N fertilizer directly but can take up N applied to other trees in the mixed cropping system. This means that such trees may effectively decrease N leaching when intercropped with trees that have dormant periods or places with low N uptake, but also exert considerable resource competition.'

Abstract: 'Swidden cultivation is the traditional agricultural system in most parts of the Amazonian rain forest. In a remote area in the Manu National Park, Peru, this system was analysed in two indigenous Matsiguenka communities. Diversity of cultivated plants on fields and in homegardens are presented in the current study. Cultivated plants were noted on two to four plots per field on 46 fields, making a total of 126 survey plots. Nineteen homegardens were studied as well. Dominating species cultivated on fields is cassava (Manihot esculenta). Fruit trees such as the peach palm (Bactris gasipaes), guava (Psidium guajava) or Inga edulis, but also cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and a medicinal plant (Cyperus sp.) predominate in more than 75 % of the homegardens analysed. Species diversity increases steadily from 18 and 24 species on 1- and 2-year-old fields to 26, 29 and 66 species in young, medium old and old homegardens, respectively. Seventy-one different species in total were found in all homegardens analysed and 25 in swidden fields. Diversity of species cultivated in homegardens is low compared to other studies in the rain forest of the Amazon. This seems to be due to their remoteness from the next urban centre and to the fact that they are native communities with still low external exchange of information. These findings are in contrast to the hypothesis that remoteness from urban centres increases species richness because subsistence production is based on a broad variety of species. In contrast to species richness in homegardens, differences in species richness in swidden fields between the present and other studies could not be found.'

Abstract: 'Pasture soils in the Amazon become unsustainable after a short period of use, typically being replaced by emergent secondary vegetation (capoeira). The aim of this research was to investigate the photosynthetic capacity and water use in the most common tree species (Vismia japurensis, Vismia cayennensis, Bellucia grossularioides, Laetia procera, and Goupia glabra) in successional chronosequence. This study was carried out in secondary vegetation area with ages that vary between 1 and 19 years. Responses of gas exchange were determined during different periods of precipitation. The gas exchange decreased with advancing age of the vegetation (1\xe2\x80\x9319 years), except for G. glabra. Negative relationships of P Nmax as a function of aging observed for V. japurensis, V. cayennensis, B. grossularioides, and L. procera exhibited r 2 equal to 0.59, 0.42, 0.33, and 0.58, respectively. The species of Vismia showed higher values for photosynthetic parameters in relation to other species across the chronosequence. Overall, there were differences in gas exchange only for some species between the different periods of precipitation. Therefore, our results suggest a distinct pattern of photosynthetic responses to species in early succession. Light decrease can exert a decisive role to reduce the photosynthetic rates in secondary succession species. On the other hand, the results of WUE showed weak evidence of changes for the species during dry and rainy periods in the abandoned pasture in central Amazonia.'

Abstract: 'The contact between savanna and forest in the Amazonia\xe2\x80\x93Cerrado transition zone is characterized by the hyperdynamics of the vegetation (recruitment vs. mortality). However, the related nutrient dynamics under these conditions are not well understood. We determined for the first time the biogeochemical cycles of the vegetation in the zone of transition estimating the litterfall, nutrient input, decomposition rates, and nutrient release in cerrad\xc3\xa3o and cerrado plots. We examine the hypothesis that nutrient cycling is strongly associated with the vegetation dynamics. The litterfall was sampled in 30 traps placed within 1-ha vegetation plots for 2\xc2\xa0years. The release of nutrients from the litterfall back to the soil was also estimated using decomposition bags in the two areas. The decomposition rates did not vary between areas, although in the cerrad\xc3\xa3o the input of total biomass (9.27\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) and total nutrients (219.17\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921), the decomposition of the total biomass, and the cycling of most nutrients through litterfall and decomposition were at least twice higher than in the cerrado. These results confirmed the hypothesis concerning the differences between vegetation types in nutrient cycling, suggesting for the first time that the hyperdynamics observed in both vegetations were also reflected in the biogeochemical cycle, particularly in the cerrad\xc3\xa3o. Thus, it is likely that the rapid and effective cycling of nutrients observed in the cerrad\xc3\xa3o might be a key condition guaranteeing the ability of the cerrad\xc3\xa3o to colonize new areas previously occupied by the typical cerrado.'

Abstract: 'Greenhouse gas emissions from hydroelectric dams are oftenportrayed as nonexistent by the hydropower industry, and havebeen largely ignored in global calculations of emissions fromland-use change. Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Tucuru\xc3\xad Dam provides an example with important lessons for policy debates on Amazonian development and on how to assess the global warming impact ofdifferent energy options. Tucuru\xc3\xad is better from the pointof view of power density, and hence greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity, than both the average for existing dams in Amazonia and the planned dams that, if all built, wouldflood 3% of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Amazon forest. Tucuru\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x99s emission of greenhouse gases in 1990 is equivalent to 7.0\xe2\x80\x9310.1 \xc3\x97 106 tons of CO2-equivalent carbon, an amount substantially greater than the fossil fuel emission of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s biggest city, S\xc3\xa3o Paulo. Emissions need to beproperly weighed in decisions on dam construction. Althoughmany proposed dams in Amazonia are expected to have positivebalances as compared to fossil fuels, substantial emissionsindicated by the present study reduce the benefits often attributed to the planned dams.'

Abstract: 'Three Hg sources were characterised and mass balance calculations were used to determine their relative contributions to the contamination of the Amazonian environment. About an order of magnitude more Hg is emitted to the atmosphere by goldmining activity than by the burning of forest biomass. However, anthropogenic atmospheric Hg cannot account for the high Hg burdens found in terrestrial ecosystems: deposition of Hg from goldmining sources is estimated to account for less than 3% of the Hg present in the surface horizons of soils. We propose that erosion of deforested soils following human colonization constitutes a major disturbance of the natural Hg cycle. Deforestation thus increases soil Hg mobilisation by runoff, which may explain the increase of Hg burdens in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems in newly colonized watersheds.'

Abstract: 'Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is the main source for chocolate with an annual production of four million tons worldwide. This Neotropical tree crop was domesticated in Mesoamerica as far back as 3,000\xc2\xa0years ago. Knowledge of genetic diversity and population structure in farmer varieties of cacao in the center of domestication is essential for sustainable production of fine-flavored cacao beans and contributes to in situ/on-farm conservation of farmer varieties. Based on 70 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, we analyzed 84 fine-flavored farmer varieties collected from traditional cacao farms in Honduras and Nicaragua. The study also included 31 clones from the international cacao collections to serve as references. The SNP based multilocus matching identified six synonymous groups, including 14 Criollo and two Amelonado varieties. A moderately high level of genetic diversity was observed in these farmer varieties, indicating the possibility to further explore intra-population variation and breed for fine-flavored cocoa. Multivariate analysis showed clustering of the 84 farmer accessions in five genetic groups: ancient Criollo, Amelonado, Trinitario (including Nicaragua Trinitario and Honduras Trinitario) and Upper Amazon Forastero (only one accession). The Honduras Trinitario differed from the Nicaragua Trinitario group. The clustering results largely supported the perceived classification of cacao by local farmers and researchers, which was mainly based on morphological traits. However, the well known traditional variety \xe2\x80\x9cIndio\xe2\x80\x9d in this region was identified as synonymous with Amelonado. Parentage analysis showed that the variety \xe2\x80\x9cIndio\xe2\x80\x9d (or Amelonado) contributed more to the Trinitario type farmer varieties, whereas ancient Criollo had less influence. The present study demonstrates the efficacy of using a small set of SNP makers for cacao germplasm characterization, and further depicts the diverse origins and parentage in farmer varieties from Mesoamerica. This information thus will be highly useful for conservation and utilization of cacao germplasm from this region.'

Abstract: "Swidden-fallow agroforestry among ribere\xc3\xb1o farmers in the Peruvian Amazon has been reported to show important regional variation. In this paper diversity in terra firme swidden-fallow agroforestry is described for a single village, Santa Rosa, located at the lower Ucayali river, Peru. Local forest gardens differ in managed species composition, wedding patterns, and yield levels. Most of the produce from Santa Rosa forest gardens is locally consumed; only little is traded. Many forest species are actively tended for planted in forest gardens. These systems have the function of suppliers of a range of products. Variation inforest garden management is a result of farmer' individual perception of the need for such products."

Abstract: 'Insects are known to be able to provide valuable nutrients to indigenous populations across the Amazon. However, studies on traditional insect use in the Peruvian Amazon are scarce. This study documents edible insect diversity and characterizes their food and collection patterns in eight Awaj\xc3\xban communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Additionally, we reviewed what has been known to date about the nutrient composition of the documented species.'

Abstract: 'Vegetation is a major component of the climate system because of its controls on the energy and water balance over land. This functioning changes because of the physiological response of leaves to increased CO2. A climate model is used to compare these changes with the climate changes from radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. For this purpose, we use the Community Earth System Model coupled to a slab ocean. Ensemble integrations are done for current and doubled CO2. The consequent reduction of transpiration and net increase of surface radiative heating from reduction in cloudiness increases the temperature over land by a significant fraction of that directly from the radiative warming by CO2. Large-scale atmospheric circulation adjustments result. In particular, over the tropics, a low-level westerly wind anomaly develops associated with reduced geopotential height over land, enhancing moisture transport and convergence, and precipitation increases over the western Amazon, the Congo basin, South Africa, and Indonesia, while over mid-latitudes, land precipitation decreases from reduced evapotranspiration. On average, land precipitation is enhanced by 0.03\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921 (about 19\xc2\xa0% of the CO2 radiative forcing induced increase). This increase of land precipitation with decreased ET is an apparent negative feedback, i.e., less ET makes more precipitation. Global precipitation is slightly reduced. Runoff increases associated with both the increased land precipitation and reduced evapotranspiration. Examining the consistency of the variations among ensemble members shows that vegetation feedbacks on precipitation are more robust over the tropics and in mid to high latitudes than over the subtropics where vegetation is sparse and the internal climate variability has a larger influence.'

Abstract: 'River runoff into the continental shelf affects the coastal environment in many ways: from sediment input and marine sediments resuspension to meso-scale eddies formation in case of higher river discharges. Therefore, for ocean modeling is crucial to understand the seasonal and interannual river runoff variability. Brazil stands out when it comes to riverine discharge, since 6 out of the 50 largest rivers flows within the country limits. Here, a compilation of all river discharge data provided by the Brazilian National Water Agency resulted in the identification of 97 exorheic rivers (with time series longer than 15\xc2\xa0years), including 10 unmonitored ones which had climatologies estimated by the proposed methodology. This compilation took a considerable effort, as streamflow stations were often far from the discharge location. It was also necessary to overcome the challenge associated with the Brazilian climate heterogeneity in order to apply the regionalization method. The riverine input into the ocean was estimated at the mouth of the rivers, with the overall discharge analysis taking into consideration a division of the Brazilian Continental Shelf in five sectors. These results analyzed here are also made available for public use. Overall, the Brazilian northern continental shelf receives about 95% of the total annual river runoff (212,148\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921), followed by the northeastern continental shelf with 1.5% (3345\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921), the eastern continental shelf with 1.4% (3097\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921) and the southern continental shelf with about 1.3% (2997\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921). The southeastern continental shelf receives only 0.8% of the total discharge (1909\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921). Throughout the year, the major river discharges were observed from summer to winter months, following the different climate and precipitation patterns along the country. The interannual variability of the discharges was assessed, also looking at similarities regarding both El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation.'

Abstract: 'Most previous land-surface model calibration studies have defined global ranges for their parameters to search for optimal parameter sets. Little work has been conducted to study the impacts of realistic versus global ranges as well as model complexities on the calibration and uncertainty estimates. The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate these impacts by employing Bayesian Stochastic Inversion (BSI) to the Chameleon Surface Model (CHASM). The CHASM was designed to explore the general aspects of land-surface energy balance representation within a common modeling framework that can be run from a simple energy balance formulation to a complex mosaic type structure. The BSI is an uncertainty estimation technique based on Bayes theorem, importance sampling, and very fast simulated annealing. The model forcing data and surface flux data were collected at seven sites representing a wide range of climate and vegetation conditions. For each site, four experiments were performed with simple and complex CHASM formulations as well as realistic and global parameter ranges. Twenty eight experiments were conducted and 50 000 parameter sets were used for each run. The results show that the use of global and realistic ranges gives similar simulations for both modes for most sites, but the global ranges tend to produce some unreasonable optimal parameter values. Comparison of simple and complex modes shows that the simple mode has more parameters with unreasonable optimal values. Use of parameter ranges and model complexities have significant impacts on frequency distribution of parameters, marginal posterior probability density functions, and estimates of uncertainty of simulated sensible and latent heat fluxes. Comparison between model complexity and parameter ranges shows that the former has more significant impacts on parameter and uncertainty estimations.'

Abstract: 'This paper reviews the plants used by Spanish speakers in Trinidad and Tobago as documented in a 1994 publication. The plant uses were reviewed to determine whether the plants and uses were different from other ethnic groups in Trinidad and the wider region and to draw conclusions from the review. The review covers 148 plants. With few exceptions, the plants were Native and so were the uses. Several plants have been little studied (Ambroisa cumanensis, Aristolochia rugosa, Bauhinia cumanensis, Bauhinia excisa, Begonia humilis, Croton conduplicatus, Croton flavens, Cyperus diffusus, Desmodium incanum, Fleurya aestuans, Heliconia bihai). The Cocoa Panyols retained the knowledge of at least two plants first described in the 1800s that were no longer mentioned to researchers in Trinidad and Tobago after 1981 by the rest of the population. The Cocoa Panyols preserved their cultural and linguistic heritage by concentrating on cocoa growing in rural areas and their movement from place to place to establish cocoa plantations may account for the uniformity of information on ethnomedicine in Trinidad, which additionally is similar to medicinal plant knowledge of the original populations of South America.'

Abstract: 'Recent micrometeorological measurements for Amazonian rainforest are reviewed, emphasising those aspects of the radiation and heat balance which are likely to change with deforestation. The possible consequences of such deforestation are considered by examining the sensitivity of the surface energy balance to changes in those parameters which would be most drastically altered.'

Abstract: 'I studied a primate community on a tropical rainforest island, in the northernmost area of the Brazilian Amazonia. While walking through six distinct habitats along a 12-km trail, running toward the center of the island\xe2\x80\x94a remote undisturbed area\xe2\x80\x94I collected data on the use of the different forest types and forest strata by the primate community and the formation of either mixed groups or species assemblages. Five species are present: Cebus olivaceus, C. apella, Saimiri sciureus, Ateles belzubuth, and Alouatta seniculus. They seemed to be habitat generalists, using most habitat types. The five species used the higher strata more significantly, probably because Marac\xc3\xa1 does not present well-defined forest floors, which could be a result of being located in the transition between the great areas of savannah and the Amazonian seasonally dry forests. The five species all formed some polyspecific associations, which involved sharing the available food resource. Mixed groups were significantly more frequent and therefore possibly more important to Saimiri, which was not the case in relation to the other four species. Assemblages, defined as the presence in the same clumped resource, without coordinated activity, of \xe2\x89\xa4 3 primate species, were recorded primarily in fruiting fig trees. I suggest that assemblages are impelled by food constraints, forcing cofeeding in large seasonal resources, highlighting the ecological importance of figs to these primates. Linear regression models show that the number of feeding bouts in each habitat type is positively related to the number of fruiting trees exploited, but the density of these fruit trees, diversity of plant species, tree height, and total basal area of each habitat type have no relationship to feeding.'

Abstract: 'The rubber tree [Hevea Braziliensis (Willd. ex Adr. De Juss.) Muell-Arg.] is native from the Amazon region which has great economic importance for being the largest source of natural rubber in the world. Although Brazil is the center of origin and genetic diversity of this culture, the country is currently responsible for only 1% of the world production. Besides offering optimal weather conditions for crop development, the Amazon rainforest region is also favorable to the development of the fungus known as SALB (South American leaf blight), which causes the disease-of-leaves. Leaves fall sharply reducing the production of latex, limiting the production of rubber in this region. Thus breeding programs are seeking for clones which are resistant to this fungus and with high production in escape regions, which provide stress conditions such as low temperatures, high altitude, wind and other diseases [1]. The rubber tree is perennial and requires about 30 years to obtain an improved variety, starting from the controlled pollination of a clone to the final recommendation. Molecular markers such as microsatellites (Simple Sequence Repeats, SSRs) are an important tool for diversity studies and potentially to assist breeding programs. This study aimed to develop an enriched microsatellite library for H. Braziliensis, characterize these developed microsatellite markers and test the transferability of these markers to six other species of the genus Hevea.'

Abstract: ' Astrocaryum standleyanum is a multipurpose palm native to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Western Colombia and Western Ecuador. In Ecuador fruits are consumed locally and fibers from young leaves are used commercially for hats, hammocks, mats and furniture. Harvest, manufacture and trade are centered around Calceta in the province ofManabi. Leaves are harvested in a non-destructive way, using chisels mounted on long bamboo poles. This harvest technique may replace present destructive harvest of leaves from other palm species.'

Abstract: "The Smithsonian Institution's Monitoring and Assessment of Biodiversity Program joined Shell Prospecting and DevelopmentPeru (SPDP) to protect biodiversity during a natural gas exploration project. Emphasis was on long-term societal andenvironmental benefits in addition to financial gain for thecompany. The systematic, cyclical adaptive management process was used to generate feedback for SPDP managers. Adaptive management enables ongoing improvement of management policies and practices based on lessons learned from operational activities. Previous to this study, very little information about the local biodiversity was available. Over a 2-year period, the team conducted biological assessments of six taxonomic groups at five sites located within 600 km2. A broad range of management options such as location,timing and technology were developed from the beginning of theproject. They were considered in conjunction with emerging lessons from the biodiversity assessments. Critical decisions included location of a gas plant and the cost of helicopter access versus roads to service the full field development. Bothof these decisions were evaluated to ensure that they were economically and environmentally feasible. Project design changes, addressed in the planning stage, were accepted once consensus was achieved. Stakeholders were apprised of the implications of the baseline biodiversity assessments."

Abstract: '\nDeforestation and mining are recognized as major threats to Amazonian biodiversity, but, in addition to the well known impacts of clear cutting and industrial mining, the impact of cryptic threats such as illegal small-scale gold-mining and reduced impact logging remain little known. Here, we quantify the impact of those cryptic disturbances on a set of 201 sites dispersed throughout French Guiana. The fish assemblages of 139 pristine forest sites were compared to 16 sites subjected to reduced impact logging (i.e. selective logging), 24 sites with ongoing small-scale gold-mining and 22 sites formerly mined for gold. Controlling for the environmental variability between sites showed the significant structuring effect of all disturbances on fish taxonomic structure, with a marked impact of gold-mining. This effect was of strong magnitude and remained significant after mining activity ceased. In contrast, the reduced impact logging effect remains of low magnitude, although significant. From a functional point of view, gold-mining drives species assemblages towards a decrease in the richness of small-sized stream habitat specialist species and favours larger ubiquitous species living in both streams and rivers. Reduced impact logging effect was slighter, and negatively affected only the richness of phytophagous species. These results, encompassing a variety of hydrographic basins, unambiguously show the detrimental effect of small-scale gold-mining on fish assemblages as well as the slight effect of reduced impact logging. Since gold-mining is one of the most widespread threats throughout the Amazonian region, particular care should be given to controlling this, often illegal, activity.'

Abstract: ' Agroforestry systems are presented as a valuable alternative to pastures to sustain crop production in forested areas. In order to evaluate their effect on soil macroinvertebrate communities, sampling was conducted during the rainy season at four localities located in the Rond\xc3\xb4nia and Acre states of Brazil. Four land-use systems were selected (fallow, annual crop, agroforestry systems and pasture), and compared to nearby disturbed forests. We used the sampling method recommended by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme. Soil macrofauna responded more readily than soil parameters to different cultivation practices. Co-inertia analysis, however, showed a relationship between soil parameters and soil macrofauna. Comparison of communities showed a significant impact of land-use practices. All systems had quite abundant invertebrate communities with relatively low densities in the forest (884\xc2\xa0ind. m\xe2\x80\x932) and in pastures (841\xc2\xa0ind. m\xe2\x80\x932), and higher densities in fallow, agroforestry system and annual crop (1,737\xe2\x80\x931,761\xc2\xa0ind. m\xe2\x80\x932). Earthworms were dominant in pastures (155\xc2\xa0ind. m\xe2\x80\x932 and 56.2\xc2\xa0g m\xe2\x80\x932 on average), whereas termites thrived better in annual crops and fallows (with respective densities of 1,287 and 816 and biomasses of 2.32 and 1.38\xc2\xa0g m\xe2\x80\x932). Macrofauna communities in agroforestry systems were rather similar to the forest, in spite of higher densities of social insects. The termite:earthworm ratios were very low in pastures (0.2), had similar values in the forest (7.9) and the agroforestry system (8.8), which is much lower than in fallows (20.4) and annual crops (21.4) This study showed that all land-use practices were able to sustain sizeable macrofaunal communities with agroforestry communities rather similar to the those of a disturbed forest.'

Abstract: 'The recent and widespread expansion of the pioneer tree species Vochysia divergens Pohl into western Brazil has the potential to significantly alter the structure and function of the Pantanal\xe2\x80\x94a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the World\xe2\x80\x99s largest tropical wetland. Here we assess the seasonal pattern of evapotranspiration (ET) and micrometeorological variables of V. divergens (locally known as cambarazal), located in the Northeast of the Brazilian Pantanal. ET was calculated from a number of micrometeorological measurements recorded between January 2007 and January 2008. The results indicate that ET was the dominant sink for net radiation (R n) during the wet and dry seasons, primarily because the forest was either flooded (December\xe2\x80\x93May) or retained a high level of soil moisture. ET decreased during the dry season due to a decline in R n and surface water availability, and an increase in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. Based on this analysis we conclude that the spread of V. divergens into the Pantanal and the associated high rates of ET are due in part to high water availability, even during the dry season, and the consistently high leaf area index that increases the transpiration surface area when the water table is below the soil surface.'

Abstract: 'This paper gives, for the first time, a complete history of rain forest canopy access, from the early years to the present day. This review is primarily from the European perspective, and explores the development of canopy access techniques, from \xe2\x80\x98low-tech\xe2\x80\x99 methods such as single rope technique, to \xe2\x80\x98hi-tech\xe2\x80\x99 approaches such as canopy cranes. In recent years, canopy science has moved away from pure exploration (the \xe2\x80\x98Wonderland\xe2\x80\x99 phase) to tackling the practicalities of rigorous canopy research (\xe2\x80\x98Reality\xe2\x80\x99), and the underlying emphasis is now shifting from access to the upper canopy per\xc2\xa0se to conducting replicative and manipulative science. The paper concludes by advocating the integration of many access techniques (both hi-tech and low-tech) at selected research sites, and certain neglected key areas of research are highlighted, including the comparison of adjacent primary and logged forests.'

Abstract: 'Determining the effect of tropical land use on the carbon dioxide (CO2) content of the atmosphere requires: (a) estimates of the rates of land use change, (b) estimates of the difference between the carbon stored in forests and that stored in pastures and cultivated fields, and (c) a consideration of the fate of carbon stored in the cleared vegetation. The first article of this series analyzed land use in four tropical countries and estimated the carbon released to the atmosphere as a consequence of changes in land use. This article estimates the carbon released from the entire tropical region based on the two published studies of land use change for the tropics as a whole that distinguish between temporary and permanent land use: Seiler and Crutzen (1980) and Lanly (1982). We combine these estimates with two estimates of the difference in carbon storage between forests and fields derived from Whittaker and Likens (1975) and Brown and Lugo (1982), and the two scenarios of the fate of cleared vegetation, developed in the previous article, to produce several complete sets of data describing the necessary parameters to calculate carbon exchange. These data sets, entered into our model, produce a range of estimates of the annual release of carbon from tropical vegetation in 1980 of from 0.6 to 1.8 BMT/year, with the more likely range being 0.9\xe2\x80\x931.2 BMT/year. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the release from tropical soils due to land use change adds about an additional 0.3 BMT C/year, so that the total release is probably between 1.2 and 1.5 BMT C/year. Peng and others (1983) reported that new models of the oceanic carbon cycle can accommodate at least 1.2 BMT C/year in 1980 from forests and soils. Our results indicate that, given the uncertainties in the size of both the biotic release and oceanic uptake, the global carbon budget may be balanced if there is no significant release from nontropical ecosystems due to land use change and all mature ecosystems are in collective equilibrium with the atmosphere.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity, density, population structure and dispersion patterns of all trees and lianas (\xe2\x89\xa530cm gbh) were inventoried in a tropical semi-evergreen forest in the Shervarayan hills of Eastern Ghats, south India. Such data are necessary for ecosystem conservation of the under-studied Eastern Ghats, as extensive forests here have already been converted to coffee and orange plantations and the landscape changed due to aluminium ore mining and quarrying. Four 1-ha plots were established in Sanyasimalai (SM) reserve forest of the Shervarayan hills, one plot (SM1) located close to mining and quarrying area, two other contiguous plots (SM2 and SM3) located in selective felling area and the fourth (SM4) in a relatively undisturbed forest. These are 1 to 4km apart in the same semi-evergreen forest tract. In the four study plots a total of 3260 stems (mean density 815ha\xe2\x88\x921) covering 80 species in 71 genera and 44 plant families were recorded. Species richness was greatest in the undisturbed plot SM4 (50), while lowest (33) in the selectively felled site SM2. The forest stand (SM4) was also denser (986 stemsha\xe2\x88\x921) and more voluminous (basal area 44.3m2ha\xe2\x88\x921 as compared with the site mean of 35m2ha\xe2\x88\x921) than the other plots. Four trees, Chionanthus paniculata, Syzygium cumini, Canthium dicoccum and Ligustrum perrottetii dominated the stand, collectively contributing to >50% of the total density. Species richness and stand density decreased with increasing tree girths. The forest stand contained a growing population, but there was considerable variation in basal area distribution between the plots. Trends in species population structure varied, particularly for selective-felled species. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25ha and 1-ha scales. Variation in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts.'

Abstract: 'Changes in the structure and composition of a dry forest fragment were described for a 4-yr period (1994\xe2\x80\x931998) in the southeastern Brazil (19\xc2\xb012\xe2\x80\xb205\xe2\x80\xb3 S and 47\xc2\xb008\xe2\x80\xb202\xe2\x80\xb3 W). This is the first dynamic study of a vanishing type of dry forest, which grows on base-rich soils originating from the basalt bedrock of western Minas Gerais State. A survey of trees \xe2\x89\xa5 3.2 cm dbh (diameter at breast height, or 1.30 m) was conducted in 26 transects of 50 m \xc3\x97 6 m (0.78 ha). The species were classified into three regeneration guilds \xe2\x80\x93 pioneer, light-demanding and shade-tolerant \xe2\x80\x93 on the basis of others studies and personal observation. There was a decrease of 10.1% in the number of trees between 1994 and 1998. However, the basal area had an increase of 1.5% in the same period. Size class distributions in 1994 and 1998 were significantly different. The smallest trees (diameter < 10 cm) had the highest mortality rates. Although stand composition showed little change, a few species showed significant imbalance between recruitment and mortality. The studied fragment had mortality (2.3% yr\xe2\x80\x931) and recruitment (1.6% yr\xe2\x80\x931) rates similar to other tropical rain forests for trees \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm dbh. The present fragment of forest (turnover time = 39.5 yr, at cut level 10 cm dbh) lies among the most dynamic tropical forests. The main compositional changes were the increase of shade-tolerant trees and decline of pioneer species. The changes in composition and structure over the survey period may reflect the recovery of the forest after 4 yr of conservation.'

Abstract: 'Productivity and carbon (C) storage in many mature tropical forests are considered phosphorus (P) limited because of advanced soil weathering. However, disturbance can shift limitation away from P and toward nitrogen (N) because of disproportionately large N losses associated with its mobility relative to P in ecosystems. This shift was illustrated by model analyses in which large disturbances including timber extraction and slash-burn were simulated in a P-limited tropical forest. Re-accumulation of ecosystem C during secondary forest growth was initially N-limited, but long term limitation reverted to P. Mechanisms controlling shifts between N and P limitation included: (1) N volatility during slash combustion produced ash that increased soil solution P more than N, (2) a wide N:P ratio in residual fuel and belowground necromass relative to soil organic matter (SOM) N:P produced a simultaneous P sink and N source during decomposition, (3) a supplemental (to aerosol deposition) external N source via biological N fixation. Redistribution of N and P from low C:nutrient SOM to high C:nutrient vegetation was the most important factor contributing to the resilience of ecosystem C accumulation during secondary growth. Resilience was diminished when multiple harvest and re-growth cycles depleted SOM. Phosphorus losses in particular resulted in long-term reductions of C storage capacity because of slow re-supply rates via deposition and the absence of other external sources. Sensitivity analyses limiting the depth of microbially active SOM in soil profiles further illustrated the importance of elements stored in SOM to ecosystem resilience, pointing to a need for better knowledge on the functioning of deeply buried SOM.'

Abstract: 'Drought, as a recurring extreme climate event, affects the structure, function, and process of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the increasing occurrence and intensity of the drought in the past decade in Southwestern China, the impacts of continuous drought events on vegetation in this region remain unclear. During 2001\xe2\x80\x932012, Southwestern China experienced the severe drought events from 2009 to 2011. Our aim is to characterize drought conditions in the Southwestern China and explore the impacts on the vegetation condition and terrestrial ecosystem productivity. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used to characterize drought area and intensity and a light-use efficiency model was used to explore the effect of drought on the terrestrial ecosystem productivity with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. The SPI captured the major drought events in Southwestern China during the study period, indicated that the 12-year period of this study included both \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 precipitation years and two severe drought events in 2009\xe2\x80\x932010 and 2011. Results showed that vegetation greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) both declined in 2009/2010 drought, but the 2011 drought resulted in less declines of vegetation greenness and productivity due to shorten drought duration and rising temperature. Meanwhile, it was about 5 months lapse between drought events and maximum declines in vegetation greenness for 2009/2010 drought events. In addition, forest, grassland and cropland revealed significant different ecosystem responses to drought. It indicated that grassland showed an early sensitivity to drought, while cropland was the most sensitive to water deficit and forest was more resilient to drought. This study suggests that it is necessary to detect the difference responses of ecosystem to drought in a regional area with satellite data and ecosystem model.'

Abstract: 'Few data are available describing the photosynthetic parameters of the leaves of tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF). Here, we present a study of photosynthetic leaf traits (V cmax and J max), foliar dark respiration (R d), foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and leaf mass per area (LMA) throughout the canopy for five different TMCF species at 3025\xc2\xa0m a.s.l. in Andean Peru. All leaf traits showed a significant relationship with canopy height when expressed on an area basis, and V cmax-area and J max-area almost halved when descending through the TMCF canopy. When corrected to a common temperature, average V cmax and J max on a leaf area basis were similar to lowland tropical values, but lower when expressed on a mass basis, because of the higher TMCF LMA values. By contrast, R d on an area basis was higher than found in tropical lowland forests at a common temperature, and similar to lowland forests on a mass basis. The TMCF J max\xe2\x80\x93V cmax relationship was steeper than in other tropical biomes, and we propose that this can be explained by either the light conditions or the relatively low VPD in the studied TMCF. Furthermore, V cmax had a significant\xe2\x80\x94though relatively weak and shallow\xe2\x80\x94relationship with N on an area basis, but not with P, which is consistent with the general hypothesis that TMCFs are N rather than P limited. Finally, the observed V cmax\xe2\x80\x93N relationship (i.e., maximum photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency) was distinctly different from those in tropical and temperate regions, probably because the TMCF leaves compensate for reduced Rubisco activity in cool environments.'

Abstract: "This paper tests Vrba's resource-use hypothesis, which predicts that generalist species have lower specialization and extinction rates than specialists, using the 879 species of South American mammals. We tested several predictions about this hypothesis using the biomic specialization index (BSI) for each species, which is based on its geographical range within different climate-zones. The four predictions tested are: (1) there is a high frequency of species restricted to a single biome, which henceforth are referred to as stenobiomic species, (2) certain clades are more stenobiomic than others, (3) there is a higher proportion of biomic specialists in biomes that underwent through major expansion-contraction alternation due to the glacial-interglacial cycles, (4) certain combinations of inhabited biomes occur more frequently among species than do others."

Abstract: "Spatial variability in selected chemical, physical and biological parameters was examined in waters draining relatively pristine tropical forests spanning elevations from 35 to 2600 meters above sea level in a volcanic landscape on Costa Rica's Caribbean slope. Waters were sampled within three different vegetative life zones and two transition zones. Water temperatures ranged from 24\xe2\x80\x9325 \xc2\xb0C in streams draining lower elevations (35\xe2\x80\x93250 m) in tropical wet forest, to 10 \xc2\xb0C in a crater lake at 2600 m in montane forest. Ambient phosphorus levels (60\xe2\x80\x93300 \xc2\xb5g SRP L\xe2\x88\x921; 66\xe2\x80\x93405 \xc2\xb5g TP L\xe2\x88\x921) were high at sites within six pristine drainages at elevations between 35\xe2\x80\x93350 m, while other undisturbed streams within and above this range in elevation were low (typically <30.0 \xc2\xb5g SRP L\xe2\x88\x921). High ambient phosphorus levels within a given stream were not diagnostic of riparian swamp forest. Phosphorus levels (but not nitrate) were highly correlated with conductivity, Cl, Na, Ca, Mg and SO4. Results indicate two major stream types: 1) phosphorus-poor streams characterized by low levels of dissolved solids reflecting local weathering processes; and 2) phosphorus-rich streams characterized by relatively high Cl, SO4, Na, Mg, Ca and other dissolved solids, reflecting dissolution of basaltic rock at distant sources and/or input of volcanic brines. Phosphorus-poor streams were located within the entire elevation range, while phosphorus-rich streams were predominately located at the terminus of Pleistocene lava flows at low elevations. Results indicate that deep groundwater inputs, rich in phosphorus and other dissolved solids, surface from basaltic aquifers at breaks in landform along faults and/or where the foothills of the central mountain range merge with the coastal plain."

Abstract: 'Droughts and forest fires, induced by the El Ni\xc3\xb1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, have increased considerably over the last decades affecting millions of hectares of rainforest. We investigated the effects of the 1997\xe2\x80\x931998 forest fires and drought, associated with an exceptionally severe ENSO event, on fruit species important in the diet of Malayan sun bears (Helarctos malayanus) in lowland dipterocarp forest, East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. Densities of sun bear fruit trees (\xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm DBH) were reduced by \xe2\x88\xbc80%, from 167\xc2\xb141 (SD) fruit trees\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in unburned forest to 37\xc2\xb118 fruit trees\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in burned forest. Densities of hemi-epiphytic figs, one of the main fallback resources for sun bears during periods of food scarcity, declined by 95% in burned forest. Species diversity of sun bear food trees decreased by 44% in burned forest. Drought also affected sun bear fruit trees in unburned primary forest, with elevated mortality rates for the duration of 2\xc2\xa0years, returning to levels reported as normal in region in the third year after the ENSO event. Mortality in unburned forest near the burn-edge was higher (25\xc2\xb15% of trees \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm DBH dead) than in the forest interior (14\xc2\xb15% of trees), indicating possible edge effects. Combined effects of fire and drought in burned primary forest resulted in an overall tree mortality of 78\xc2\xb111% (\xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm DBH) 33\xc2\xa0months after the fire event. Disturbance due to fires has resulted in a serious decline of fruit resources for sun bears and, due to the scale of fire damage, in a serious decline of prime sun bear habitat. Recovery of sun bear populations in these burned-over forests will depend on regeneration of the forest, its future species composition, and efforts to prevent subsequent fire events.'

Abstract: 'Concomitant with the rapid loss of tropical mature forests, the relative abundance of secondary forests is increasing steadily and the latter are therefore of growing interest for conservation. We analysed species richness of fruit-feeding nymphalid butterflies in secondary forest fragments of different age and isolation and in mature forest at the eastern margin of the Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. From April to August 2001 we collected 2322 individuals of fruit-feeding butterflies, belonging to 33 species. Butterfly species richness increased with succession, but was significantly higher in mature forests than in all types of secondary forest. Isolation of the forest fragments did not have a significant effect on butterfly species richness in the range of distances (up to 1700\xc2\xa0m) studied. Rather it appeared to affect only a few species. Species richness of endemic species was higher than of non-endemic species. Although endemic species were most diverse in mature forests, many species captured were restricted to secondary forests. Our results show that mature forest is essential for the conservation of nymphalid butterflies and for the endemic species in this area. However, considering the relatively large number of species found in these rather small habitat islands, secondary forest fragments, especially older successional stages, can be taken into account in conservation efforts and thus contribute to the preservation of tropical biodiversity on a landscape scale.'

Abstract: 'Worldwide, tropical landscapes are increasingly dominated by human land use systems and natural forest cover is decreasing rapidly. We studied frugivorous butterflies and several vegetation parameters in 24 sampling stations distributed over near-primary forest (NF), secondary forest (SF), agroforestry and annual culture sites in the Northeastern part of the Korup region, SW Cameroon. As in other studies, both butterfly species richness and abundance were significantly affected by habitat modification. Butterfly richness and abundance were highest in SF and agroforestry sites and significantly lower in NF and annual crop sites. Butterfly species richness increased significantly with increasing tree density, but seemed to decrease with increasing herb diversity and density in annual crop farms. A significant negative correlation was found between butterfly geographic range and their preference for NF sites. Our results also showed that agroforestry systems, containing remnants of natural forest, can help to sustain high site richness, but appear to have low complementarity through loss of endemic species confined to more undisturbed habitats. Our study also indicated that the abundance of selected restricted-range butterflies, particularly in the family Nymphalidae, appears to be a good indicator to assess and monitor forest disturbance.'

Abstract: 'A sensitivity study was performed to investigate the responses of potential natural vegetation distribution in China to the separate and combined effects of temperature, precipitation and [CO2], using the process-based equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model BIOME4. The model shows a generally good agreement with a map of the potential natural vegetation distribution based on a numerical comparison using the \xce\x94V statistic (\xce\x94V\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.25). Mean temperature of each month was increased uniformly by 0\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0K, in 0.5- or 1-K intervals. Mean precipitation of each month was increased and decreased uniformly by 0\xe2\x80\x9330%, in 10% intervals. The analyses were run at fixed CO2 concentrations of 360 and 720\xc2\xa0ppm. Temperature increases shifted most forest boundaries northward and westward, expanded the distribution of xeric biomes, and confined the tundra to progressively higher elevations. Precipitation increases led to a greater area occupied by mesic biomes at the expense of xeric biomes. Most vegetation types in the temperate regions, and on the Tibetan Plateau, expanded westward into the dry continental interior with increasing precipitation. Precipitation decreases had opposite effects. The modelled effect of CO2 doubling was to partially compensate for the negative effect of drought on the mesic biomes and to increase potential ecosystem carbon storage by about 40%. Warming tended to counteract this effect, by reducing soil carbon storage. Forest biomes showed substantial resilience to climate change, especially when the effects of increasing [CO2] were taken into account. Savannas, dry woodland and tundra biomes proved sensitive to temperature increases. The transition region of grassland and forest, and the Tibetan plateau, was the most vulnerable region.'

Abstract: '\nThe extensive clearing of tropical forests throughout past decades has been partly assigned to increased trade in agricultural goods. Since further trade liberalisation can be expected, remaining rainforests are likely to face additional threats with negative implications for climate mitigation and the local environment. We apply a spatially explicit economic land-use model coupled to a biophysical vegetation model to examine linkages and associated policies between trade and tropical deforestation in the future. Results indicate that further trade liberalisation leads to an expansion of deforestation in Amazonia due to comparative advantages of agriculture in South America. Globally, between 30 and 60 million ha (5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0%) of tropical rainforests would be cleared additionally, leading to 20\xe2\x80\x9340 Gt additional \\(\\hbox {CO}_{2}\\) emissions by 2050. By applying different forest protection policies, those values could be reduced substantially. Most effective would be the inclusion of avoided deforestation into a global emissions trading scheme. Carbon prices corresponding to the concentration target of 550\xc2\xa0ppm would prevent deforestation after 2020. Investing in agricultural productivity reduces pressure on tropical forests without the necessity of direct protection. In general, additional trade-induced demand from developed and emerging countries should be compensated by international efforts to protect natural resources in tropical regions.'

Abstract: 'The importance of incorporating traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and traditional resource management (TRM) into resource management plans is increasingly recognized, but little quantitative data exists on the ecological and economic implications of these systems. We quantitatively evaluate the TEK and TRM associated with the nontimber forest species, Aechmea magdalenae, in indigenous Chinanteco communities in Mexico. Two TRM systems forA. magdalenae are described and their effects on growth rates of individuals and populations are measured. Simulations using matrix population models combined with yield experiments reveal that one management system is higher yielding and less costly than the other. Thinning and transplanting are two of the most important management practices that enable populations to withstand higher rates of harvest than those predicted in a management plan that was not based on TRM. Quantitative evaluation of Chinanteco TEK is used to discuss how it may be best combined with science in management plans for nontimber forest species.'

Abstract: 'An assessment of the organic carbon stock present in living or dead vegetation and in the soil on the 450\xc2\xa0km2 of the future Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric reservoir in Lao People\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic Republic was made. Nine land cover types were defined on the studied area: dense, medium, light, degraded, and riparian forests; agricultural soil; swamps; water; and others (roads, construction sites, and so on). Their geographical distribution was assessed by remote sensing using two 2008 SPOT 5 images. The area is mainly covered by dense and light forests (59%), while agricultural soil and swamps account for 11% and 2%, respectively. For each of these cover types, except water, organic carbon density was measured in the five pools defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: aboveground biomass, litter, deadwood, belowground biomass, and soil organic carbon. The area-weighted mean carbon densities for these pools were estimated at 45.4, 2.0, 2.2, 3.4, and 62.2\xc2\xa0tC/ha, respectively, i.e., a total of about 115 \xc2\xb1 15\xc2\xa0tC/ha for a soil thickness of 30\xc2\xa0cm, corresponding to a total flooded organic carbon stock of 5.1 \xc2\xb1 0.7\xc2\xa0MtC. This value is much lower than the carbon density for some South American reservoirs for example where total organic carbon stocks range from 251 to 326\xc2\xa0tC/ha. It can be mainly explained by (1) the higher biomass density of South American tropical primary rainforest than of forests in this study and (2) the high proportion of areas with low carbon density, such as agricultural or slash-and-burn zones, in the studied area.'

Abstract: 'Sustainable use of tropical forest systems requires continuous monitoring of biological diversity and ecosystem functions. This can be efficiently done with \xe2\x80\x98early warning\xe2\x80\x98 (short-cycle) indicator groups of non-economical insects, whose population levels and resources are readily measured. Twenty-one groups of insects are evaluated as focal indicator taxa for rapid assessment of changes in Neotropical forest systems. Composite environmental indices for heterogeneity, richness, and natural disturbance are correlated positively with butterfly diversity in 56 Neotropical sites studied over many years. Various components of alpha, beta and gamma-diversity show typical responses to increased disturbance and different land-use regimes. Diversity often increases with disturbance near or below natural levels, but some sensitive species and genes are eliminated at very low levels of interference. Agricultural and silvicultural mosaics with over 30% conversion, including selective logging of three or more large trees per hectare, show shifts in species composition with irreversible loss of many components of the butterfly community, indicating non-sustainable land and resource use and reduction of future options. Monitoring of several insect indicator groups by local residents in a species-rich Brazilian Amazon extractive reserve has helped suggest guidelines for cologically, economically, and socially sustainable zoning and use regimes.'

Abstract: 'It has been generally assumed until recently that tropical rain forests are food-rich biomes for human foragers, and that prehistoric hunter-gatherers once lived completely independent of cultivated foods in such environments. An alternative hypothesis that such forests are actually food-poor for humans is proposed here. Specifically, that wild starch foods such as yams were so scarce and so hard to extract that human foragers could not have lived in such biomes without recourse to cultivated foods. The symbiotic relationship found today between tropical forest hunter-gatherers and farmers is not a recent phenomenon, but evolved long ago as an adaptive strategy for successfully exploiting the tropical forest.'

Abstract: 'The growing importance of resolving ecosystem carbon budgets has resulted in more studies integrating terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes. Although recent estimates highlight the importance of inland waters in global carbon budgets, the extent to which aquatic pathways contribute to the net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) of different ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a cross-ecosystem review of annual carbon budgets integrating terrestrial and aquatic fluxes. Large variability in the proportion of aquatic carbon offset to terrestrial net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was observed, with aquatic offsets ranging from <\xe2\x80\x891% in a boreal forest to 590% in a freshwater marsh. The total aquatic carbon flux was positively correlated with terrestrial NEP, suggesting highly productive ecosystems will have greater aquatic carbon offsets. However, due to an order of magnitude difference in the range of terrestrial NEP (~\xe2\x80\x891000\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921) compared to aquatic fluxes (~\xe2\x80\x89100\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921), ecosystems with small NEP\xe2\x80\x99s had greater relative aquatic carbon offsets overall in their NECB\xe2\x80\x99s. Northern hemisphere peatlands and forests represented 54% of all integrated carbon budget studies collected, indicating a severe ecosystem and spatial bias. Mangroves, agricultural, and disturbed ecosystems were the most underrepresented, yet had extreme ranges in terrestrial NEP and NECB (\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x89638 to 1170\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921). To improve our mechanistic understanding of the role of aquatic pathways in NECB\xe2\x80\x99s, more site-specific integrative studies need to be undertaken across a broader range of climatic regions and ecosystem types.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests are known for their diverse insect fauna. We aimed to determine the effect and relative importance of latitude, elevation and climatic factors affecting species richness and turnover in euglossine bee assemblages along a gradient of 18\xc2\xb0\xc2\xa0latitude from tropical rainforests to subtropical, deciduous dry forests in Peru and Bolivia. Sixteen forest sites were sampled during the dry season. Variance partitioning techniques were applied to assess the relative effects of the spatial and environmental variables on species richness and composition. Furthermore, we conducted a Species Indicator Analysis to find characteristic species for the biogeographic zones. There was a significant decrease in species richness towards the subtropical area. The best predictors of species richness were precipitation and its consequences on soil properties as well as temperature seasonality. The abundance of euglossines was most closely related to precipitation and soil-pH, but the causal links of abundance to these factors is unclear since soil-pH itself is correlated to a drastic turnover of vegetation structure. Based on the analysis of assemblage composition we propose three different assemblages with a transitional zone at the southern tropical area. The biogeographical distribution of euglossine bees along our study transect appears to be primarily related to climatic conditions and does not reflect the common subdividion of Amazonia into drainage systems.'

Abstract: 'The influence of a population of the understorey woody bamboo Merostachys riedeliana and different flooding regimes on tree community dynamics in a section of tropical semideciduous forest in South-Eastern Brazil was examined. A forest section with an area of 1.6 ha composed of 71 adjacent plots was located on a slope ending at the river margin. The section was divided into five topographical sectors according to the mean duration of river floods. In 1991 and 1998 all trees with a diameter at the base of the trunk \xe2\x89\xa5 5 cm were measured, identified and tagged, and all live bamboo culms were counted. Annualised estimates of the rates of tree mortality and recruitment, gain and loss of tree basal area, and change in bamboo density were calculated for each of the 71 plots and five topographical sectors as well as for diameter classes and tree species. To segregate patterns arising from spatially autocorrelated events, geostatistical analyses were used prior to statistical comparisons and correlations. In general, mortality rates were not compensated by recruitment rates but there was a net increase in basal area in all sectors, suggesting that the tree community as a whole was in a building phase. Tree community dynamics of the point bar forest (Depression and Lev\xc3\xa9e sectors) differed from that of the upland forest (Ridgetop, Middle Slope and Lower Slope sectors) in the extremely high rates of gain in basal area. The predominant and specialised species, Inga vera and Salix humboldtiana, are probably favoured by relaxed competition in an environment stressed by long-lasting floods. In the upland forest, mortality rates were highest at the Middle Slope, particularly for smaller trees, while recruitment rates were lowest. As bamboo clumps were concentrated in this sector, the locally higher instability in the tree community probably resulted from the direct interference of bamboos. The density of bamboo culms in the upland forest was negatively correlated with the rates of tree recruitment and gain in basal area, and positively correlated with tree mortality rates. Bamboos therefore seemed to restrict the recruitment, growth and survival of trees.'

Abstract: 'The impact of fire use and hazard in frontier settlement is a critical environmental concern that has been historically overshadowed by deforestation issues- and thus underexamined at local and regional scales by social scientists. Consequently, conceptual frameworks of LUCC change consider fire use as an outcome of land use decisions and neglect the capacity of burning choices to influence these decisions and subsequent land cover change. This paper examines the relationship of settlement, land use, and fire use. It considers recent LUCC frameworks, and then uses household surveys on fire use practices to discuss how the study of fire use can contribute to understanding frontier landscape change. Planting decisions, settlement history, location desires, and burning logistics work in combination to influence burning choices and thus LUCC.'

Abstract: 'On a global basis, a very large fraction (>50%) of the mass flux from land to the marine environment enters from tropical rivers. A broad range of processes active in the adjacent coastal ocean determines the fate of this material. The tropical setting causes many of the coastal processes to be fundamentally distinct from those operating in temperate and polar regions. Therefore, their operation cannot necessarily be understood by extrapolation from empirical observations at higher latitudes. Other coastal processes are influenced by the extremely large water, particulate, and solute discharges from tropical rivers. Further complexity is added by the diverse range of geographic settings through which tropical rivers flow and into which they empty. In summary, coastal\xe2\x80\x94ocean processes in the wet tropics are: globally important, fundamentally different than at higher latitudes, and diverse in operation. Many recent advances have been made in the understanding of the tropical coastal ocean, and it is hoped these will continue into the future. Such understanding is important for predicting processes of river\xe2\x80\x94ocean interaction and terrestrial fluxes to the global ocean, which affect and are affected by human populations. It also can be combined with knowledge of temperate and polar settings to provide a comprehensive understanding of the coastal ocean.'

Abstract: 'Amazonian v\xc3\xa1rzea forests are floodplains inundated by nutrient-rich white-water rivers occurring along the Amazon River. They are regularly flooded for up to 210 days per year by water columns of 10\xe2\x80\x9315 m. Topographic variation results in different flooding amplitudes and durations along the flooding gradient, where the different tolerance to flooding of different plant species results in a vegetation zonation. We made a review of literature about the vegetation composition ofv\xc3\xa1rzea floodplain forests of Brazilian Amazonia along the Amazon River. Twenty-two studies were selected. Basing on the distribution of inventories which are concentrated in three main areas around the three larger cities Bel\xc3\xa9m, Manaus and Tef\xc3\xa9, we classified the inventories into three regions: (A) Estuary region with flooding regime influenced by daily inundations linked to the tides; (B) Central Amazonia near Manaus; (C) Western part of Brazilian Amazonia bordering Peru and Colombia, including Tef\xc3\xa9 and the \xe2\x80\x9cReserva de Desenvolvimento Sustent\xc3\xa1vel Mamirau\xc3\xa1\xe2\x80\x9d. Summarizing the analyzed species lists, 36 tree species were registered in all sampled regions including the estuary. The regions A +C have 63 species in common, region B+C 143, and A+B 50. In the inventories analyzed here, an increase in species numbers from East to West can be confirmed, but it is difficult to state whether this is not an artefact due to local sampling. Vertical zonation patterns are difficult to discuss due to the lack of comparable data. The inventoried areas are small, and there is an urgent need for comparable floristic inventories throughout the basin. Destruction is spreading rapidly and the traditional use of forests and its resources is changing to a destructive exploitation that already has changed much of the physiognomy and diversity of this unique ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'The foundation of ecological restoration is how to preserve biocoenoses (i.e. functional ecosystems) and how to restore and reconstruct them where they were destroyed. One of the most important challenges is the restoration of complex, multilayer forests representing the potential natural vegetation. Native forests have functions in disaster mitigation and environmental protection, as well as providing the basis of existence for local people and maintaining gene pools for the future. Through vegetation surveys in Japan and South-east Asia, we have established basic principles in vegetation-ecological restoration of forests. We have been restoring expected disaster-mitigation and environmental protection forests, as experimental reforestation projects, since the 1970s at more than 750 sites throughout the 3000\xe2\x80\x89km long Japanese Archipelago, and since the 1980s in parts of South-east Asia, China and South America. The restoration movement has spread from a local activity to a global movement. We aim for the sustainable development of human society through ecological restoration of living environments.'

Abstract: 'Resource extraction companies worldwide are involved with Indigenous peoples. Historically these interactions have been antagonistic, yet there is a growing public expectation for improved ethical performance of resource industries to engage with Indigenous peoples. (Crawley and Sinclair, Journal of Business Ethics 45, 361\xe2\x80\x93373 (2003)) proposed an ethical model for human resource practices with Indigenous peoples in Australian mining companies. This paper expands on this work by re-framing the discussion within the context of sustainable development, extending it to Canada, and generalizing to other resource industries. We argue that it is unethical to sacrifice the viability of Indigenous cultures for industrial resource extraction; it is ethical to engage with indigenous peoples in a manner consistent with their wishes and needs as they perceive them. We apply these ideas to a case study in the coastal temperate rainforest of Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada. In this case a scientific panel comprised of Nuu-Chah-Nulth elders, forest scientists and management professionals, achieved full consensus on developing sustainable forest practice standards by drawing equally on Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge and Western science in the context of one of the most heated and protracted environmental conflicts in Canadian history. The resulting sustainable forest practice standards were later adopted by leading forestry firms operating on the coast. Our analysis of this scientific panel\xe2\x80\x99s success provides the basis for advancing an ethical approach to sustainable development with Indigenous peoples. This ethical approach is applicable to companies working in natural resource industries where the territories of Indigenous peoples are involved.'

Abstract: 'Global climate models predict that the increasing Amazonian-deforestation rates cause rising temperatures (increases of 1.8\xc2\xb0C to 8\xc2\xb0C under different conditions) and Amazonian drying over the 21st century. Observations in the 20th century also show that over the warmer continent and the nearby western South Atlantic Ocean, the lower-layer equatorial westerly wind (LLEWW) strengthens with the initiation of tropical cyclones (TCs). The warmer-continent-related LLEWW can result from the Coriolis-force-induced deflection of the cross-equatorial flow (similar to the well-known heat-island effect on sea breeze) driven by the enhanced land-sea contrast between the warmer urbanized continents and relatively cold oceans. This study focuses on the processes relating the warmer-continent-related LLEWW to the TC initiation and demonstrates that the LLEWW embedded in trade easterlies can directly initiate TCs by creating cyclonic wind shears and forming the intertropical convergence zone. In addition to this direct effect, the LLEWW combined with the rotating Earth can boost additional updraft vapor over the high sea-surface temperature region (factor 1), facilitating a surface-to-midtroposphere moist layer (factor 2) and convective instability (factor 3) followed by diabatic processes. According to previous studies, the diabatic heating in a finite equatorial region also activates TCs (factor 4) on each side of the Equator with weak vertical shear (factor 5). Factors 1\xe2\x80\x935 are favorable conditions for the initiation of severe TCs. Statistical analyses show that the earliest signal of sustained LLEWW not only leads the earliest signal of sustained tropical depression by >3 days but also explains a higher percentage of total variance.'

Abstract: 'This study was conducted to evaluate: (1) the bacterial growth and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) uptake in an Amazonian lake (Lake Batata) at high-water and low-water periods of the flood pulse; (2) the influence of nitrogen and phosphorus (NP) additions on bacterial growth and DOC uptake in Lake Batata at two flood pulse periods; and (3) the bioavailability of the main DOC sources in Lake Batata. Lake Batata is a typical clear-water Amazonian lake, located in the watershed of Trombetas River, Central Amazon, Brazil. Bacterial batch cultures were set up with 90% 0.2-\xce\xbcm filtered water and 10% inoculum from Lake Batata. N-NH4NO3 and P-KH2PO4, with final concentrations of 50 and 5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM, respectively, were added to the cultures, except for controls. Extra sources of DOC (e.g., algal lysate, plant leachates) were added to constitute six distinct treatments. Bacterial response was measured by maximum bacterial abundance and rates of bacterial production, respiration, DOC uptake, and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). Bacterial growth and DOC uptake were higher in NP treatments than in controls, indicating a consistent nutrient limitation in Lake Batata. The composition of DOC also seems to be an important regulating factor of bacterial growth in Lake Batata. Seasonally, bacterial growth and DOC bioavailability were higher at low-water period, when the phytoplankton is a significant extra source of DOC, than at high-water period, when the forest is the main source of DOC. DOC bioavailability was better estimated based on the diversity and the diagenetic stage of carbon compounds than on single classes of labile compounds. Changes in BGE were better related to CNP stoichiometry in the water, and the \xe2\x80\x9cexcess\xe2\x80\x9d of organic substrates was oxidized in catabolism, despite the quality of these compounds for bacterial growth. Finally, we conclude that bacterial growth and DOC uptake vary throughout the flood pulse in clear-water Amazonian ecosystems as a result of changes in nutrient concentration and in DOC composition.'

Abstract: 'Our group, composed of modelers working in conjunction with tropical ecologists, 3 has produced a simulation model that quantifies the net carbon exchange between tropical vegetation and the atmosphere due to land use change. The model calculates this net exchange by combining estimates of land use change with several estimates of the carbon stored in tropical vegetation and general assumptions about the fate of cleared vegetation. In this report, we use estimates of land use and carbon storage organized into sixlife zone (sensu Holdridge) categories to calculate the exchange between the atmosphere and the vegetation of four tropical countries. Our analyses of these countries indicate that this life zone approach has several advantages because (a) the carbon content of vegetation varies significantly among life zones, (b) much of the land use change occurs in life zones of only moderate carbon storage, and (c) the fate of cleared vegetation varies among life zones. Our analyses also emphasize the importance of distinguishing between temporary and permanent land use change, as the recovery of vegetation on abandoned areas decreases the net release of carbon due to clearing. We include sensitivity analysis of those factors that we found to be important but are difficult to quantify at present.'

Abstract: 'The foliar stable N isotope ratio (\xce\xb415N) can provide integrated information on ecosystem N cycling. Here we present the \xce\xb415N of plant and soil in four remote typical tropical rainforests (one primary and three secondary) of southern China. We aimed to examine if (1) foliar \xce\xb415N in the study forests is negative, as observed in other tropical and subtropical sites in eastern Asia; (2) variation in \xce\xb415N among different species is smaller compared to that in many N-limited temperate and boreal ecosystems; and (3) the primary forest is more N rich than the younger secondary forests and therefore is more 15N enriched. Our results show that foliar \xce\xb415N ranged from \xe2\x88\x925.1 to 1.3\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xb0 for 39 collected plant species with different growth strategies and mycorrhizal types, and that for 35 species it was negative. Soil NO3 \xe2\x88\x92 had low \xce\xb415N (\xe2\x88\x9211.4 to \xe2\x88\x923.2\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xb0) and plant NO3 \xe2\x88\x92 uptake could not explain the negative foliar \xce\xb415N values (NH4 + was dominant in the soil inorganic-N fraction). We suggest that negative values might be caused by isotope fractionation during soil NH4 + uptake and mycorrhizal N transfer, and by direct uptake of atmospheric NH3/NH4 +. The variation in foliar \xce\xb415N among species (by about 6\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xb0) was smaller than in many N-limited ecosystems, which is typically about or over 10\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xb0. The primary forest had a larger N capital in plants than the secondary forests. Foliar \xce\xb415N and the enrichment factor (foliar \xce\xb415N minus soil \xce\xb415N) were higher in the primary forest than in the secondary forests, albeit differences were small, while there was no consistent pattern in soil \xce\xb415N between primary and secondary forests.'

Abstract: 'Managed fallows which recover nutrients more rapidly than natural secondary vegetation may improve the performance of shifting agriculture systems operating under inadequately long fallow cycles. Our objective was to construct nutrient balances for the soil, vegetation, and litter compartments of six planted leguminous fallows and natural secondary vegetation during 53 months. The fallows were planted on a previously cultivated Ultisol (Acrisol) in the Peruvian Amazon and included:Centrosema macrocarpum (Centrosema),Pueraria phaseoloides (Pueraria),Stylosanthes guianensis (Stylosanthes),Desmodium ovalifolium (Desmodium),Cajanus cajan (Cajanus), andInga edulis (Inga). In addition, in the natural fallow treatment secondary vegetation was allowed to establish and grow naturally. Quantities of extractable P, K, Ca, and Mg, total N, and organic C in soil to a 45 cm depth, and macrouttrients in aboveground biomass, roots, and litter were estimated at fallow planting, at 8, 17, and 29 months afterward, and at fallow clearing (53 months). Total N stocks increased by 10% in the Stylosanthes, Desmodium, Pueraria, and Inga treatments, but changed little in the Cajanus, Centrosema and natural fallows. This difference was largely due to greater net increases in both soil and vegetation compartments in the former group of treatments. In the Inga, Desmodium, and natural fallows, total stocks of P and K at 53 months were about 40% to 80% greater and 12% greater, respectively, than initial values, but Ca and Mg stocks were reduced by 25% to 40%. In the other treatments, there was generally little change in P stocks, but large (30% to 60%) reductions in K, Ca, and Mg during the course of the fallow. Although there were net decreases of stocks of P, K, Ca, and Mg in soil in all treatments during the fallow, storage of P and K in vegetation and litter in the Inga, Desmodium, and natural fallows offset losses of these nutrients from soil. These treatments also tended to accumulate more Ca and Mg in biomass and litter than the other treatments. These results suggest that leguminous fallow vegetation that accumulates large amounts of biomass may increase N, P, and K stocks, but that incomplete recuperation of Ca and Mg may limit the sustainability of short-rotation fallow-based systems on acidic, infertile soils. ei]Section editor: G R Stewart'

Abstract: 'Birds, across their annual cycle, progress through sequences of life-history stages such as reproduction and molt. The mechanisms that control annual avian itineraries involve endocrine responses triggered by seasonal environmental factors, including changes in resource availability and/or photoperiod. However, at equatorial latitudes birds are exposed to different degrees of seasonality, and the mechanisms underlying phenology of birds near the equator remain less explored. We studied the silver-beaked tanager, an endemic Amazonian songbird, from an equatorial lowland population. Remarkably, in this species, song behavior has been shown to be seasonally aligned to minimal changes in day length near the equator. Here, we aimed to further explore the phenology of silver-beaked tanagers by assessing shifts of food sources utilization as potential ultimate factors. We measured triple isotopic tracers of carbon (\xce\xb413C), nitrogen (\xce\xb415N) and sulphur (\xce\xb434S) in blood and feathers of birds throughout a whole year. In addition, we assessed the degree of seasonality in the molting activity, in relation to circulating levels of corticosterone, as well as to testosterone as a proxy of the reproductive condition of males.'

Abstract: 'Prior to deforestation, S\xc3\xa3o Paulo State had 79,000\xc2\xa0km2 covered by Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) physiognomies, but today less than 8.5% of this biodiversity hotspot remains, mostly in private lands. The global demand for agricultural goods has imposed strong pressure on natural areas, and the economic decisions of agribusiness managers are crucial to the fate of Cerrado domain remaining areas (CDRA) in Brazil. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of Brazilian private protected areas policy, and to propose a feasible alternative to promote CDRA protection. This article assessed the main agribusiness opportunity costs for natural areas preservation: the land use profitability and the arable land price. The CDRA percentage and the opportunity costs were estimated for 349 municipal districts of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo State through secondary spatial data and profitability values of 38 main agricultural products. We found that Brazilian private protected areas policy fails to preserve CDRA, although the values of non-compliance fines were higher than average opportunity costs. The scenario with very restrictive laws on private protected areas and historical high interest rates allowed us to conceive a feasible cross compliance proposal to improve environmental and agricultural policies.'

Abstract: 'Forests have been an important issue in world politics at least since the UNCED conference in Rio in 1992. Since then the focus of academic attention has been on global forest governance by an international forest regime complex consisting of several forest-related regimes. This strong focus leaves a research gap regarding regional regimes addressing forests as an issue area, which recently greatly gained in empirical and academic relevance. It is particularly important to understand the institutional structures on the one hand, and the policies developed within such regimes on the other. In order to obtain a better understanding of this in the forest case, the aim of this article is to analyse the institutional design of three regional forest regimes and to develop fields and hypotheses for future research. We built upon the rational design of international institutions framework developed by Koremenos et al. (Int Organ 55(4):761\xe2\x80\x93799, 2001), and based our findings on content analysis of key documents as well as participant observations and expert interviews in selected occasions. The regional regimes chosen for this study were Amazonian, the Central African and pan-European forest cooperation. The results indicate that the designs of the three regimes greatly differ regarding membership, scope, control, centralisation, and flexibility. This seems to be mainly due to differing degrees of formality of the regimes (from treaty to non-treaty to hybrid regimes) as well as different power structures amongst members and regional hegemons involved. Based on our findings, future research fields for the study of regional forest-related environmental, trade, commodity, and management regime structures as well as regime policies are identified. Such insights advance our understanding of international forest governance not only by global, but by regional forest regimes as well. This is particularly true for our understanding that similar issue-specific problems, such as sustainable forest management, in terms of regime structures and regime policies may be addressed quite differently, largely depending on the preferences of regional powers and hegemons and other potential region-specific factors. We conclude by questioning a hypothesised diffusion of international institutions and propose the more precise concept of institutional osmosis instead.\n'

Abstract: 'The humid forests of Amazonia are experiencing longer and more intense dry seasons, which are predicted to intensify by the end of the 21st century. Although tree species often have long generation times, they may still have the capacity to rapidly respond to changing climatic conditions through adaptive phenotypic plasticity. We, therefore, predicted that Amazonian trees have shifted their leaf morphology in response to the recent drier climate. We tested this prediction by analysing historical herbarium specimens of six Amazonian tree species collected over a 60-year period and comparing changes in leaf morphology with historical precipitation data. Moreover, we explored spatial and temporal biases in herbarium specimens and accounted for their potentially confounding effect in our analysis. We found pronounced biases in herbarium specimens, with nearly 20% of specimens collected in close geographic proximity and around the 1975s. When accounting for such biases, our results indicate a trend of decreasing leaf size after the 1970s, which may have been spurred by an observed reduction in rainfall. Our findings support the hypothesis that (some) Amazonian trees have the capacity to adaptively change their leaf phenotypes in response to the recent drier climate. Nevertheless, the unavoidable spatial and temporal biases in herbarium specimens call for caution when generalizing our findings to all Amazonian trees.'

Abstract: 'Earth is always changing. Knowledge about where changes happened is the first step for us to understand how these changes affect our lives. In this paper, we use a long-term leaf area index data (LAI) to identify where changes happened and where has experienced the strongest change around the globe during 1981-2006. Results show that, over the past 26 years, LAI has generally increased at a rate of 0.0013 per year around the globe. The strongest increasing trend is around 0.0032 per year in the middle and northern high latitudes (north of 30\xc2\xb0N). LAI has prominently increased in Europe, Siberia, Indian Peninsula, America and south Canada, South region of Sahara, southwest corner of Australia and Kgalagadi Basin; while noticeably decreased in Southeast Asia, southeastern China, central Africa, central and southern South America and arctic areas in North America.'

Abstract: 'Understanding pasture degradation processes is the key for sustainable land management in the tropical mountain rainforest region of the South Ecuadorian Andes. We estimated the stocks of total carbon and nutrients, microbial biomass and different P fractions along a gradient of land-uses that is typical of the eastern escarpment of the Cordillera Real i.e., old-growth evergreen lower montane forest, active pastures (17 and 50\xc2\xa0years-old), abandoned pastures 10 and 20\xc2\xa0years old with bracken fern or successional vegetation. Conversion of forest to pasture by slash-and-burn increased the stocks of SOC, TN, P and S in mineral topsoil of active pasture sites. Microbial growth in pasture soils was enhanced by improved availability of nutrients, C:N ratio, and increased soil pH. Up to 39\xc2\xa0% of the total P in mineral soil was stored in the microbial biomass indicating its importance as a dynamic, easily available P reservoir at all sites. At a 17\xc2\xa0years-old pasture the stock of NH4F extractable organic P, which is considered to be mineralisable in the short-term, was twice as high as in all other soils. The importance of the NaOH extractable organic P pool increased with pasture age. Pasture degradation was accelerated by a decline of this P stock, which is essential for the long-term P supply. Stocks of microbial biomass, total N and S had returned to forest levels 10\xc2\xa0years after pasture abandonment; soil pH and total P 20\xc2\xa0years after growth of successional bush vegetation. Only the C:N ratio increased above forest level indicating an ongoing loss of N after 20\xc2\xa0years. Soil nutrient depletion and microbial biomass decline enforced the degradation of pastures on the investigated Cambisol sites.'

Abstract: '\nWe used three IPCC climate change scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1) in a dynamic vegetation model (CARAIB), to determine the potential future distribution of 75 tree species used by two endemic primate species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF). Habitat conservation is a vital part of strategies to protect endangered species, and this is a new approach to understanding how key plant species needed for survival of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) and golden-headed lion tamarins (L. chrysomelas) might be affected by climate change and what changes to their distribution are likely. The model accurately predicted the current distribution of BAF vegetation types, for 66\xc2\xa0% of the individual tree species with 70\xc2\xa0% agreement obtained for presence. In the simulation experiments for the future, 72 out of 75 tree species maintained more than 95\xc2\xa0% of their original distribution and all species showed a range expansion. At the biome level, we note a substantial decrease in the sub-tropical forest area. There is some fragmentation of the savannah, which is encroached mostly by tropical seasonal forest. Where the current distribution shows a large sub-tropical forest biome, it has been replaced or encroached by tropical rainforest. The results suggested that the trees may benefit from an increase in temperature, if and only if soil water availability is not altered significantly, as was the case with climate simulations that were used. However, these results must be coupled with other information to maximise usefulness to conservation since BAF is already highly fragmented and subject to high anthropic pressure.'

Abstract: 'This review summarises current knowledge on root interactions in agroforestry systems, discussing cases from temperate and tropical ecosystems and drawing on experiences from natural plant communities where data from agroforestry systems are lacking. There is an inherent conflict in agroforestry between expected favourable effects of tree root systems, e.g. on soil fertility and nutrient cycling, and competition between tree and crop roots. Root management attempts to optimise root functions and to stimulate facilitative and complementary interactions. It makes use of the plasticity of root systems to respond to environmental factors, including other root systems, with altered growth and physiology. Root management tools include species selection, spacing, nutrient distribution, and shoot pruning, among others. Root distribution determines potential zones of root interactions in the soil, but are also a result of such interactions. Plants tend to avoid excessive root competition both at the root system level and at the single-root level by spatial segregation. As a consequence, associated plant species develop vertically stratified root systems under certain conditions, leading to complementarity in the use of soil resources. Parameters of root competitiveness, such as root length density, mycorrhization and flexibility in response to water and nutrient patches in the soil, have to be considered for predicting the outcome of interspecific root interactions. The patterns of root activity around individual plants differ between species; knowing these may help to avoid excessive competition and unproductive nutrient losses in agroforestry systems through suitable spacing and fertiliser placement. The possibility of alleviating root competition by supplying limiting growth factors is critically assessed. A wide range of physical, chemical and biological interactions occurs not only in spatial agroforestry, but also in rotational systems. In a final part, the reviewed information is applied to different types of agroforestry systems: associations of trees with annual crops; associations of trees with grasses or perennial fodder and cover crops; associations of different tree and shrub species; and improved fallows.'

Abstract: ' Land use change with accompanying major modifications to the vegetation cover is widespread in the tropics, due to increasing demands for agricultural land, and may have significant impacts on the climate. This study investigates (1) the influence of vegetation on the local climate in the tropics; (2) how that influence varies from region to region; and (3) how the sensitivity of the local climate to vegetation, and hence land use change, depends on the hydraulic characteristics of the soil. A series of idealised experiments with the Hadley Centre atmospheric model, HadAM3, are described in which the influence of vegetation in the tropics is assessed by comparing the results of integrations with and without tropical vegetation. The sensitivity of the results to the soil characteristics is then explored by repeating the experiments with a differing, but equally valid, description of soil hydraulic parameters. The results have shown that vegetation has a significant moderating effect on the climate throughout the tropics by cooling the surface through enhanced latent heat fluxes. The influence of vegetation is, however, seasonally dependent, with much greater impacts during the dry season when the availability of surface moisture is limited. Furthermore, there are significant regional variations both in terms of the magnitude of the cooling and in the response of the precipitation. Not all regions show a feedback of vegetation on the local precipitation; this result has been related both to vegetation type and to the prevailing meteorological conditions. An important finding has been the sensitivity of the results to the specification of the soil hydraulic parameters. The introduction of more freely draining soils has changed the soil-moisture contents of the control, vegetated system and has reduced, significantly, the climate sensitivity to vegetation and by implication, land use change. Changes to the soil parameters have also had an impact on the soil hydrology and its interaction with vegetation, by altering the partitioning between fast and slow runoff processes. These results raise important questions about the representation of highly heterogeneous soil characteristics in climate models, as well as the potential influence of land use change on the soil characteristics themselves.'

Abstract: 'A revision of the genus Gmelina L. (Lamiaceae) is presented with a summary of its taxonomic history, keys, full descriptions, distribution maps, conservation assessments, ecological information and ethno-botanical notes. For the New Caledonia species no descriptions and distribution maps are given as they have been provided in an earlier publication. In this treatment, 31 species are recognised, 18 names are placed into synonymy for the first time, five are lectotypified, one is neotypified (G. racemosa (Lour.) Merr.) and seven names are excluded from the genus. Two varieties (G. palawensis var. palawensis and G. palawensis var. celebica) are raised to subspecies level. Four new species are described: G. australis de Kok, G. basifilum de Kok, G. hollrungii de Kok and G. peltata de Kok.'

Abstract: 'Based on litter mass and litterfall data, decomposition rates for leaveswere found to be fast (k = 3.3) and the turnover times short (3.6mo) on the low-nutrient sandy soils of Korup. Leaf litteroffour ectomycorrhizal tree species (Berlinia bracteosa, Didelotiaafricana, Microberlinia bisulcata and Tetraberliniabifoliolata) and of three non-ectomycorrhizal species(Cola verticillata, Oubanguia alata andStrephonema pseudocola) from Korup were left to decomposein 2-mm mesh bags on the forest floor in three plots ofeachof two forest types forest of low (LEM) and high (HEM) abundance ofectomycorrhizal (caesalp) trees. The litter of the ectomycorrhizal speciesdecayed at a significantly slower rate than that of thenon-ectomycorrhizal species, although the former were richer in P and Nconcentrations of the start. Disappearance rates of the litter layer showed asimilar trend. Ectomycorrhizal species immobilized less N, but mineralized moreP, than non-ectomycorrhizal species. Differences between species groupsin K, Mg and Ca mineralization were negligible. Effect of forest type was clearonly for Mg: mineralization of Mg was faster in the HEM than LEM plots, apattern repeated across all species. This difference was attributed to a muchmore prolific fine root mat in the HEM than LEM forest. The relatively fastrelease of P from the litter of the ectomycorrhizal species suggests that thematmust allow an efficient uptake to maintain P in the forest ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Bamboos play an important role in forest dynamics, but management strategies are needed to avoid monodominance. Understanding how climate change would influence the geographic distribution of bamboos could provide management tools for habitat conservation, as well as prevent the expansion of this group. We investigated the distribution patterns of Merostachys species that are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, under current and future climate scenarios. We obtained occurrence records based on field collection, herbaria data and online databases. We used the Maxent algorithm to model potential distribution. Future scenarios considered the IPCC forecasted climate for 2070. Our models showed that a reduction in suitable areas for Merostachys species will likely occur, but the existence of suitable areas under climate changes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest indicates climatic stability in some areas of occurrence of these species in their richness center. Since the fact that in places with local dominance of woody bamboos there is a decrease in the diversity of other plant species, the occurrence of Merostachys throughout the suitable areas may represent risks to biodiversity conservation. Investigations of the synergistic effects of climate change and the local dominance of woody bamboos are required. Therefore, management measures may be very important to control the occurrence of woody bamboos in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, mainly in climatically stable areas.'

Abstract: "Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) associated with trees and shrubs plays a major role in the functioning of many ecosystems, from natural woodlands to plantations and agroforestry systems, but it is surprisingly difficult to quantify the amounts of N2 fixed. Some of the problems involved in measuring N2 fixation by woody perennials include: (a) diversity in occurrence, and large plant-to-plant variation in growth and nodulation status of N2-fixing species, especially in natural ecosystems; (b) long-term, perennial nature of growth and the seasonal or year-to-year changes in patterns of N assimilation; and (c) logistical limitations of working with mature trees which are generally impossible to harvest in their entirety. The methodology which holds most promise to quantify the contributions of N2 fixation to trees is the so-called `15N natural abundance' technique which exploits naturally occurring differences in 15N composition between plant-available N sources in the soil and that of atmospheric N2. In this review we discuss probable explanations for the origin of the small differences in 15N abundance found in different N pools in both natural and man-made ecosystems and utilise previously published information and unpublished data to examine the potential advantages and limitations inherent in the application of the technique to study N2 fixation by woody perennials. Calculation of the proportion of the plant N derived from atmospheric N2 (%Ndfa) using the natural abundance procedure requires that both the 15N natural abundance of the N derived from BNF and that derived from the soil by the target N2-fixing species be determined. It is then assumed that the 15N abundance of the N2-fixing species reflects the relative contributions of the N derived from these two sources. The 15N abundance of the N derived from BNF (B) can vary with micro-symbiont, plant species/provenance and growth stage, all of which create considerable difficulties for its precise evaluation. If the%Ndfa is large and the 15N abundance of the N acquired from other sources is not several \xce\xb415N units higher or lower than B, then this can be a major source of error. Further difficulties can arise in determining the 15N abundance of the N derived from soil (and plant litter, etc.) by the target plant as it is usually impossible to predict which, if any, non-N2-fixing reference species will obtain N from the same N sources in the same proportions with the same temporal and spatial patterns as the N2-fixing perennial. The compromise solution is to evaluate the 15N abundance of a diverse range of neighbouring non-N2-fixing plants and to compare these values with that of the N2-fixing species and the estimate of B. Only then can it be determined whether the contribution of BNF to the target species can be quantified with any degree of confidence. This review of the literature suggests that while the natural abundance technique appears to provide quantitative measures of BNF in tree plantation and agroforestry systems, particular difficulties may arise which can often limit its application in natural ecosystems."

Abstract: 'The massive reductions in amphibian populations taking place across the globe are unprecedented in modern times. Within the Neotropics, the enigmatic decline of amphibians has been considered predominantly a montane phenomenon; however, recent evidence suggests amphibian and reptile populations in lowland forests in Central America are waning as well. Unfortunately, very little baseline data are available for conducting large scale time series studies in order to further investigate and confirm declines in the lowland forests of tropical America. Here we compare leaf litter herpetofauna abundance at sites in the Central Amazon, sampled first in 1984\xe2\x80\x931985 and again in 2007. We find no evidence for a decline in abundance or biomass of amphibians over a period of 22\xc2\xa0years at this site. This conclusion differs markedly from the decline of 75% in amphibian populations over 35\xc2\xa0years at a lowland site in Costa Rica. To explore potential declines in lowland Neotropical amphibian populations in detail, we suggest that existing baseline data be comprehensively compiled and analyzed for previously sampled sites and that these sites be re-sampled using comparable methodologies.'

Abstract: 'Some of the characteristics of predicted climate changes for South America are analysed for the years 2010 and 2050. These predictions are based on the results of three-dimensional Global Circulation Models (GCMs). The results differ between models (GISS, NCAR-CCMs and GFDL), particularly when applied to regional and sub-regional scales and to time scales of less than one-year intervals. It is concluded that these differences are due to the particular structure of each model as well as to the lack of sufficient basic data from the South American sub-continent. The dynamics of vegetation cover play an important role in future water balance changes. The changes in surface temperatures predicted by the GISS model are discussed in relation to changes in the climatic-dynamic base stemming from anthropogenic changes in the vegetation cover.'

Abstract: ' Podocarpus sellowii (Podocarpaceae) is one of only a few gymnosperms native to Brazil and the sole species of the genus found in the northeastern region of that country. It has a very restricted distribution in this region, with only three known populations in highland forests (called Brejos de Altitude), which apparently have been isolated from each other since the Pleistocene. Due to this long-term isolation and the fact that these populations have few adult individuals and suffer great anthropogenic pressure, low genetic variability is expected, compromising their long-term viability. The present work assessed the genetic variability and structure of northeastern populations of P. sellowii to investigate the role of Pleistocene glaciations on the genetic relationships between them and to propose strategies for their conservation by analyzing the SSR and ISSR markers of adult and juvenile individuals. Low genetic diversity was found with both markers, associated with a high differentiation of the Brejo de Baturit\xc3\xa9 population in relation to the others\xe2\x80\x94suggesting their isolation at different points in time, probably during the Pleistocene. Actions directed towards increasing the genetic diversity of these populations will be needed, such as planting seedlings with high genetic variability\xe2\x80\x94but the high degrees of differentiation observed between the populations must be taken into account.'

Abstract: 'Life-form spectra are known to vary greatly among different biomes, being largely defined by macroclimates on a global scale. Benign climates usually have biomes with a large proportion of phanerophytes, whereas harsher climates favor life-forms with greater degrees of bud protection. We sampled the flora of a semideciduous Atlantic forest and classified each recorded species in one of the Raunkiaerian life-forms. We then compared the biological spectrum of this seasonal forest with other published spectra of the main Brazilian biomes. We show that each biome has a clear functional spectrum and that the semideciduous Atlantic forest is to some extent functionally similar to Amazonian and Atlantic ombrophilous forests. The relatively moist semideciduous and the ombrophilous forests have biological spectra dominated by phanerophytes. The fire-prone, seasonal \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d savannas have spectra dominated by both phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes. However, the spectra of the semiarid \xe2\x80\x9cCaatinga\xe2\x80\x9d woodlands seem to depend on soil type: woodlands on crystalline terrains are dominated by therophytes, whereas those on sedimentary terrains are dominated by both phanerophytes and therophytes. Sedimentary caatingas have spectra whose features are in an intermediate position between those of crystalline caatingas and moist forests. On a continental scale, macroclimate seems to be the most important environmental factor separating different biological spectra, but wildfires in the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d and soil differences between crystalline and sedimentary Caatinga woodlands also play an important role in defining the local spectrum on a regional scale.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents the theoretical, operational and implementation premises that guide the development research agenda of the Center of Development Research (ZEF), exemplified by three agroforestry-related case studies. First, the importance, assumptions, conditions and priorities for development research in the context of developing countries are reviewed. Second, the three core premises of ZEF\xe2\x80\x99s research approach, (1) transdisciplinary to carry out research on real-life problems, (2) symmetrical partnerships with local stakeholders to sustain ground activities and ensure implementation, and (3) capacity development to warrant future competences, are exposed. Third, these premises are exemplified and mirrored in three agroforestry-related case-studies: (1) slash-and-burn agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon, (2) socio-ecological management of coffee-agroforests in Ethiopia, and (3) afforestation with multipurpose tree species in Uzbekistan. The paper concludes by streamlining the theoretical and practical premises exposed with the presented case-studies, and confirming how these have guided ZEF in the planning, implementation and continuation of development research programs. Although ZEF\xe2\x80\x99s approach to development research is dynamic and continuously subject to assessment, its core remains guiding even after two decades of implementation, appearing to be a suitable pathway for reaching development objectives.'

Abstract: 'Between 1988 and 2000, changes in the above-ground biomass (AGB) of trees in an East Kalimantan lowland forest, damaged by fires in 1982\xe2\x80\x9383 and 1998, were estimated using allometric functions and an annual inventory of stem diameter. The original vegetation of the study site was lowland dipterocarp forest which has since been affected by selective logging and wild fires. The 1982\xe2\x80\x9383 fire killed large trees of primary species and the opened sites became dominated by a few pioneer species. Between 1988 and 1997, a few pioneer tree species, namely Macaranga spp., dominated a heavily disturbed stand (HDS). Primary tree species that survived the 1982\xe2\x80\x9383 fire dominated a lightly disturbed stand (LDS). A moderately disturbed stand (MDS) contained vegetation intermediate between the HDS and the LDS. In 1997, there were 553, 499 and 356 trees ha-1 in the HDS, MDS and LDS, respectively. Macaranga trees accounted for 70, 40 and 11 of the total number of trees in the HDS, MDS, and LDS, respectively. In 1997, the AGB of trees in the HDS, MDS, and LDS was 117, 280, and 315\xc2\xa0Mg ha-1, respectively. The proportion of biomass accounted for by Macaranga trees for the HDS, MDS, and LDS was 34, 8 and 1, respectively. The pioneer trees did not compensate for the loss of aboveground biomass resulting from the death of large primary trees. The fire in 1998 again decreased AGB of the stands. In 2000, the AGB of trees in the HDS, MDS, and LDS was 27, 106, and 219\xc2\xa0Mg ha-1, respectively. The sites opened up by the 1998 fire were covered with the pioneer seedlings and seemingly dominated by the pioneer trees with a larger number of stems per ha, but lower biomass as compared to the original forest (> 400\xc2\xa0Mg ha-1).'

Abstract: 'Evidence concerning mechanisms hypothesized to explain species coexistence in hyper-diverse communities is reviewed for tropical forest plants. Three hypotheses receive strong support. Niche differences are evident from non-random spatial distributions along micro-topographic gradients and from a survivorship-growth tradeoff during regeneration. Host-specific pests reduce recruitment near reproductive adults (the Janzen-Connell effect), and, negative density dependence occurs over larger spatial scales among the more abundant species and may regulate their populations. A fourth hypothesis, that suppressed understory plants rarely come into competition with one another, has not been considered before and has profound implications for species coexistence. These hypotheses are mutually compatible. Infrequent competition among suppressed understory plants, niche differences, and Janzen-Connell effects may facilitate the coexistence of the many rare plant species found in tropical forests while negative density dependence regulates the few most successful and abundant species.'

Abstract: 'Microclimate was recorded and soil organisms were collected 1997-1999 in ecosystem stands of contrasting structure in central Amazonia (a primary forest, a 12-year secondary forest, two different agroforestry systems, a rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation, and a peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) monoculture with a densely closed canopy). The aim was to look at the effects of canopy closure on microclimate and soil organisms. Monthly maxima temperature, average air and soil temperatures, and saturation deficit were highest in September 1997, and total annual rainfall in 1997 was 12-28% lower than in the other study years. The monthly average litter temperatures were consistently 2-4\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0C higher in the plantation sites than in the rainforest and the secondary forest, and temperatures on single days (not the monthly averages) in the plantations were up to 10\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0C higher than in the primary forest. The highest average litter and soil temperatures and the highest temperature maxima were recorded in the agroforestry plantations. Canopy closure strongly determined the litter temperatures in the sites. Soil macrofauna biomass was also strongly correlated to canopy closure (linear regression, P = 0.05). We conclude that a well developed canopy effectively protects the soil macrofauna from high temperature variation and drought stress. Therefore, optimizing these agroforestry systems for canopy closure may contribute to a better management of the beneficial soil decomposer community.'

Abstract: 'The optimal spatial design of protected reserves requires attention to the biological mechanisms underlying community organization, and sustaining ecosystem services. Identifying the key mechanisms is especially difficult in species-rich ecosystems. We investigate the example of the tropical rainforest, a biome that is under threat of continuing fragmentation, yet which shelters the majority of living species on Earth. Simple dynamic and spatially explicit simulations, which model the dynamics of plant communities, allow us to elucidate the interplay between patterns of fragmentation and seed dispersal mechanisms in maintaining biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'A majority of the research on forest fragmentation is primarily focused on animal groups rather than on tree communities because of the complex structural and functional behavior of the latter. In this study, we show that forest fragmentation provokes surprisingly rapid and profound alterations in tropical tree community. We examine forest fragments in the tropical region using high-resolution satellite imagery taken between 1973 and 2004 in the Southern Western Ghats (India) in relation to landscape patterns and phytosociological datasets. We have distinguished fragmentation in six categories\xe2\x80\x94interior, perforated, edge, transitional, patch, and undetermined\xe2\x80\x94around each forested pixel. Furthermore, we have characterized each of the fragment class in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forest in terms of its species composition and richness, its species similarity and abundance, and its regeneration status. Different landscape metrics have been used to infer patterns of land-use changes. Contiguous patches of >1,000\xc2\xa0ha covered 90% of evergreen forest in 1973 with less porosity and minimal plantation and anthropogenic pressures; whereas in 2004, the area had 67% forest coverage and a high level of porosity, possibly due to Ochlandra spread and increased plantations which resulted in the loss of such contiguous patches. Results highlight the importance of landscape metrics in monitoring land-cover change over time. Our main conclusion was to develop an approach, which combines information regarding land cover, degree of fragmentation, and phytosociological inputs, to conserve and prioritize tropical ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Traditional syntheses of the archaeology of the late Pleistocene period in South America have focused primarily on the peopling of the continent by North American cultural groups and on identifying associations among regional sites. This focus has tended to ignore the widespread culture diversity of the period and the possible effects of different paleolandscapes on human migration and colonization, such as the presence of unglaciated tropical and temperate environments in the northern lowlands, the gateway to the interior. The earliest known cultural assemblages are characterized by various unifacial and bifacial lithic industries that may represent regional processes reminiscent of an Archaic lifeway. The major archaeological sites and associated artifact assemblages are examined in terms of regional and continental patterns of environmental and cultural change. Results suggest that the Pleistocene archaeological record of South America must be explained in its own terms and that the events and processes producing this record either occurred earlier than previously thought or are very different from those in North America.'

Abstract: 'Most coupled general circulation models (GCMs) perform poorly in the tropical Atlantic in terms of climatological seasonal cycle and interannual variability. The reasons for this poor performance are investigated in a suite of sensitivity experiments with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled GCM. The experiments show that a significant portion of the equatorial SST biases in the model is due to weaker than observed equatorial easterlies during boreal spring. Due to these weak easterlies, the tilt of the equatorial thermocline is reduced, with shoaling in the west and deepening in the east. The erroneously deep thermocline in the east prevents cold tongue formation in the following season despite vigorous upwelling, thus inhibiting the Bjerknes feedback. It is further shown that the surface wind errors are due, in part, to deficient precipitation over equatorial South America and excessive precipitation over equatorial Africa, which already exist in the uncoupled atmospheric GCM. Additional tests indicate that the precipitation biases are highly sensitive to land surface conditions such as albedo and soil moisture. This suggests that improving the representation of land surface processes in GCMs offers a way of improving their performance in the tropical Atlantic. The weaker than observed equatorial easterlies also contribute remotely, via equatorial and coastal Kelvin waves, to the severe warm SST biases along the southwest African coast. However, the strength of the subtropical anticyclone and along-shore winds also play an important role.'

Abstract: 'Eucalyptus plantations are increasing in Brazil, frequently replacing pastures, but there is still scarce information about its capacity to maintain the fauna of neighbor forest remnants. In this study, we compared descriptors of the communities of leaf litter organisms (lizards, anurans, myriapods, arachnids, orthopterans, coleopterans, and ants) between a large remnant of primary Atlantic Forest and an adjacent eucalyptus monoculture (phase 1). Then, we compared the same descriptors for leaf litter lizards and anurans, Euglossini bees, and frugivorous butterflies among the largest remnant, small remnants at intermediate regeneration stage, and eucalyptus monocultures that were not adjacent to the largest remnant (phase 2). Monocultures were sampled immediately before logging. In phase 1, we detected significant differences in structure between the forest and the monoculture in six out of seven communities sampled. Ca. 81% of the species of the landscape were recorded in the forest, but only 54% of these were found also in the monoculture. In phase 2, the structure of two out of four forest communities was significantly different from the structure of small remnants and monocultures. On average, 76% of the species found in the whole landscape were sampled in the forest. Out of this subset, on average 74% of the species were also sampled in small remnants and 68% in monocultures. Findings of the present study point out a moderate capacity of eucalyptus monocultures to harbor species of the forest fauna even when fully grown but highlights the opportunity that they might offer for increasing connectivity in anthropogenic forest landscapes depending on their management'

Abstract: 'The Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) is a frequent component of agroforestry systems in the Amazon because of its adaptation to nutrient-poor upland soils and multiple uses. We investigated the aboveground biomass production (kg dry weight), nutrient uptake and requirements (N, P, Ca, Mg, K) of Brazil nut trees of different sizes grown under agroforestry conditions and fertilized at different levels. Eight of 70 experimental trees with different size were harvested and stem, branches and leaves were separated. Nutrient contents were determined for three trees of varying size. Average tree growth was fast, but variability was high, suggesting considerable potential for the improvement of this economically important species. The trees responded to increased levels of fertilizer and lime with significantly increased foliar nutrient contents and growth, probably because of the improved availability of Mg and Ca for which the species seems to have a relatively high demand. In contrast to Brazil nut trees grown in forest or dense plantations, the agroforestry trees invested a substantial part of their biomass and nutrients in large branches and developed spreading crowns. To improve stem form, reduce competition with associated crops for light and recycle nutrients, regular pruning of lower branches or planting arrangements that favor self-pruning are recommended. These measures would also increase the recycling of Ca and Mg, large quantities of which are contained in the branches.'

Abstract: 'The results of ethnobotanical fieldwork among two Yanomami communities are presented, and the knowledge of medicinal plants and fungi among those communities is discussed in the light of recent evidence that the Yanomami possess, contrary to previous assumptions, an extensive pharmacopoeia. In addition to the 113 species already known to be used by the group, a further 85 species are documented. Twenty-three species are named and discussed in detail. Considerable overlap is found between the uses of medicinal species by the upland Yanomami and those of the lowland Yanomami, but considerable differences are also apparent. The new data raise the currently recorded total to a level comparable with or greater than that recorded among other Amazonian indigenous peoples. Many of these plants are used in the same way by other indigenous and non-indigenous groups, supporting the hypothesis that their use is based on pharmacological activity. The origins and significance of this knowledge are discussed, with particular reference to the use of plants in the treatment of malaria.'

Abstract: 'This work investigated the effectsof amendments of fertilizer N and lime on subsoil acidity and maize rooting depth in an acid soil of the central Amazon basin. A split-plot designed field experiment was conducted on a clayey Oxisol (Typic Acrudox) during a 16-month period. Main plots received 0 or 4 Mt ha-1 of lime. Subplots were four crop sequences: (1) Maize-green manure (Canavalia ensiformes); (2) maize-green manure (Mucuna aterrima); (3) maize-bare fallow, with the maize receiving 300 kg ha-1 of urea-N; and (4) bare fallow, with an application of 300 kg ha-1 of urea-N at the same time as sequence 3. Plots were periodically sampled to 1.2 m. The experimental site received 4265 mm of precipitation during 16 months; approximately 60%\xe2\x80\x9390% of this rain percolated through the profile. Substantial amounts of Ca were leached from the 0\xe2\x80\x9330 cm horizon during the experimental period, but only limited amounts accumulated in the subsoil. Base saturation below 45 cm was less than 50% at the end of the experiment regardless of lime treatment. Roots of maize were concentrated in the 0\xe2\x80\x9330 cm layers in limed plots and the 0\xe2\x80\x9320 cm layers in unlimed plots. In all treatments less than 5% of the roots was found below 50 cm. An acidity balance indicated that considerable acidity was leached below the plow layer and out of the profile.'

Abstract: 'This study investigated the relationship between the abundance and size ofD. polyacanthos and measures of forest canopy structure. V\xc3\xa1rzea and terra firme forest were selected for study at the mouth of the Amazon estuary, Par\xc3\xa1, Brazil. The forest canopy characteristics investigated included individual tree height and height to base of the live portion of the crown, forest canopy depth (the distance from the lowest foliage in the understory to the top of the canopy including all free space between top and bottom), forest canopy thickness (the portion of the forest canopy depth occupied only by foliage) and forest canopy density (the sum of lengths of each of the individual crowns that make up forest canopy depth) (see Fig. 2b). The attributes ofD. polyacanthos measured included leaf number, stem height and percent coverage within the stands. Results from this study suggest thatD. polyacanthos can be encouraged to grow through selective cutting of canopy trees and promotion of regenerating forest stands on terra firme fallow. The protocol used to relateD. polyacanthos abundance and size to kind of forest canopy structure can be used for evaluation of other climbing palms.'

Abstract: 'This essay critically examines the emerging view among some ethnologists that replicable models of sustainable management of tropical forests may be found within the knowledge systems of contemporary indigenous peoples. As idealized epistemological types, several characteristics distinguishing \xe2\x80\x9cindigenous\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cmodern\xe2\x80\x9d knowledge systems are described. Two culturally distinctive land use systems in Latin America are compared, one developed by an indigenous group, the Huastec Maya, and the other characteristic of colonist farms in Rondonia, Brazil. While each of these systems reflects a different cultural-historical tradition, I argue that the process of knowledge formation and cultural adaptation is coevolutionary and continuous in both cases. The very concept of \xe2\x80\x9cindigenous\xe2\x80\x9d as a discrete analytic category is questioned; indigenicity alone cannot explain local adaptation of farming systems. Rather than dichotomize indigenous and colonist knowledge as inherently different categories, differences in land use patterns between such social groups may be more accurately viewed as reflecting different points on a single epistemological continuum.'

Abstract: 'With malaria control in Latin America firmly established in most countries and a growing number of these countries in the pre-elimination phase, malaria elimination appears feasible. A review of the literature indicates that malaria elimination in this region will be difficult without locally tailored strategies for vector control, which depend on more research on vector ecology, genetics and behavioural responses to environmental changes, such as those caused by land cover alterations, and human population movements. An essential way to bridge the knowledge gap and improve vector control is through risk mapping. Malaria risk maps based on statistical and knowledge-based modelling can elucidate the links between environmental factors and malaria vectors, explain interactions between environmental changes and vector dynamics, and provide a heuristic to demonstrate how the environment shapes malaria transmission. To increase the utility of risk mapping in guiding vector control activities, definitions of malaria risk for mapping purposes must be standardized. The maps must also possess appropriate scale and resolution in order to become essential tools in integrated vector management (IVM), so that planners can target areas in greatest need of control measures. Fully integrating risk mapping into vector control programmes will make interventions more evidence-based, making malaria elimination more attainable.'

Abstract: 'This article examines child mortality as an indicator of the quality of life among migrants living in Brazilian Amazonia in 1980. I focus on migrants in the frontier states of Par\xc3\xa1 and Rond\xc3\x94nia, which experienced rapid settlement during the 1970s. The key question here is the effect of settlement location on child mortality rates. While Rond\xc3\x94nia had lower ratios of population per public health establishments and personnel than Par\xc3\xa1, Rond\xc3\x94nia nonetheless exhibited a higher malaria prevalence in 1980. I therefore attribute locational differences in child mortality to environmental factors important to malaria transmission rather than to health care infrastructure. The findings from multivariate regression analysis show that net of the effects of human capital, migration history and migrant living standards, settling in Par\xc3\xa1 rather than Rond\xc3\x94nia resulted in significantly lower rates of child mortality. These findings suggest that environmental factors coinciding with location of frontier settlement had important consequences for the living standards of migrants in the Brazilian Amazon.'

Abstract: 'The risk assessment of pesticides for freshwater ecosystems in the Amazon has relied on the use of toxicity data and water quality criteria derived for temperate regions due to a lack of ecotoxicological studies performed with indigenous species. This leaves an unknown margin of uncertainty for the protection of Amazonian ecosystems, as differences in environmental conditions and species sensitivity are not taken into account. To address this issue, the acute toxic effects of malathion (an organophosphorus insecticide) and carbendazim (a benzimidazole fungicide) were assessed on five fish and five freshwater invertebrates endemic to the Amazonian region. Subsequently, the intrinsic sensitivity of Amazonian and temperate freshwater species was compared using the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) concept. Amazonian species sensitivity to malathion was found to be similar to that of their temperate counterparts, with LC50 values ranging between 111 and 1507\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/l for fish species and 2.1\xe2\x80\x93426\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/l for arthropod species. However, Amazonian fish appeared to be slightly less sensitive for carbendazim than temperate fish with LC50 values ranging between 1648 and 4238\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/l, and Amazonian invertebrates were found to be significantly more resistant than their temperate counterparts, with LC50 values higher than 16000\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/l. The results of this study suggest that for these compounds, the use of water quality criteria derived with laboratory toxicity data for temperate species will result in a sufficient protection level for Amazonian freshwater organisms. Recommendations for further research include the validation of threshold concentrations derived with temperate standard test species and with the SSD model with semi-field experiments considering larger assemblages of indigenous species under local environmental conditions.'

Abstract: 'This study examines the population structure and regeneration of Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) populations at sites subjected to extractive activities in the Capan\xc3\xa3 Grande Lake Extractive Reserve (Rio Madeira, Amazonas, Brazil). We analyze correlations between three regeneration levels (seedling, sapling and juvenile density) and seven possible explicatory variables related to vegetation structure and human action. The tested vegetation structure variables include adult tree density, crown area, basal area, canopy openness, and fruits opened by agoutis. We also test the time of human use and distance from residences as possible explicatory variables. The density values of the Brazil nut stands in the region are high (12.5 tree/ha), with 60\xc2\xa0% of trees having a diameter at breast height (DBH)\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x8980\xc2\xa0cm. The mean potential regeneration (24.8 seedlings/ha), pre-established regeneration (4.4 saplings/ha) and established regeneration (3.2 juveniles/ha) values are high compared to other Brazil nut tree populations and tend to be greater in the \xe2\x80\x9cintensively used\xe2\x80\x9d stands, defined as sites where human presence during the year is more frequent. The time of human use and the density of adult Brazil nut trees are the variables that best correlate with established regeneration (density of juveniles). The number of juveniles/adult Brazil nut trees is five times higher in intensively used stands than in those moderately used. These results suggest that extractive activities and disturbances in the understory caused by human presence may favor (intentionally or not) regeneration of Brazil nut trees in more-frequently used stands. The data support the concept, frequently suggested in the literature, that aggregations of Brazil nut trees could be a consequence of the activities of Amerindian populations.'

Abstract: 'We present results of research concerning the distribution, depth, volume, geomorphology, and habitat diversity of peatlands in the southern Peruvian Amazon. We identified 295 peatlands covering 294\xc2\xa0km2 and ranging in size from 10 to 3,500\xc2\xa0ha. Individual peatlands were mostly restricted to the meander belt of the Madre de Dios River. Mean peat depth was 2.54\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.84\xc2\xa0m (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89429), however we encountered depths to 9\xc2\xa0m and 10% of the measurements exceeded 5\xc2\xa0m. We developed a calibration factor to calculate peat volume across the study area, estimating total peat volume within 295 peatlands at 657\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89119\xc2\xa0Mm3. An interpolated depth map of subsurface morphology of a single peatland showed that fluvial features were well-conserved beneath several meters of peat and three distinct subsurface geomophological units defined by peat depth could be identified: the Primary Basin, Secondary Basin, and Intrabasin flats. Subsurface geomorphology resulted in increased within-habitat heterogeneity and explained 35% of the variation of pixel values extracted from Landsat\xe2\x84\xa2 imagery. Representing a hydrological link from elevated uplands to the lower floodplains, peatlands in Madre de Dios are especially threatened on local scales by habitat alteration in the uplands and gold mining in the floodplains.'

Abstract: 'We conducted a floristic survey of \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d sensu stricto on Quartzipsamment soils in the northeastern state of Goi\xc3\xa1s, Brazil, in Terra Ronca State Park (PETeR). In addition, we analysed phytogeographical aspects to investigate the floristic relationships between \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d and the Amazon, Atlantic Forest and \xe2\x80\x9cCaatinga\xe2\x80\x9d biomes. Furthermore, we assessed the shrub\xe2\x80\x93tree flora similarity with other sites having the same type of physiognomy and soil class. We collected species along three 5\xc2\xa0km\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa060\xc2\xa0m (90\xc2\xa0ha) transects and recorded 278 species. Erythroxylum loefgrenii Diogo, Eugenia blanchetiana O.Berg and Martianthus stachydifolius (Epling) Harley & J.F.B.Pastore were listed as new records for the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d (Brazilian savanna), and thirteen species were newly recorded for the state of Goi\xc3\xa1s. Approximately, 28% of the species are endemic to the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d, and 72% are shared with other Brazilian biomes. The shrub\xe2\x80\x93tree layer of the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d shares more species with the \xe2\x80\x9cCaatinga\xe2\x80\x9d, which shows the transitional aspects and affinities of the local flora with this biome. The high similarity between the woody flora of PETeR and \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d sensu stricto on Quartzipsamment soil sites in Bahia and northern Minas Gerais state associated with the occurrence of floristic elements that considered typical of the north\xe2\x80\x93northeast portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d phytogeographical province reinforces the inclusion of the northeast region of Goi\xc3\xa1s in this floristic province. The protected area in the V\xc3\xa3o do Paran\xc3\xa3 region represents only 3.3% of the total area of the region and 6% of the remaining natural vegetation in the area. Considering that the studied region holds an important flora and at the same time presents strong anthropogenic pressure from the occupation of agribusiness, it would be extremely important to prioritize conservation strategies to maintain the remaining natural vegetation in the northeastern portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d.'

Abstract: 'Worldwide, rural communities face barriers when accessing health services. In response, numerous initiatives have focused on fostering technological innovations, new management approaches and health policies. Research suggests that the most successful innovations are those involving stakeholders at all levels. However, there is little evidence exploring the opinions of local health providers that could contribute with further innovation development and research. The aims of this study were to explore the perspectives of medical doctors (MDs) working in rural areas of Peru, regarding the barriers impacting the diagnostic process, and ideas for diagnostic innovations that could assist them.'

Abstract: 'The alpha-diversity of trees found in the region of Manaus, Brazil is among the highest recorded for one-hectare plots in Amazonia or any tropical forest. Based on a survey of the distributions of 2541 Neotropical tree species, we analyzed the geographic distribution of 364 species of terra firme forest trees that occur in the region and that are not edaphic specialists. Fifteen distinct distribution patterns were recognized for trees occurring in Manaus. The great majority of species (84.9%) have continuous, somewhat restricted distributions, 35 (9.6%) show broad distributions and 20 species (5.5%) show disjunction between Amazonia and Eastern Brazil. A remarkable 150 (41.2%) of these species showed the region of Manaus as one of their distribution limits. Using the same pool of 2541 species distributions, the percentage of species with a distribution limit in Manaus was compared with that for other localities known to be centers of botanical collection. The null hypothesis that the difference in proportion of species with distribution limits among these localities and Manaus is insignificant was rejected. We conclude that the results are not an artifact of collecting density, that Manaus is indeed a crossroads of distinct phytogeographic regions, and that this explains part of the high species diversity of trees in the region of Manaus. A number of scenarios proposed for the Pleistocene in Amazonia postulate some degree of fragmentation of Amazonian forests or at least populations. As much as these theories may conflict with each other in some respects, they are compatible with the concept of Manaus as a region of re-convergence of isolated or disrupted floras and faunas. The significance of the vicinity of Manaus in the history of the Amazon flora and its current status as a repository for surprisingly high tree diversity highlights the need to make this region a conservation priority.'

Abstract: 'We examined the effects of the conversion of tropical forest to pasture on soil organic matter (SOM) origin and quality along a chronosequence of sites, including a primary forest and six pastures. Bulk soil samples received a physical size-fractionation treatment to assess the contribution of each compartment to total SOM pool. Besides a general increase in total C and N stocks along the chronosequence, we observed a reduction of the relative contribution of the coarser fractions to total soil C content, and an increased concentration in the finer fractions. The origin of the C in each size fraction was established from measurements of13C abundance. After 80 years about 93% of the C in the least humified fraction of the top 10 cm of soil was of pasture origin, while in the most humified it was 82%. Chemical analyses indicated that the fine silt and coarse clay fractions contained the most refractory carbon.'

Abstract: 'Ensembles of 1-year-long experiments with a relatively high-resolution ECMWF model were conducted in order to investigate the impact of modified land surface properties on local, regional and large-scale atmospheric circulations. The modifications consisted of changes to land cover and increased albedo over the northern part of South America. In many respects the experimental design resembles the setting of classical deforestation experiments. The local model response to imposed modifications, which includes a reduction in precipitation as well as in evaporation and an increase in surface temperature, was found to be stronger in dry (July\xe2\x80\x93September, JAS) than in wet (January\xe2\x80\x93March, JFM) season, and in the ensemble with higher albedo value. Local drying is discussed in terms of locally generated overturning that resembles a direct thermal circulation. The effects of this circulation seem to be dominant over the reduction in large-scale moisture supply from the adjacent ocean. On large scales, changes to the Pacific branch of the Walker circulation lead, through modified divergent flow, to a tropics-wide impact on precipitation. In addition to South America, the largest changes are seen in the south Pacific convergence zone in JFM, while the impact on the Atlantic inter-tropical convergence zone is stronger in JAS. In the extratropics, there is little change in precipitation. In the upper troposphere, a distinctive teleconnection wave-pattern could be seen in the Pacific/North American region during JFM. A notable feature in the upper-air model response in JAS is a wave train extending from South America, over the northern Atlantic into Europe. With regard to the interaction between the land surface response and model systematic errors, our results suggest that the erroneous shift of the downward branch of the Pacific/South American Walker circulation is likely to be a cause, rather than a consequence, of the rainfall deficit over South America in the model climatology.'

Abstract: 'The paper examines the debate taking place in Peru, and also more generally in South and Central American countries with large indigenous populations, on the nature of interculturality and intercultural education. It investigates concepts fundamental to interculturality such as democracy and equality and asks what they mean in the context of the Peruvian state, civil society and the indigenous movement. It questions whether an interculturality based in apolitical calls for dialogue and respect for cultural and linguistic plurality can meet the needs of indigenous peoples and their daily confrontations with oppressive and unequal intercultural relations. Taking Peru as an example, it investigates the possibilities for the development of an interculturality that is characterised by equality and participation and which enables indigenous peoples to have greater control over their lives. It then briefly examines the nature of the intercultural lives of the Harakmbut of SE Peruvian Amazon and a new indigenous intercultural education programme which the Harakmbut hope will help them address the inequalities and exploitation which they face.'

Abstract: 'One way of improving natural resource regimes would be through a more careful and consistent identification of rights-holders, with more explicit attention for the relationship between the rights of indigenous peoples and other local non-indigenous communities. This argument is illustrated with a critical analysis of the protected areas legislation in Peru, focusing on the right to consultation prior to the establishment of a protected area, and the rights to use and sustainably manage natural resources within protected areas. On the basis of both international human rights law and empirical data, it is suggested that limiting subsistence-related rights in protected areas to indigenous peoples could endanger the enjoyment of the right to food of the local non-indigenous population. Moreover, the extension of certain human rights that are currently only or mostly granted to indigenous peoples to the broader local population affected by a protected area, should be considered.'

Abstract: ' A recent book by a freelance journalist makes major accusations against genetic studies by J. V. Neel in the Amazon a generation ago. Contrary to these charges, there was no connection of Neel\xe2\x80\x99s work with human experiments conducted by the Rochester Manhattan Project twenty years earlier, nor did the studies serve as a control for survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan. Neel was not a eugenicist. His program of measles vaccination reduced mortality, and was not in any sense an experiment. Given the passage of time and lack of supporting evidence, further investigation of these charges is pointless. However, the political climate in which human populations are studied has changed dramatically over the last generation. Unless guidelines reflect an international consensus, the benefits of population studies to human welfare and science will be jeopardized. The World Health Organization guidelines should be extended to cover current research.'

Abstract: 'Over the past 15\xc2\xa0years income sources in the Amazonian community of Carv\xc3\xa3o have diversified to include government salaries, retirement and welfare benefits, and wages from an evolving informal service sector. These non-farm incomes are now more important to household incomes than the sale of agricultural products. Out of 80 households only three families were found to depend almost entirely on the sale of agricultural goods for cash income. Agriculture is still a part of most families\xe2\x80\x99 livelihoods; however, production today is mainly a subsistence activity. Recent changes in Carv\xc3\xa3o are consistent with trends of livelihood diversification observed in rural societies across the globe. However, current research reveals that Carv\xc3\xa3o is different from other case studies in a number of ways. A history of livelihoods illustrates that residents in Carv\xc3\xa3o have always engaged in a range of activities, including farming, extractive activities, and wage labor. New incomes are the result of new jobs in the public sector and social policies benefiting the rural poor. In contrast to the literature on livelihood diversification, the decentralization of the federal government in Brazil has resulted in greater opportunities for rural income and employment. Consistent with recorded trends, research shows that small farmers in Carv\xc3\xa3o have down-sized agricultural production. Farmers cite low market prices (the result of vertical integration of local markets) as one cause of this decline. Residents, especially small farmers, interested in diversifying agricultural production are limited by inadequate extension services and credit, and younger residents seek public sector employment. Income diversification has increased livelihoods security; however, future livelihoods will depend on new economic growth. Given the stagnating public sector and a weak industrial sector, production geared toward growing urban markets is a viable means for further income generation in Carv\xc3\xa3o.'

Abstract: 'With its network of lotic and lentic habitats that shift during changes in seasonal connection, the tropical and subtropical large-river systems represent possibly the most dynamic of all aquatic environments. Pelagic water samples were collected from Brazilian floodplain lakes (total n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8958) in four flood-pulsed systems (Amazon [n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8921], Araguaia [n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8914], Paran\xc3\xa1 [n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8915], and Pantanal [n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x898]) in 2011\xe2\x80\x932012 and sequenced via 454 for bacterial environmental DNA using 16S amplicons; additional abiotic field and laboratory measurements were collected for the assayed lakes. We report here a global comparison of the bacterioplankton makeup of freshwater systems, focusing on a comparison of Brazilian lakes with similar freshwater systems across the globe. The results indicate a surprising similarity at higher taxonomic levels of the bacterioplankton in Brazilian freshwater with global sites. However, substantial novel diversity at the family level was also observed for the Brazilian freshwater systems. Brazilian freshwater bacterioplankton richness was relatively average globally. Ordination results indicate that Brazilian bacterioplankton composition is unique from other areas of the globe. Using Brazil-only ordinations, floodplain system differentiation most strongly correlated with dissolved oxygen, pH, and phosphate. Our data on Brazilian freshwater systems in combination with analysis of a collection of freshwater environmental samples from across the globe offers the first regional picture of bacterioplankton diversity in these important freshwater systems.'

Abstract: 'The worlds\xe2\x80\x99 current food production system is focused on a limited number of crops. However, international food demand is increasingly looking for more diversified supplies. In the Venezuelan State Amazonas, the Piaroa indigenous people collect and cultivate several indigenous species with local, regional, national and even international potential. A participatory approach was used to select, in cooperation with these Piaroa people, a list of products for in-depth economic analysis and for introduction in agroforestry trials in a later phase. Seven agroforestry food products of this list were identified as underutilized. Primary data collected through consumer and trader surveys on the local markets and participatory exercises in selected Piaroa communities revealed that the main causes of underutilization are the general lack of transport, processing and market infrastructure in Amazonas; the lack of demand, due to a lack of product information; the lack of market information and cooperation between the different market chain actors; and the low productivity of the traditional slash and burn plots. Solutions to overcome the infrastructural constraints are sought by looking at the example set by a local NGO.'

Abstract: 'Along with other human impacts, climate change is an important driver of biological changes worldwide and is expected to severely affect species distributions. Although dramatic range shifts and contractions are predicted for many taxa occurring at higher latitudes, including bumble bees, the response of widespread tropical species is less clear due in part to scarcity of reliable occurrence data. Newly mobilized specimen records and improved species distribution models facilitate more robust assessment of future climate effects under various scenarios. Here, we predict both current and future distribution of the orchid bee Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier, 1841 (Apidae: Euglossinae), a large-bodied species widely distributed in the Neotropics whose populations within the Amazon region are believed to be controlled by cleptoparasitic Euglossini bees, such as Exaerete smaragdina Gu\xc3\xa9rin-Men\xc3\xa9ville, 1844 and Aglae caerulea Lepeletier and Serville, 1825. Under both current and future scenarios of climate change, El. nigrita is expected to persist in deforested areas including those that might suffer desertification. While under current climatic conditions this species is not expected to occur in central Amazonia where the forest is still conserved, its range is expected to increase under future scenarios of climate change, especially in areas corresponding to the arc of deforestation in eastern Amazonia. The increase of human-related disturbances in this biome, as well as changes in the relationship of El. nigrita\xe2\x80\x93Ex. smaragdina and El. nigrita\xe2\x80\x93A. caerulea may explain the potential range increase of El. nigrita under future scenarios of climate change.'

Abstract: 'We developed nuclear SNPs for the heavily overfished tambaqui/cachama negra Colossoma macropomum using next-generation sequencing-based genotyping. We created a reduced-representation library for 30 individuals from Orinoco and Amazon basins following the ddRAD methodology for sequencing on the IonTorrent PGM. We analyzed the sequence data using the software Stacks. We detected 22,476 tags characterized by 7,181 polymorphic sites, recovering 177 loci (268 SNPs) shared between both basins. A significant difference in the allelic frequencies was observed between basins for a subset of these SNPs. Thirty-nine SNPs could be useful for conservation/population genetics using traditional PCR-based genotyping methods.'

Abstract: 'The loss of biodiversity is one of the most urgent global environmental problems of our time. Public education and awareness building is key to successful biodiversity protection. Knowledgeable and skilled student teachers are a key component for the successful implementation of biodiversity education in schools. Yet, little empirical evidence exists on teachers\xe2\x80\x99 detailed understanding of biodiversity. This study aimed to assess student teachers\xe2\x80\x99 conceptions of the terminology as well as their understanding of the distribution and loss of biodiversity. Data were collected from a qualitative in-depth interview study of student biology teachers from Costa Rica and Germany (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8924). Both verbal and visual methods were used to elicit responses. The results show that participants from both countries equated biodiversity with species diversity and had misconceptions about genetic diversity. Costa Rican student teachers seemed to have a more local perspective on biodiversity and unanimously described their local biodiversity as high, and under threat. In contrast, German teachers showed a more global view and were mostly uncertain about the level and threat status of local biodiversity. Prevailing associations explaining the global distribution and loss of biodiversity were heavily based on everyday assumptions, such as the presence/absence of humans, cities, and industries. Additionally, the transnational character of many of the socioeconomic drivers causing biodiversity loss was largely neglected. Although most participants were unfamiliar with the scientific concept of biodiversity hotspots, they implicitly used a naive biodiversity hotspots concept to explain the distribution and loss of global biodiversity. The results are discussed in terms of the educational implications.'

Abstract: 'Despite its importance as a staple food throughout the tropics, the root crop cassava (it Manihot esculenta ssp. esculenta) has traditionally not been a major focus of research. One basic question about cassava that remained unresolved until recently concerns the crop\xe2\x80\x99s origin. This paper describes analyses of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and SSR (simple sequence repeat) variation as a means of tracing cassava\xe2\x80\x99s evolutionary and geographical origins. Genetic diversity was examined in a sample of 20 cassava varieties that are representative of germplasm diversity within the crop, and in 212 individuals collected from wild populations of two closely related Manihot species. SNP and indel variation was examined in portions of two low copy nuclear genes, BglA and Hnl. Inferences from these genes were compared to those from previously examined loci, including the low copy nuclear gene G3pdh and 5 SSR loci. For all genes examined, SNPs and SSR alleles are shared between domesticated cassava and a specific geographical subset of wild Manihot populations, which suggests the following: (1) Cassava was likely domesticated from a single wild Manihot species, M. esculenta ssp. flabellifolia, rather than from multiple hybridizing species, as traditionally believed; and (2) the crop most likely originated in the southern Amazon basin.'

Abstract: 'In a multi-strata agroforestry system in the central Amazon near Manaus, we studied the root activity distribution of different fruit trees and a legume cover crop in comparison to monocultures and a secondary forest site. Uptake of applied 32P, 33P and 15N from 0.1, 0.6 and 1.5 m depth was compared in both the dry and wet season. The results obtained with 32P were similar to those with 15N but showed a higher variability, probably due to the lower mobility of P than N in soil and thus the labeling of a smaller soil volume with 32P. During the dry season, topsoil root activity measured with 15N was around 80% for all species with the exception of the palm tree Bactris gasipaes Kunth., which had a higher uptake from 0.6 m (50%) than from 0.1 m (30%). The subsoil (1.5 m) root activity was higher, when Bactris was not regularly cut for heart of palm harvest but grown for fruit production. Additionally, relative subsoil root activity of Theobroma increased and topsoil root activity of both Bactris and Theobroma decreased when intercropped in comparison to the monoculture. During the rainy season, the topsoil tree root activity slightly increased attributable to increasing water availability near the soil surface. The lowest isotope enrichment was noted for the secondary forest trees despite their low above ground biomass. The magnitude of the isotope enrichment was related to the foliar P and less pronounced to the foliar N contents, indicating higher nutrient cycling for nutrient-rich plant species. Despite the significant subsoil root activity (1.5 m) there was little evidence that large amounts of nutrients below 1 m depth can be recycled by the investigated tree species. More important may be a rapid recycling of nutrients from 0\xe2\x80\x931 m depth.'

Abstract: 'Troops ofSaimiri (squirrel monkeys) were observed in 31 locations in natural habitats in Panama, Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Troop size varied from 10 to 35 animals in Panama and Colombia and from 120 to 300 or more in the unaltered rainforests of Amazonia. Troop size correlated with forest size in all areas.Saimiri associated withCebus (capuchin monkeys) in several areas.Saimiri troops showed different responses to man, fear and flight or neutral responses or curiosity; and these correlated with local environmental conditions. Social behavior varied significantly between the large and small troops. Social interactions were much more frequent and individual distances were much smaller in the large troops than in the small troops. Several factors that may relate to these differences in sociability are discussed in light of data from this and other studies.'

Abstract: 'The genus Oligonema comprises seven species, five of them with worldwide distribution. In this paper, we describe the occurrence and geographical distribution of Oligonema species in Brazil, based on herbarium specimens and author collections in various states and ecosystems. We report Oligonema for the first time in the Midwest region as well as in Cerrado and Caatinga biomes. Here we present descriptions of O. flavidum, reported for the first time in Pernambuco state, and O. schweinitzii, reported for the first time in Mato Grosso state. These two species are rare in Brazil and occupy mangrove, tropical rain forest and savannah environments. This work expands current knowledge on the occurrence and distribution of Oligonema in the Neotropics.'

Abstract: 'The number of invasions by non-native species and their negative impacts is increasing, especially in developing megadiverse countries. The current catalogue of hypotheses, concepts and management policies related to invasions was typically created and evaluated in temperate and economically rich regions. So what we know about invasion biology may not provide a general pattern applicable to developing megadiverse regions. All recent reviews have indicated a demand for more studies in tropical and megadiverse regions. Additionally, potential differences in the quality and availability of data may preclude any comparative analyses between developing and developed nations and hinder global strategies to combat invasions. Therefore, it is important to synthesize the existing knowledge on the subject in order to aid conservation activities in such regions. We conducted a systematic review of non-native species and invasions in Brazil and found geographical bias towards the most populated regions and biomes. Plants and fish were the most studied groups and were, for the most part, intentionally introduced, usually to meet some economic interest. We also noted the dominance of studies concerning terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Most studies did not address species interactions and, in the few cases where they did, the most frequently studied were between non-native and native species. There was a paucity of research beyond the level of species records and descriptive patterns. We highlight major vectors of introduction, the number of non-native species (proxy to colonization pressure) and papers (proxy to propagule pressure) related to each vector and the need for designed surveys and experiments focusing on specific invasion hypotheses and/or species interactions. We indicate major gaps and biases nationally that should be the focus for future studies, and that can serve as examples for other megadiverse countries.'

Abstract: 'The composition, abundance, population structure and distribution patterns of all woody species (\xe2\x89\xa5 30 cm gbh) were investigated in an undisturbed and two adjacent human-impacted sites of a tropical wet evergreen forest in Kalakad National Park, Western Ghats, south India. Three 1-ha plots were established, one each in (i) an undisturbed site (named site UD), (ii) in a site selectively felled 35 years ago (site SF \xe2\x80\x93 small stems felled leaving the large trees (as shade) for developing it into a cardamom estate, on the failure of which the site was abandoned) and (iii) a frequently disturbed site (site FD \xe2\x80\x93 round woods logged for use in ovens for curing cardamom). These sites are 1 to 3 km apart in the same wet evergreen forest. In the three study plots a total of 2150 stems (mean density 716 ha\xe2\x88\x921) covering 122 species in 89 genera and 41 families were enumerated. Species richness was greatest (85 species ha\xe2\x88\x921) in the undisturbed site UD, intermediate (83) in SF and lowest (80) in FD. Tree density was greatest (855 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921) in site SF, intermediate (720) in UD and lowest (575) in FD. The forest stand was exceptionally voluminous in site UD (basal area 94.64 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921), intermediate (66.9 m2) in SF and least (61.7 m2) in FD, due to tree removal for fuel in the latter sites. Species composition and abundance patterns markedly varied between the three sites. In UD and SF, primary forest species (Cryptocarya bourdillonii , Cullenia exarillata Myristica dactyloides etc.) occurred in greater density. In FD heliophilic secondary forest species (Elaeocarpus venustus, Litsea wightiana, Viburnum punctatum and Vitex altissima) were abundant, while these were absent in UD and SF. The species\xe2\x80\x93area curve did not reach an asymptote in any of the sites on the 1-ha scale. The stand population structure was clearly reverse \xe2\x80\x98J\xe2\x80\x99 shaped in UD and SF, while small stems were 2- to 3-fold fewer in FD. Most trees exhibited clumped distribution of individuals on the 1-ha scale. Variation in the kind and richness of species and their abundance is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'Biosystematic studies addressing mechanisms of speciation in widespread, phenotypically variable Neotropical plant taxa are scarce. In Viru\xc3\xa1 National Park, Roraima State, Brazil, we demonstrate that nine phenotypic variables measured from sympatric populations of two varieties within the Humiria balsamifera complex (Humiriaceae) are sharply discontinuous for both vegetative and floral characters. However, these differences were not explained by either phenological separation in anthesis, suppressed reproductive success in experimental inter-varietal crosses, or pollinator preferences, suggesting that pre-zygotic reproductive mechanisms do not contribute to the demonstrable phenotypic differences. Post-zygotic barriers such as reduced germination success in crosses, balancing selection at fine scales, or historical factors such as recent contact among formally isolated populations may account for the maintenance of phenotypic variation among these sympatric varieties. Future studies relating genetic structure with phenotypic variation may shed light on the mechanisms which promote and maintain large Neotropical species complexes such as in this case.'

Abstract: ' The survival of primates in moderately disturbed forests is determined by a complex of variables. Correlation analyses suggest that ecological features of a species may confer a basal survival ability but that details of the form of disturbance may be crucially important. Correlation analyses reveal that body size alone is a poor predictor of primate response to moderate forest disturbance. However, when the effects of diet variables are held constant, body size more strongly correlates with survival ability (smaller species surviving better). Degree of frugivory shows a significant negative correlation with survival ability at both univariate and multivariate levels of analysis. In contrast, dietetic diversity is not correlated with survival ability at either level of analysis. Together, body size and percentage frugivory explain 44% of the variation in species\xe2\x80\x99 responses to moderate habitat disturbance. Idiosyncratic responses of species can usually be traced to specific features of the changing environment, such as selective elimination of important food sources and, conversely, the presence of increased densities of particular food sources arising from the disturbance.'

Abstract: 'A taxonomic treatment for the 11 species of Elaphoglossum sect. Polytrichia found in Brazil is presented. The species of this section are recognized morphologically by the presence of subulate scales and lack of hydathodes on adult leaves. Two new species are described: E. amorimii and E. brevipetiolatum, both endemic to the Atlantic rainforest of eastern Brazil. Elaphoglossum brevipetiolatum is unusual in section Polytrichia by lacking subulate scales. Elaphoglossum polyblepharum, which was previously known only from Venezuela, is recorded for the first time in Brazil. Additionally, misapplied names that have long been used in the literature and herbarium specimens, such as E. apodum, E. beitelii, E. erinaceum, E. ornatum, and E. propinquum, are here excluded from the Brazilian flora. We provide identification keys, illustrations, descriptions, comments, synonymy, distribution maps, and an index to collector\xe2\x80\x99s names and numbers for all the species.'

Abstract: 'Three closely affiliated species of Heterospathe Scheff. (H. elegans (Becc.) Becc., H. humilis Becc. and H. versteegiana Becc.) from New Guinea are revised. They are reduced to a single species which is divided into two subspecies, and the new combination H. elegans subsp. humilis (Becc.) M. S. Trudgen & W. J. Baker is made. The subspecies can be readily distinguished by their growth habit. Epitypes are designated for the three previously published names, as informative material on the habit is not included in the existing type specimens. A new, potentially related species is described as H. pullenii M. S. Trudgen & W. J. Baker.'

Abstract: "Geertz's famous hypothesis that horticulturalists practicing shifting cultivation intercrop their plots to mimic the protective structure of the tropical forest is evaluated in view of data on the structural ecology of the tropical forest and swidden plots in Amazonian Ecuador. The cultivation practices of the Siona-Secoya Indians reveal a three-fold typology of cropping patterns (high-diversity intercropping, low-diversity intercropping, and monocropping), with variation among the types in terms of plot size and distribution, cultigen inventory, structural complexity, and function. These gardens and the tropical forest are compared and analyzed in terms of morphology, ecological characteristics, and human manipulation and utilization. Gardens with high-diversity intercropping show certain similarities to the tropical forest, as Geertz's model predicts, but their highly transient structure does not function as a mature ecosystem. Furthermore, plots with low-diversity intercropping and monocropping show few similarities to the forest. Garden structure is best understood in terms of the economic utilization of tropical cultigens displaying specific habits, rather than by analogy to tropical forest physiognomy and function."

Abstract: 'To advance ongoing revisionary research on the neotropical genus Swartzia, we studied herbarium collections from the southern Amazonian Craton of Brazil. Among these collections four previously undocumented species were discovered: Swartzia lanata, S. prancei, S. rugosa and S. rondoniensis, each individually diagnosable and endemic to the region. In this paper we provide formal descriptions for these and make a new combination for a fifth, S. arumateuana. The new species are known from few collections and are divided evenly among sections Recurvae and Terminales, the two most speciose sections of the genus in the region. This study provides further evidence that the southern Amazonian Craton, while less central to the diversification of Swartzia than the Guiana Shield, is nevertheless important both as an area of species diversity and endemism.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents economic rules for harvest timing when timber and nontimber goods, services, and ecological functions are produced from forest stands. Forests include stands that are heterogeneous in age, land quality, and distance to market. Rules for allocating land between forest and nonforest use are developed. Key land use margins are identified that are important to land use allocation in temperate and tropical regions (e.g., between unmanaged forest, forest management, and forest conversion). Processes that can change key land use margins are discussed and used to organize recent empirical and theoretical studies of regions where forest land use is in transition, such as where forest land is being converted to alternative nonforest land uses.'

Abstract: 'A novel simplified configuration is proposed for the conversion of biomass to ethanol using whole medium enzymatic cocktails (WM) and enzymatic extracts (EE) from different filamentous fungi (Trichoderma reesei, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus oryzae) cultivated under solid-state fermentation (SSF) for the hydrolysis of steam-exploded sugarcane bagasse (SESB). The hydrolyzed material derived from the saccharification of SESB using the combinations A. niger WM + T. reesei EE, A. oryzae WM + A. niger EE, and A. niger EE + T. reesei WM resulted in the best biomass conversion yields (66, 65, and 64\xc2\xa0% of the theoretical reducing sugar yields, respectively). The best ethanol production (84\xc2\xa0% of the theoretical yield) was obtained using the material hydrolyzed by a combination of A. oryzae WM + A. niger EE. The enzymatic conversion of SESB using on-site produced enzymes from the whole SSF cultivation medium, followed by an ethanol production step, is a potential configuration for the biomass to ethanol conversion process. This novel simplified configuration would enable the use of a single reactor system, avoiding the need for additional separation steps.'

Abstract: 'Minimizing the deleterious environmental impacts of logging and other silvicultural treatments is the primary conservation goal in tropical forests managed for timber production. While it is always environmentally beneficial to minimize unnecessary damage, more intensive silviculture should not be discouraged in tropical forests in which regeneration and growth of commercially valuable timber species requires such treatments. Failing to regenerate commercial species may render forests more susceptible to conversion to other, more lucrative land uses. Increasing the intensity of silviculture may also decrease the total area of forest exploited for timber, thereby reducing the impacts of over-hunting, timber theft, wildfires, colonization, and conversion, which are facilitated by the increased accessibility of logged areas.'

Abstract: "The causes of the degradation of Brazilian Atlantic Forest in the south-eastern cocoa region of the State of Bahia are investigated by means of a survey on cocoa planter's forest conservation attitudes. Large land-owners were found to be responsible for most of the forest clearing that occurred in the past: cocoa prices compensated investment in the expansion of the area planted to cocoa on planters' forested land-holdings. Large land-owners were also responsible for most of the recent forest clearing, which occurred simply to sell trees in order to earn income while cocoa prices were depressed. Large land-owners are nonetheless more interested than small land-owners in conserving some of their forest. Policies encouraging private forest conservation, and the development of forest-conserving agricultural alternatives for the landless poor are recommended."

Abstract: 'Studies of net primary production in four contrasting tropical grasslands show that when full account is taken of losses of plant organs above- and below-ground these ecosystems are far more productive than earlier suggested. Previous values have mainly been provided by the International Biological Programme (IBP), where estimates of production were based on a change in vegetation mass alone and would not necessarily have taken full account of organ losses and turnover. Calculation at three of our sites based on estblished methodology using changes in plant mass alone (i.e. that used by the International Biological Programme, IBP) proved to be serious underestimates of when acount was taken of losses simultaneously with measurement of change in plant mass. Accounting for the turnover of material at these three sites resulted in productivities up to five times higher than were obtained using the standard IBP procedure. An emergent C4 grass stand at a fourth site in the Amazon achieved a productivity which approached the maximum recorded for agricultural crops. In this case, productivity values, when organ losses were taken into account, only slightly exceeded that obtained with IBP methods. The findings reported here have wider implications, in prediction of global carbon cycling, remote sensing of plant productivity and impact assessment of conversion to arable cropping systems.'

Abstract: 'Species-area relationships predict that there is a positive relationship between the number of species and the size of an area. It has been suggested that species richness will covary with area because larger areas have a greater diversity of habitats. Moreover, habitat diversity may operate in conjunction with riverine barriers to influence primate biogeography. Few studies have determined if and how these hypotheses relate to primate diversity in Guyana. To test these biogeographic hypotheses, I used data from 1,725 km of primate surveys I conducted in Guyana. I estimated geographic ranges for each of the 8 primate species via a GIS system. Geographic range size is a major determinant of the number of sightings of the 8 primate species. Primate species diversity is strongly negatively correlated with the number of rivers crossed moving in a clockwise pattern from eastern to NW Guyana. Interfluvial and habitat areas influence primate species diversity in Guyana. However, my data on primate biogeography in Guyana do not support the hypothesis that habitat diversity within the interfluvial areas effects primate diversity. Although the species-area relationship is considered the closest thing to a rule in ecology, researchers should be wary of too readily applying and accepting the model at all scales in biogeographic studies.'

Abstract: 'There has been an increasing interest by researchers to study aging among various \xe2\x80\x98traditional societies.\xe2\x80\x99 However, few studies have specifically examined the differences between lifestyle variables and cardiovascular risk factors among sex-specific age cohorts in Amazon populations. In Western societies, age, obesity, fat distribution, and diet are common correlates of blood pressure (BP). However, these variables may not be significant correlates of BP in more traditional-living societies. For example, outside pressures placed upon their environments and lifestyles can ultimately affect their overall health status. Currently, there are few isolated Amazonian groups pursuing even modified versions of their traditional lifeways. Those that do exist have been reduced by numerous factors, including land conflicts, pollution, infectious diseases, and persistent pressures to acculturate into the dominant society. In most traditional living groups, older individuals appear to be the most resistant to social change. However, the definition of \xe2\x80\x98older\xe2\x80\x99 in these populations is a group-specific cultural construct. This study examines intravillage and intervillage sex-specific cohorts to investigate the complex relationships between age, cultural change and cardiovascular risk factors among an Amazonian population, the Cof\xc3\xa1n of Northeastern Ecuador.'

Abstract: 'Rhizotrons provide valuable information about plant root production, but measurements are usually made in units of root length per unit surface area of observation window surface. These measurement units are not easily comparable to above-ground plant growth. To address this deficiency, several techniques have been developed to convert rhizotron measurement units into root mass production per unit ground area. In this study, four different conversion methods were applied to the same dataset of rhizotron measurements. This data was used to reveal the effect of conversion method upon estimates of the temporal variation in, and annual magnitude of, gross root mass production. Application of four different conversion methods resulted in gross root production estimates ranging between 2.1 and 11.4\xc2\xa0t ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921. Temporal variation in gross root mass production also varied between methods. All current methods for quantifying root production are likely to cause some disturbance and bias. Based upon a comparison of the sources of error present in each conversion method, we assess which methods are likely to produce the most reliable estimates of root biomass production per unit ground area, and propose additional measurements which could further improve accuracy.'

Abstract: 'Troops ofSaimiri (squirrel monkeys) were observed in 31 locations in natural habitats in Panama, Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Troop size varied from 10 to 35 animals in Panama and Colombia and from 120 to 300 or more in the unaltered rainforests of Amazonia. Troop size correlated with forest size in all areas.Saimiri associated withCebus (capuchin monkeys) in several areas.Saimiri troops showed different responses to man, fear and flight or neutral responses or curiosity; and these correlated with local environmental conditions. Social behavior varied significantly between the large and small troops. Social interactions were much more frequent and individual distances were much smaller in the large troops than in the small troops. Several factors that may relate to these differences in sociability are discussed in light of data from this and other studies.'

Abstract: 'The structure and dynamics of approximately 64 ha of undisturbed gallery forest were studied over six years. Trees from 31 cm gbh (c. 10 cm dbh) were measured every three years from 1985. They were in 151 (10\xc3\x9720 m) permanent plots in the Gama forest in the Federal District of Brazil. Natural regeneration (individuals under 31 cm gbh) was measured in subplots (of 2\xc3\x972 m, 5\xc3\x975 m and 10\xc3\x9710 m) within the 200 m2 plots. The total tree flora (gbh\xe2\x89\xa531 cm) consisted of 93 species, 81 genera and 44 families in 1985. The Leguminosae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae were the families richest in number of species. Most individuals and species were under 45 cm diameter and 20 m high while the maximum diameter per species ranged from 30 to 95 cm. The density structure of trees and natural regeneration was similar, in which the densities of c. 80% of the species represented less than 1% of the total density. The periodic mean annual diameter increment for trees from 10 cm dbh, was c. 0.25 cm/year. Variability was high with coefficients of variation c. 100% or more. The Gama community may maintain tree diversity and structure in undisturbed conditions. Regeneration of c. 80% of the species was found in the establishing phase (poles); the diameter structure was typical of native forests with the number of individuals decreasing with increasing size classes and showing little change over the six years; recruitment compensated for the mortality of most of the abundant species. The soils in Gama gallery forest were dystrophic with high aluminium content. Multivariate analysis suggested the stream, natural gaps and edges as the main causes of floristic differentiation at the community level.'

Abstract: 'The total number of vascular plant species was counted and growth form distribution was studied in the Choc\xc3\xb3 area on the Pacific coast of Colombia, in two transects 400\xc3\x9710m and ten transects 2\xc3\x9750m, for a total sampled area of 0.9ha. The species count of the ten transects (442 species in 0.1ha) appears to be the highest number of species recorded with this methodology. There were 970 species for the total area (0.9ha). Ninety to ninety-five percent of the species were under 10cm dbh and 70\xe2\x80\x9386% under 2.5cm dbh, epiphytes and small trees and treelets \xe2\x89\xa410cm dbh being the most diverse growth forms. The most species-rich families and genera were those represented by herbaceous plants and treelets. Individuals were counted only in the ten 2 \xc3\x97 50 m transects (0.1 ha), where 4459 individuals were found. Palms and ferns were the most abundant growth forms. Arguments are presented against the way diversity is usually measured. Recommendations are made to include other growth forms besides trees when assessing alpha diversity for conservation purposes.'

Abstract: 'The ongoing oil spill from the blown-out well by the name of Macondo, drilled by the ill-fated rig Deepwater Horizon, has many features in common with another blowout in the Mexican Gulf that happened three decades ago. Then the oil gushed out from the Ixtoc I well drilled by the Sedco 135-F semi-submersible rig. In the years between these catastrophes, the source and nature of oil spills have undergone large changes. Huge spills from tankers that ran aground or collided used to be what caught the headlines and caused large ecological damage. The number and size of such accidental spills have decreased significantly. Instead, spills from ageing, ill-maintained or sabotaged pipelines have increased, and places like Arctic Russia, the Niger Delta, and the northwestern Amazon have become sites of reoccurring oil pollution. As for blowouts, there is no clear trend with regard to the number of incidences or amounts of spilled oil, but deepwater blowouts are much harder to cap and thus tend to go on longer and result in the release of larger quantities of oil. Also, oil exploration and extraction is moving into ever-deeper water and into stormier and icier seas, increasing potential risks. The risk for reoccurring spills like the two huge Mexican Gulf ones is eminent and must be reduced.'

Abstract: "In the Atlantic lowlands of Northeast Costa Rica, logging occurs in tracts of poorly drained wet forest ('swamp forest'), yet little is known about factors affecting swamp forest diversity or the potential for biodiversity retention during harvest. This paper quantitatively describes the species composition and diversity of the swamp forest habitat, and reports the immediate impact of controlled, selective logging on tree community diversity. Pentaclethra macroloba (Leguminosae), Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae) and Pterocarpus officinalis (Leguminosae) accounted for >70% of the primary swamp forest basal area. Nevertheless, 225 species from 53 families with individuals \xe2\x89\xa510cm dbh were encountered in 16.4 ha; most species had very low abundances. Gamma diversity is a component of overall swamp forest diversity. Extraction of 49.2m3ha\xe2\x88\x921 (5.5 trees ha\xe2\x88\x921) of timber from a 4ha plot reduced species richness by 14, supporting assertions that random mortality during logging can affect the distribution of rare species. However, tree community diversity as measured by rarefaction was not greatly affected by selective logging. Total post-logging stem recruitment over a 3-year period was greater in logged plots than in undisturbed plots; the recruitment of the ruderal species Ochroma lagopus (Bombacaceae) was the most clearly affected by logging. Any localized dominance by this species will be limited in space and time in a carefully managed forest. The results suggest that controlled selective logging can be consistent with biodiversity conservation, and complement protected areas in Northeast Costa Rica."

Abstract: 'Foraging army ants face a problem general to many animals\xe2\x80\x94how best to confront resource depletion and environmental heterogeneity. Army ants have presumably evolved a nomadic lifestyle as a way to minimize re-exploitation of previously foraged areas. However, this solution creates a challenge for an army ant colony: foraging by this colony and others creates a shifting landscape of food resources, where colonies should theoretically avoid their own previous foraging paths as well as those of other colonies. Here, we examine how colonies exploit this resource mosaic, using some of the optimality arguments first proposed and tested by Franks and Fletcher (1983), but with much larger data sets in a new location in SW Amazonia. Our data supported Franks and Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s (1983) model for systematic avoidance of raided areas during the statary phase, as well as a hypothesis of distance optimization between successive statary bivouacs. We also test and find significant evidence that foraging raids turn in opposite directions from the previous day\xe2\x80\x99s directional angles more frequently than what would be expected if turning angles were distributed at random, which acts to move a colony away from recently exploited areas. This implies that colonies follow a straighter line path during the nomadic phase as opposed to a curved one, which acts to maximize distance between statary bivouacs. In addition to intra-colony movement optimization, we examine evidence for inter-colony avoidance from more than 330 colony emigrations and suggest that colony-specific pheromones are not necessarily repulsive to other colonies. Lastly, we compare our results with those of similar studies carried out at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Despite a higher density of army ants in the SW Amazon region, colonies spend less time emigrating than their counterparts at BCI, which suggests a higher prey density in SW Amazonia.'

Abstract: 'Bird community characteristics of three sites with different levels of disturbance were studied using transect surveys during the dry season in a subtropical humid forest in Bolivia. One area had been unintentionally burned 4 years prior and selectively harvested (DIS) 1 year prior to sampling. A second area had been selectively harvested 1 year prior to sampling and had no recent history of fire (HAR). Species richness, as assessed by species\xe2\x80\x93time curves and rarefaction, was higher in both altered areas than in undisturbed forest (INT). In general, frugivores and omnivores were more abundant in both altered areas compared to intact forest. Canopy frugivores, understory omnivores and multiple-strata omnivores were most abundant in HAR. Canopy frugivores, near-ground insectivores, understory and multiple-strata omnivores were least abundant in INT, although INT had the highest abundances of canopy insectivores and near-ground omnivores. Richness and abundance of widespread species with low habitat specificity was higher in both areas that experienced disturbance compared to intact forest. Differences in bird community structure between disturbed and intact forest at this site are attributed primarily to the addition of widespread species with less narrow habitat requirements, and possibly to changes in the distribution of different food types.'

Abstract: ' Although tree-ring chronologies of  Cedrela fissilis  and  Cedrela angustifolia  showed a common climatic signal, local conditions influence growth, suggesting that forest guidelines should be appropriate to the species and context. '

Abstract: 'A widely accepted paradigm for speciation in tropical forests, the refuge theory, requires periodic habitat fragmentation driven by global climatic fluctuations to provide conditions for allopatric speciation. This implies that comparative species richness in refugia is due to loss of diverse communities in areas affected by climatic cycles. In this study we compare distribution patterns of bird and plant taxa which we consider to be of either deep phylogenetic lineages or recent radiations. It is demonstrated that lowland areas which have been postulated as Pleistocene refugia are dominated by species which represent lineages of pre-Pleistocene age. Since variations in species richness within these forest tracts reflect currently apparent environmental variables which might be considered to determine carrying capacity, we do not need to postulate that richness is the result of changes in forest cover in the past. Recently diversified taxa of plants and birds are found mainly at the periphery of the main rain forest blocks and in habitat islands outside them. Here, peak concentrations of young restricted-range species are often congruent with clusters of old and biogeographically relictual species. It is suggested that this reflects special intrinsic environmental properties of these areas, in the form of long-term environmental stability caused mainly by persistent orographic rain or mist. In this case, richness is not necessarily due to extinction outside these areas. Stability not only enables survival of relictual taxa, but also promotes morphological differentiation of radiating taxa, leading to aggregates of taxa of restricted distribution.'

Abstract: 'Mature tropical forests at agricultural frontiers are of global conservation concern as the leading edge of global deforestation. In the Ituri Forest of DRC, as in other tropical forest areas, road creation associated with selective logging results in spontaneous human colonization, leading to the clearing of mature forest for agricultural purposes. Following 1-3\xc2\xa0years of cultivation, farmlands are left fallow for periods that may exceed 20\xc2\xa0years, resulting in extensive secondary forest areas impacted by both selective logging and swidden agriculture. In this study, we assessed forest structure, tree species composition and diversity and the regeneration of timber trees in secondary forest stands (5-10 and ~40\xc2\xa0years old), selectively logged forest stands, and undisturbed forests at two sites in the Ituri region. Stem density was lower in old secondary forests (~40\xc2\xa0years old) than in either young secondary or mature forests. Overall tree diversity did not significantly differ between forest types, but the diversity of trees \xe2\x89\xa510 cm dbh was substantially lower in young secondary forest stands than in old secondary or mature forests. The species composition of secondary forests differed from that of mature forests, with the dominant Caesalpinoid legume species of mature forests poorly represented in secondary forests. However, in spite of prior logging, the regeneration of high value timber trees such as African mahoganies (Khaya anthotheca and Entandrophragma spp.) was at least 10 times greater in young secondary forests than in mature forests. We argue that, if properly managed and protected, secondary forests, even those impacted by both selective logging and small-scale shifting agriculture, may have high potential conservation and economic value.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x83Alchornea triplinervia trees occur in a montane Atlantic rainforest at the Maca\xc3\xa9 de Cima State Ecological Reserve (Nova Friburgo, RJ, Brazil). They are found in two adjacent secondary forests at distinct successional stages: a late-secondary (shaded and humid) and an early-secondary forest (drier, higher light intensities reaching the understory). Leaf samples collected in these environments were compared in regard to various anatomic parameters. Histochemical tests, anatomic measurements and counting indicated no significant variation for the basic leaf anatomy. Nevertheless, as compared to the late-secondary forest, the leaves of the early-secondary forest individuals showed an increased bulk of sclerenchyma at the main nervation and petiole, gelatinous fibers with hygroscopic walls all along the central vascular system, thicker cuticle, a higher abaxial stomatal density, abundance of tannin in the mesophyll, a significantly thicker palisade and spongy parenchyma, and compactation of the spongy parenchyma. This anatomical variation indicates an increased xeromorphism of leaves under the drier conditions of the early-secondary forest. Leaf anatomy plasticity may contribute to the high ecological plasticity of this widespread neotropical species.'

Abstract: 'This brief essay, which represents the third editorial of the series "Recollections, Reflections, and Revelations: Ethnobiologists and their First Time in the Field", captures a few memories of the author\'s first fieldwork in the Venezuelan rainforest. It is a collage of objects, subjects, feelings, spaces, and events that pendulate in spheres of meaning straddling between the author\'s identities as both a student and a woman. The author\'s evocations of fifteen years ago are diluted in lasting reflections about what could be ethnoecology embraced by spaces of interactions and associations between organisms and their surroundings.'

Abstract: 'The knowledge of the biogeochemical cycle of chlorine (Cl)is important since this element is used as a tracer of geochemical and hydrological processes in oceanic or continental environments. More specifically, Cl can be used to correct surface water composition from atmospheric contribution in order to calculate precise chemical weathering rates in watersheds. Beyond the problem of potential Cl sources in a given watershed, which is directly related to the lithology, vegetation, and industrial activities, the Cl normalization is based on the assumption that this element behaves conservatively during surface processes (e.g., chemical weathering, adsorption/desorption processes).'

Abstract: "Multistrata agroforestry systems with tree crops comprise a variety of land use systems ranging from plantations of coffee, cacao or tea with shade trees to highly diversified homegardens and multi-storey tree gardens. Research on plant-soil interactions has concentrated on the former. Tree crop-based land use systems are more efficient in maintaining soil fertility than annual cropping systems. Certain tree crop plantations have remained productive for many decades, whereas homegardens have existed in the same place for centuries. However, cases of fertility decline under tree crops, including multistrata agroforestry systems, have also been reported, and research on the causal factors (both socioeconomic and biophysical) is needed. Plantation establishment is a critical phase, during which the tree crops require inputs but do not provide economic outputs. In larger plantations, tree crops are often established together with a leguminous cover crop, whereas in smallholder agriculture, the initial association with food crops and short-lived cash crops can have both socioeconomic and biological advantages. Fertilizers applied to, and financed by, such crops can help to `recapitalize' soil fertility and improve the development conditions of the young tree crops. Favorable effects on soil fertility and crop nutrition have been observed in associations of tree crops with N2-fixing legume trees, especially under N-deficient conditions. Depending on site conditions, the substitution of legume `service' trees with fast-growing timber trees may lead to problems of competition for nutrients and water, which may be alleviated through appropriate planting designs. The reduction of nutrient leaching and the recycling of subsoil nutrients are ways to increase the availability of nutrients in multistrata systems, and at the same time, reduce negative environmental impacts. These processes are optimized through fuller occupation of the soil volume by roots, allowing a limited amount of competition between associated species. The analysis of temporal and spatial patterns of water and nutrient availability within a system helps to optimize the use of soil resources, e.g., by showing where more plants can be added or fertilizer rates reduced. Important research topics in multistrata agroforestry include plantation establishment, plant arrangement and management for maximum complementarity of resource use in space and time, and the optimization of soil biological processes, such as soil organic matter build-up and the stabilization and improvement of soil structure by roots, fauna and microflora."

Abstract: ' The Case for Borojoa patinoi in the Choc\xc3\xb3 Region, Colombia. Economic Botany 51(1): 39-48. 1997. The economic botany of the tree speciesBorojoa patinoi is presented after consulting all available literature and visiting the region.Borojoa patinoi is a noteworthy species in that it is endemic to the biogeographic Choc\xc3\xb3 region, its fruits have high market value, and it is an understory tree, which means it can be cultivated without clearing the overstory trees. This paper reviews the literature on the taxonomy and phytogeography of the genus, as well as the production ecology of the species. Two net present value models are presented to analyze the species economically. From the models, we conclude that in many areas in the Choc\xc3\xb3, plantingB. patinoi trees is likely to be economically more competitive than planting commercial timber species. Furthermore, monocultures ofB. patinoi may not be the economically optimal production system. BesidesB. patinoi, some other Choc\xc3\xb3 species with edible fruits are suggested for further research.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation in southeast Brazil has led to the extinction of Hymenaea courbaril var. stilbocarpa and ex situ conservation has been established. In this study, the levels of genetic diversity and the effective population size of H. courbaril in a germplasm bank were investigated using six nuclear microsatellite loci. A total of 79 and 91 alleles were found in 65 seed-trees and their 176 offspring, respectively. Offspring have a higher average number of alleles per locus (A\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa015.2) than seed-trees (A\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa013.2), but lower observed heterozygosity (offspring: H o\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.566; seed-trees: H o\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.607). The estimate of outcrossing rate shows that the study population is perfectly outcrossed (t  m \xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.978, P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05). Significant deviations from random mating were detected through mating among relatives and correlated matings. The average variance in effective population size for each family was 2.63, with a total effective population size retained in the bank of 170.1. These results confirm that the preserved population of H. courbaril retains substantial genetic variability. '

Abstract: 'This article traces the history of scientific ideas connecting forest cover with rainfall to inform ongoing debates about whether forests are net users or producers of water in the hydrological cycle. Scholars of the supply-side school argue that forests are net producers and magnifiers that increase rainfall at regional scales. Supply-side scholars seek to challenge the dominance of demand-side thinking. The demand-side school emphasizes that trees are net users of water within a catchment that decrease overall water available for other users. This scientific debate has significant implications for the development of policies to manage forests and water.'

Abstract: 'This study examines the effects of modeled planetary boundary layer (PBL) mixing on the simulated temperature diurnal cycle climatology over land in 20 CMIP5 models with AMIP simulations. When compared with observations, the magnitude of diurnal temperature range (DTR) is systematically underestimated over almost all land areas due to a widespread warm bias of daily minimum temperature (Tmin) and mostly a cold bias of daily maximum temperature (Tmax). Analyses of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble means suggest that the biases of the simulated PBL mixing could very likely contribute to the temperature biases. For the regions with the cold bias in Tmax, the daytime PBL mixing is generally underestimated. The consequent more dry air entrainment from the free atmosphere could help maintain the surface humidity gradient, and thus produce more surface evaporation and potentially lower the Tmax. The opposite situation holds true for the regions with the warm bias of Tmax. This mechanism could be particularly applicable to the regions with moderate and wet climate conditions where surface evaporation depends more on the surface humidity gradient, but less on the available soil moisture. For the widespread warm bias of Tmin, the widely-recognized overestimated PBL mixing at nighttime should play a dominant role by transferring more heat from the atmosphere to the near-surface to warm the Tmin. Further analyses using the high resolution CFMIP2 output also support the CMIP5 results about the connections of the biases between the simulated turbulent mixing and the temperature diurnal cycle. The large inter-model variations of the simulated temperature diurnal cycle primarily appear over the arid and semi-arid regions and boreal arctic regions where the model differences in the PBL turbulence mixing could make equally significant contributions to the inter-model variations of DTR, Tmax and Tmin compared to the model differences in surface radiative processes. These results highlight the importance and need for accurate descriptions of the PBL processes with respect to the turbulent mixing in order to improve the temperature diurnal cycle simulations in climate models.'

Abstract: 'Identification of priority conservation areas is crucial for safeguarding freshwater ecosystems. Occurrence of unique populations and/or evolutionary significant units for key species is one of the most frequent reasons for protecting a region or location. In this study we have studied two of the most important fisheries resources of the Amazon basin, Curimata and Tambaqui, from different areas, in order to identify common zones of special diversity. Employing the Barcoding cytochrome oxidase I gene as a genetic tool, we have detected a clear differentiation of the populations inhabiting the Meeting of Waters and the rest of the basin for both species. This area corresponds to the confluence of the Solim\xc3\xb5es and the Negro rivers, of different physicochemical water characteristics, at the Brazilian city of Manaus in central Amazonas. The Meeting of Waters area (near Manaus) could be recommended as a potential area subject of special management, given its apparent role as a shelter for evolutionary significant units.'

Abstract: 'Plukenetia is a small pantropical genus of lianas and vines with variably sized edible oil-rich seeds that presents an ideal system to investigate neotropical and pantropical diversification patterns and seed size evolution. We assessed the biogeography and seed evolution of Plukenetia through phylogenetic analyses of a 5069 character molecular dataset comprising five nuclear and two plastid markers for 86 terminals in subtribe Plukenetiinae (representing 20 of ~\xe2\x80\x8923 Plukenetia species). Two nuclear genes, KEA1 and TEB, were used for phylogenetic reconstruction for the first time. Our goals were: (1) produce a robust, time-dependent evolutionary framework for Plukenetia using BEAST; (2) reconstruct its biogeographical history with ancestral range estimation in BioGeoBEARS; (3) define seed size categories; (4) identify patterns of seed size evolution using ancestral state estimation; and (5) conduct regression analyses with putative drivers of seed size using the threshold model.'

Abstract: ' The kinetics of nitric oxide consumption in four tropical soils were studied under oxic and anoxic conditions in a flow-through system in the laboratory. Under anoxic conditions the soils had a very high affinity for NO, resulting in KM values of 0.02\xe2\x80\x930.27\xe2\x80\x89ppmv NO (equivalent to 0.04\xe2\x80\x930.50\xe2\x80\x89nM NO in the aqueous phase). These KM values were lower than literature values for NO consumption by denitrifying bacteria. Under oxic conditions the kinetics of NO consumption in the tropical soils were completely different, exhibiting KM values higher than 1.7\xe2\x80\x89ppmv. These higher KM values were similar to literature values for NO consumption by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. Thus, the tropical soils studied seem to contain two different NO consumption activities which can be distinguished by their kinetics and which predominate under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. However, it was not possible to quantify the contribution of each process to total NO consumption under natural conditions. Under aerobic conditions NO turnover kinetics were positively correlated with soil respiration, N mineralisation and soil organic carbon, whereas under anaerobic conditions they were positively correlated with potential and actual denitrification rates and pH.'

Abstract: 'Three fragmented rain forests and one primary forest in southern Yunnan were plotted. The microclimate and soil conditions of these forests were also studied. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) The microclimatic differences between inside and outside forest are less in the fragmented forests than in the primary forest, which indicates that the buffer effects to climatic change have been reduced in the fragmented forests. The soil has deteriorated to some extent due to forest fragmentation. (2) In species composition, especially the abundance of some species and the dominant ranks of some families have changed with fragmentation. Barringtonia macrostachya, the most dominant species in the control primary forest, disappeared from the fragmented forests, while Antiaris toxicaria, which is a characteristic but not dominant species in the primary forest, is dominant in fragmented forests. (3) The total number of species per plot was reduced in the fragmented forests and the more seriously disturbed the fragment was, the more the species richness diminished. (4) In life form spectra, the liana and microphanerophyte species increased, but epiphyte, megaphanerophyte, mesophanerophyte and chamaephyte species decreased in the fragmented forests. (5) The plant species diversity is generally lower in the fragmented forests than in the primary forest, although for some life forms it could be higher. (6) The tree species with small populations could be lost first in the process of rain forest fragmentation. (7) The heliophilous or pioneer tree species increased and the shade-tolerant species were reduced in the fragmented forests.'

Abstract: 'An understanding of the comparative nutritionalrequirements of important timber species isfundamental in the development of sustainable systemsfor the production of wood from plantations on manyinfertile, highly weathered soils in the humidtropics. We established a field experiment comparingthe responses of four highly-valued cabinet timberspecies (Cedrela odorata, Agathis robusta,Flindersia brayleyana and Castanospermumaustrale) to phosphate fertiliser on a soil very lowin chemically extractable phosphorus (4 mg P/kg soil). Similar soils derived from Palaeozoic metasedimentsare widespread throughout the humid tropics ofnorthern Australia, south-east Asia and thesouth-western Pacific, and are typical of those onmany sites available for plantation forestry in theregion. Phosphorus fertiliser treatments (rangingfrom 0 to 300 g P/tree) were applied soon afterplanting to all four species, as was a basalfertiliser dressing supplying adequate levels of allother mineral nutrients. Two species (F.brayleyana and C. australe) maintained goodgrowth even without additional P and showed little orno response in growth or foliar P concentration toincreased P supply. The other two species (C.odorata and A. robusta) responded strongly inboth growth and foliar P concentration to increasingP supply. In these responsive species, chemicalanalysis of foliage at 17 months after planting wasshown to have potential diagnostic and prognosticvalue. Phosphorus concentrations less than 0.30% drymatter (DM) in the petiole plus rachis of young matureleaves of C. odorata, and less than 0.19% DM inthe distal needle leaves of A. robusta, wereassociated with diminished growth of these two speciesboth at the time of sampling and 21 months later. Theresults indicate that there are significantdifferences in the ability of tropical tree species toacquire and use phosphorus, and consequently thatsimple prescriptive applications of phosphorusfertiliser to young plantations, irrespective of soiltype or tree species, are often inefficient.'

Abstract: "The effects of forest management on vegetation structure and capture frequencies of nymphalid butterflies were studied in a logged rain forest in south-east C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire. An experimental compartment, where liberation thinning was carried out 3 years before, and a 5-year-old mono-dominant tree plantation were compared to a regenerating control compartment; 3642 specimens of 97 species were trapped. Accumulated species richness and diversity indices were lower in the control compared to the liberation thinning compartment, but lowest in the plantation. However, the habitat preference for traps situated in the control compartment was negatively correlated with the size of the species geographical range. Four out of five species with a lower capture frequency in the liberation thinning compartment showed preferences for mature succession stages and were either Upper Guinean endemics or Guinea\xe2\x80\x93Congolian\xe2\x80\x93restricted species. The seven species with higher capture frequencies in the liberation thinning compartment were all geographically widespread. Five of them showed higher frequencies in younger succession stages. Eight species, three canopy specialists and two Guinea savannah species, significantly preferred the plantation, while 17 species avoided this management type. Liberation thinning seems to affect the more specialised species with smaller geographic ranges, thus risking loss of regional diversity."

Abstract: 'Changing the landscape has serious environmental impacts affecting the ecosystem services, particularly in the tropics. In this paper, we report changes in ecosystem services in relation to land use and land cover over an 18-year period (1988\xe2\x80\x932006) in the Menglun Township, Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. We used Landsat TM/ETM and Quickbird data sets to estimate changes in ten land use and land cover categories, and generalized value coefficients to estimate changes in the ecosystem services provided by each land category. The results showed that over the 18-year period, the land use and land cover in the study area experienced significant changes. Rubber plantations increased from 12.10% of total land cover to 45.63%, while forested area and swidden field decreased from 48.73 and 13.14 to 27.57 and 0.46%, respectively. During this period, the estimated value of ecosystem services dropped by US $11.427 million (\xe2\x88\xbc27.73%). Further analysis showed that there were significant changes in ecological functions such as nutrient cycling, erosion control, climate regulation and water treatment as well as recreation; the obvious increase in the ecological function is provision of raw material (natural rubber). Our findings conclude that an abrupt shift in land use from ecologically important tropical forests and traditionally managed swidden fields to large-scale rubber plantations result in a great loss of ecosystem services in this area. Further, the study suggests that provision of alternative economic opportunities would help in maintaining ecosystem services and for an appropriate compensation mechanisms need to be established based on rigorous valuation.'

Abstract: 'The spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) is a threatened species in many areas of its western North American range. Concomitant with its decline has been a rapid invasion of its range and habitat by barred owls (Strix varia), a native species that was restricted, until relatively recently, to eastern North America. We assess the theoretical potential for negative interactions between these two owls by examining size dimorphism and ecological relationships within various owl assemblages throughout the world. We then review the anecdotal, natural history, modeling, and experimental evidence that suggest barred owls may negatively affect spotted owls with at least a potential for the competitive exclusion of spotted owls by barred owls throughout all or part of the former\xe2\x80\x992019;s range. While it is widely accepted that barred owls are either causing or exacerbating declines of spotted owl populations, there are confounding factors, such as habitat loss and bad weather that also may contribute to declines of spotted owls. Both theory and empirical information suggest that barred owls are likely to have negative effects on spotted owl range and density, but the degree of the impact is not predictable. There is a conservation conundrum here, in that the barred owl is a native species that has expanded its range westwards, either naturally or with a degree of human facilitation, and now constitutes a major threat to the viability of another native species, the threatened spotted owl. We propose that only through carefully designed experiments involving removal of barred owls will we be able to determine if recent declines in spotted owl populations are caused by barred owls or by other factors. It is rare in conservation science that replicate study areas exist for which we also have long-standing demographic information, as is the case with the spotted owl. Removal experiments would take advantage of the wealth of data on spotted owls, and allow ecologists to assess formally the impacts of an invasive species on a threatened species, as well as to suggest mitigation measures.'

Abstract: 'Existing at the interface of land and sea, in regions of low topographic relief, mangroves are likely to be some of the first ecosystems that undergo spatial modification due to sea-level rise. The mangrove ecosystems of the Gulf of Papua New Guinea are some of the largest and most pristine in the Asia\xe2\x80\x93Pacific region; they have not been subject to clearance for crustacean farming nor suffered from land reclamation projects. This article establishes through analysis of a time series of aerial photography and satellite imagery from the period 1973\xe2\x80\x932007, that there have been substantial changes in the distribution of mangroves in this region. These changes include the seaward progradation of the Purari Delta and the regression of the Kikori Delta by an average of 43\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 at its most seaward point. While these findings are likely to be continuations of long-term trends, it is probable that they can be explained by a variety of interacting factors including climate change, sea-level rise, subsistence in the northern Gulf of Papua and changes in sediment dynamics.'

Abstract: 'An extended study of the 972 forest butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea) in Africa west of the Dahomey Gap, covering the period 1990\xe2\x80\x932006, showed that 97% of all species ever recorded from the area were still present in one or more of the remaining forests within the region. This is despite the fact that during the past 150 or so years the forests have shrunk to 13% or less of their original extent, very little of which in pristine condition. The 34 species not recorded during the study period mainly belong to genera and species-groups that are rare, local, or difficult of access\xe2\x80\x94species that any collector would be lucky to find once in a lifetime. A few may actually be \xe2\x80\x9cphantom species\xe2\x80\x9d or mislabelled butterflies from other parts of Africa. Effectively it seems that no butterfly has yet gone regionally extinct in West Africa. Two-thirds of the 34 species not recorded between 1990 and 2006 were found elsewhere in Africa. This should be a source of pride and encouragement for all concerned with nature conservation in the region. The long-term survival of fauna and flora is wholly dependent on the continued existence of sufficient broadleaf forest in reasonable condition. It is possible that accumulated \xe2\x80\x9cextinction debt\xe2\x80\x9d will still lead to loss of species, a process that should be closely monitored. The remaining area of forest of high quality is small, fragile and now contained almost exclusively within the formal protected areas systems: its continued conservation is vital. Many challenges still exist and much hard work remains to consolidate the conservation of West African biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'We studied the tree communities in primary forest and three different land use systems (forest gardens, ca. 5-year-old secondary forests, cacao plantations) at 900\xe2\x80\x931200 m elevation in the environs of Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi. The primary forests had ca. 150 tree species \xe2\x89\xa510 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) per hectare, which is unusually high for forests at this elevation in southeast Asia. Basal area in the primary forest was 140 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921, one of the highest values ever recorded in tropical forests worldwide. Tree species richness declined gradually from primary forest to forest gardens, secondary forests, and cacao plantations. This decline was paralleled by shifts in tree family composition, with Lauraceae, Meliaceae, and Euphorbiaceae being predominant in primary forests, Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae and Myristicaeae dominating in the forest gardens and Euphorbiaceae, Urticaceae, and Ulmaceae in the secondary forests. Cacao plantations were composed almost exclusively of cacao trees and two species of legume shade trees. Forest gardens further differed from primary forests by a much lower density of understorey trees, while secondary forests had fewer species of commercial interest. Comparative studies of birds and butterflies demonstrated parallel declines of species richness, showing the importance of trees in structuring tropical forest habitats and in providing resources.'

Abstract: 'Borneo contains a diverse rainforest butterfly community, but its forests are under threat from logging and ENSO- (El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation) induced fires. Contrasts in butterfly assemblage structure were examined in nine 450 ha landscapes in logged forest, primary unburned continuous and isolated forest, and forest affected by surface fires during the 1997/98 ENSO event. Temporally the effect of the 1997/98 ENSO event was followed in a single burned landscape from 1997 to 2004. In total, 517 species were present in 190 sampling sites. There was a five-fold difference in species richness among landscapes, with highest richness in continuous landscapes and lowest richness in burned landscapes. Richness was also higher in logged forest than proximate unlogged forest. Temporally, species richness dropped dramatically from 1997 to 1998, but afterwards increased remaining, however, substantially lower than pre-ENSO (1997) sampling. Sites in burned landscapes were distinct from other sites in terms of vegetation structure with the slash-and-burn area the most dissimilar to other landscapes. There was much less structure among unburned landscapes. The pattern of butterfly community composition was similar to that of vegetation structure with the community from the slash-and-burn area the most distinct. However, there was much less overlap among sites from different landscapes. Temporally, 1998 possessed the most distinct assemblage when compared to assemblages from other years. The community composition was, however, slowly returning to a pre-disturbance composition. Variance in community composition explained by environmental and spatial factors differed substantially among landscapes. The spatial fraction was the only explanatory component in recently burned landscapes and a proximate small unburned isolate, but explained no variation in logged landscapes. The environmental fraction explained substantial amounts of variation in logged landscapes and the slash-and-burn area. When all landscapes were pooled high proportions of variation in butterfly community composition were explained by both geographic distance between sites and environmental variables. In contrast when only unburned landscapes were considered, most variation was explained by the geographic distance among them. Despite differences among landscapes there was a general pattern of relatively sharp decline in similarity at short distances that levels out over greater distances, a result that agrees with previous studies on other tropical species assemblages.'

Abstract: 'The Congo Basin encompasses the second largest rainforest area after the Amazon but the Congo Basin rainforest has been more preserved during the last decades with a much lower deforestation rate. At the same time, the region remains one of the least developed in the world. We use the partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM for the global agricultural, forestry and bioenergy sectors that seeks to find optimal land use options by spatially representing land qualities. We show the trade-offs between achieving agricultural growth at the expense of forests and protecting forests at the expense of agriculture development in the Congo Basin. The realization of the transportation infrastructures, which are already planned and funded, could multiply deforestation by three. In contrast, a global agreement on reduction of total emissions from deforestation could achieve important cuts in GHG emissions from deforestation in the Congo Basin. However, it could lead to substantial increases in food imports and food prices, which are in contradiction with the food security objectives.'

Abstract: 'More than 1200 vascular plant species, distributed over 369 genera and 112 families were encountered in ten plots of 0.1 ha in the humid evergreen rain forests of the middle Caquet\xc3\xa1 area in eastern Colombia. The total number of vascular plant species in the two most diverse plots ranged from 310 to 313 species 0.1 ha-1. These values indicate that high levels of vascular plant species densities may be encountered all over NW Amazonia, including the Colombian Amazon. The floodplain plots contained fewer vascular plant species and families than the well-drained upland plots. The high species density in the well-drained upland plots was mostly due to comparatively large numbers of species found among the very slender trees of diameter at breast (DBH)\xe2\x89\xa42.5 cm. Small and slender treelets (DBH < 10 cm) are by far the most species rich habit group. About 50% of the total number of vascular plant species in the plots was exclusively collected with a diameter of less than 2.5 cm. Shrubs, (hemi)epiphytes, and climbers were present with relatively few species. Many of the most species-rich families were tree families. The highest species richness was principally found among tree genera, as well. In this respect the floristic sample from the ten species count plots combined shows much affinity to the local florula around Manaus.'

Abstract: 'The relationship between diet and biomass was examined in the Amazonian ungulates (red brocket deer, grey brocket deer, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary, and lowland tapir) of Northeastern Peru. Tropical forest ungulates have lower biomasses than savanna or grassland ungulates, because in tropical forests the majority of primary production occurs in the canopy, well out of reach from terrestrial herbivores. Within the Amazonian ungulates, species that supplement their diet with animal material, namely the peccaries, obtain a greater crude and metabolic biomass, and higher reproductive rates than the purely herbivorous species. Omnivory appears to help terrestrial herbivores inhabiting closed canopy forests overcome some effects of food limitation.'

Abstract: 'Biomass of a mature man-made forest in West Java, Indonesia, was estimated to evaluate the carbon sequestration potential of plantation forest in the humid tropics. Twenty plots, each 0.25\xe2\x80\x89ha in area and containing one to six planted species over 40 years of age and with closed canopies, were selected. Trunk dry mass was estimated from trunk diameter, tree height, and bulk density. Maximum trunk diameter (122\xe2\x80\x89cm) was observed in a 46-year-old Khaya grandifoliola C. DC. tree, and the tallest tree (51\xe2\x80\x89m) was a 46-year-old Shorea selanica (DC.) Blume. The largest trunk biomass (911\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921) was achieved in the plot composed of two Khaya spp. Among the plots composed of indigeneous Dipterocarpaceae species, the largest trunk biomass was 635\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921. These trunk biomasses were larger than those reported from primary rainforests in Southeast Asia (e.g., 403\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921 in East Kalimantan, 522 and 368\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Peninsular Malaysia). The large biomass in this forest suggests that, given favorable conditions, man-made forests can accumulate the quantities of atmospheric carbon that were lost by the logging of primary forests in the humid tropics.'

Abstract: 'Landscape ecology focuses on the spatial patterns and processes of ecological and human interactions. These patterns and processes are being altered by both changing resource-management practices of humans and changing climate conditions associated, in part, with increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Dominant resource-extraction and land-management activities involve energy, and the use of fossil energy is one of the key drivers behind increasing greenhouse gas emissions as well as land-use changes. Alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, nuclear, and bioenergy) are being explored to reduce greenhouse gas emission rates. Yet, energy production, including alternative-energy options, can have a wide range of effects on land productivity, surface cover, albedo, and other factors that affect carbon, water, and energy fluxes and, in turn, climate. Meanwhile, climate influences the potential output, relative efficiencies, and sustainability of alternative energy sources. Thus, land use, climate change, and energy choices are linked, and any comprehensive analysis in landscape ecology that considers one of these factors should be cognizant of these interactions. This analysis explores the implications of linkages between land use, climate hange, and energy and points out ecological patterns and processes that may be affected by their interactions.'

Abstract: 'Accurate estimates of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) are critical for the development of realistic models of plant productivity. However, in many areas such as the vast Amazon region of South America, there have been few empirical studies of PAR. Here, we analyzed the relationship between PAR and broadband solar irradiance (R s) and formulated models to estimate PAR in two experimental sites (pasture and forest) in the Brazilian Amazon. Three different models of increasing complexity were developed based on information from R s (model 1), R s and clearness index (k t; model 2), and R s, k t, and water vapor pressure (model 3). Estimates of PAR were generated for each season and for the entire year. All models had very high determination coefficients and indices of agreement for both pasture and forest sites. This strongly supports the use of R s and k t to produce robust estimates of PAR. The results obtained by annual models were close than that found by seasonal models, demonstrating that a single annual model is able to estimate PAR, albeit with lower accuracy.'

Abstract: 'Nutrient limitation of primary production was experimentally assessed using an in situ bioassay technique in the Quebrada Salto, a third-order tropical stream draining the northern foothills of the Cordillera Central in Costa Rica. Bioassays employed artificial substrata enriched with nutrients that slowly diffuse through an agar-sand matrix (Pringle & Bowers, 1984). Multiple comparisons of regression coefficients, describing chlorophyll-a accrual through time for different nutrient treatments, revealed positive micronutrient effect(s). Micronutrient treatment combinations (Fe, B, Mn, Zn, Co, Mo, EDTA), supplemented with and without nitrate and phosphate, exhibited significantly greater chlorophyll-a accrual over all other treatments (P < 0.05), supporting over three times that of the control after 14-d of substratum colonization. Neither of the major nutrients (N or P) produced a significant stimulation, although the N treatment displayed \xe2\x89\x8350% more chlorophyll-a than the control after 14-d. Similarly, Si, EDTA, and Si + N + P treatments did not exhibit chlorophyll-a response curves that were significantly different from the control. During the experiment, mean NH4-N and (NO2 + NO3)-N concentrations in the Salto were 2.0 \xc2\xb5M (28.6 \xc2\xb5g \xc2\xb7 l\xe2\x88\x921) and 7.2 \xc2\xb5M (100.2 \xc2\xb5g \xc2\xb7 l \xe2\x88\x921), respectively. High concentrations of PO4-P (\\(\\bar X\\) = 2.0 \xc2\xb5M; 60.9 \xc2\xb5g \xc2\xb7 l\xe2\x88\x921) and TP (\\(\\bar X\\) = 3.0 \xc2\xb5M; 94.0 \xc2\xb5g \xc2\xb7 l\xe2\x88\x921) were also found, and consequently low molar N:P ratios \\(\\bar X\\) = 4.7). Despite the potential for N limitation in the system, both N and P appear to be at growth saturating levels. This may be due to micronutrient limitation and/or light limitation of periphyton growth in densely shaded upstream portions of the stream.'

Abstract: 'Data on farming systems in Pet\xc3\xa9n, Guatemala, were used to develop an agricultural intensity index. The index can be used to assign an intensity \xe2\x80\x9cscore\xe2\x80\x9d to a given farming system based on the array of practices used by the farmer, each practice\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to production intensity, and the scale at which these practices are used. The scores assigned to 118 farmers in three study areas in Pet\xc3\xa9n were analyzed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify the factors that account for the variation in intensity levels, as measured through the index. The analyses reveal that the factors influencing agricultural intensity in Pet\xc3\xa9n vary greatly from one study area to the next. This is due to differences in livelihood opportunities and strategies that, in turn, affect how agriculture fits into the local economy and how and why intensification is pursued. Variation in intensity levels can best be understood by considering the factors at the household and sub-regional scales that influence (a) whether farmers feel a need to intensify, (b) whether they see some benefit in doing so, and (c) whether they have the resources required to intensify production through particular strategies. Close attention must be paid to these factors by conservation and development organizations seeking to influence land use patterns and conserve forest in Pet\xc3\xa9n.'

Abstract: 'IPCC predictions indicate an increase in temperatures by 1.5\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xb0C in some Amazonian regions during the twenty-first century. These changes could disrupt the present distribution patterns of organisms, including wetland plant species. In this work, we determined in microcosms the effects of scenarios combining elevated temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration on the germination and initial growth of the arborescent Amazonian aquatic macrophyte Montrichardia arborescens. Seeds were germinated, and seedlings produced were monitored over a 5-month period in four microcosms: Control: ambient temperature and CO2 level; Mild: Control\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa01.5\xc2\xb0C and\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0200\xc2\xa0ppm CO2; intermediate: control\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa02.5\xc2\xb0C and\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0400\xc2\xa0ppm CO2; Extreme: Control\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa04.5\xc2\xb0C and\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0850\xc2\xa0ppm of CO2. Rapid light response curves and Fv/Fm values taken in seedlings showed a decrease in electron transportation rate with CO2 and temperature elevation. Mild and Intermediate treatments stimulated biomass production; Extreme treatment and Control produced similar results. The severe climatic changes expected in the future may negatively influence carbon accumulation in M. arborescens. Since aquatic macrophytes in Amazonian wetlands and wetlands worldwide are key plant species, further studies are needed to predict their fate in a global change perspective.'

These trunk biomasses were larger than those reported from primary rainforests in Southeast Asia (e.g., 403\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921 in East Kalimantan, 522 and 368\xe2\x80\x89Mg\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Peninsular Malaysia). The large biomass in this forest suggests that, given favorable conditions, man-made forests can accumulate the quantities of atmospheric carbon that were lost by the logging of primary forests in the humid tropics.'

Abstract: 'Leptodactylus paraensis Heyer, is a Neotropical anuran species that inhabits Rainforest habitats in the eastern Amazon, but because it has only been recently separated from the Leptodactylus pentadactylus (Laurenti) species group, little is known about its helminth fauna. This study describes a new species of Oswaldocruzia Travassos, 1917 and records the first occurrence of this genus parasitising L. paraensis and the second species for the Caxiuan\xc3\xa3 National Forest in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. Oswaldocruzia lanfrediae n. sp. is characterised by having an anterior extremity with a smooth cephalic vesicle divided into two portions, a claviform oesophagus, well-developed cuticular longitudinal ridges and lateral alae. Females have a well-developed ovojector, with didelphic and amphidelphic uteri. Males show complex robust spicules divided into a slightly curved shoe, a bifurcated fork and a blade terminating in 2\xe2\x80\x933 processes. The new species differs from its congeners especially regarding the lateral alae and the morphology of the spicules, in addition to morphometric characters such as body size, oesophagus length, deirid position, nerve-ring position and relative position of the vulva in females.'

Abstract: 'A floristic inventory of woody plants was conducted in the tropical forest vegetation of Indigenous Territory and National Park Isiboro-S\xc3\xa9cure, Bolivia. All stems with a diameter at breast height \xe2\x89\xa52.5\xc2\xa0cm were sampled in two terra firme and two floodplain 0.1\xc2\xa0ha forest transects, resulting in a total of 447 species and 1,564 individuals. Results correspond fairly well with other Bolivian and neotropical studies in terms of species distribution patterns, physiognomy, family distribution, growth forms, as well as species and family richness. Our finding that only 6% of all species occurred in all four transects, while 69% was found in only one transect, supports the hypothesis that Amazonian plant communities are dominated by a limited set of species, whereas the large majority of species follows a patchy distribution. However, Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s Alpha index values were much higher than was expected from literature data. It is hypothesized that this might be related to high local precipitation levels and/or natural and (historical) anthropogenic disturbance regimes. Although much more research is necessary, our results suggest that TIPNIS represents a strongly underestimated local center of plant diversity.'

Abstract: 'Habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation are widespread drivers of biodiversity decline. Understanding how habitat quality interacts with landscape context, and how they jointly affect species in human-modified landscapes, is of great importance for informing conservation and management.'

Abstract: 'The accumulation of scientific knowledge is far outstripped by the rate of environmental disturbance from human activities in aquatic habitats. This highlights the need to develop effective proxy measures of aquatic biodiversity that can demonstrate changes in communities associated with human activities. We evaluated whether the relative abundance and species richness of Anisoptera and Zygoptera can be used as a tool to measure environmental impacts on Amazonian streams. Adult of Anisoptera and Zygoptera were sampled in 50 Amazonian streams, in the municipality of Paragominas (Par\xc3\xa1 state), Brazil, using an entomological handnet. The physical features of each stream were evaluated using an index of environmental integrity (HII). We collected a total of 1769 Odonata specimens, representing 97 species (56 were Zygoptera and 41 were Anisoptera). Habitat modification resulted in an inversion in the proportional abundance and species richness of Anisoptera and Zygoptera, where Zygoptera diversity decreased with the loss of habitat integrity, whereas Anisoptera diversity increased with habitat disturbance. A decline of 0.1 in the habitat integrity index score resulted in an increase of approximately 13 individuals and 11 species of Anisoptera, with the exact opposite effect observed for the Zygoptera. In summary, the Odonata proved to be a useful model for the assessment of Amazonian streams, with sites where more than 54% of the Odonata species were Zygoptera being classified as preserved, and those dominated by Anisoptera species (>\xe2\x80\x8959%) being considered degraded. This approach has clear applications for environmental impact assessments, as it reduces the influence of sampling effort and collector experience on assessment outcomes, and does not rely upon specialist knowledge, given that members of the two suborders are easily distinguished from one and other in the field.'

Abstract: '\nThis study examines the variability of annual-mean precipitation in eight AOGCMs and in observations using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). The leading mode of precipitation variability in both models and observations is centered around the low-latitude western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, and is associated with the El Ni\xc3\xb1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The spatial pattern R 2 correlations between model and observed EOF1 range from 0.12 to 0.61. In the observations, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is highly correlated (R 2 = 0.82) with the amplitude of precipitation EOF1, while model R 2 correlations range from 0.17 to 0.83. If grid points near to those used to compute the standard SOI are used to compute alternative SO indices, the correlation with the amplitude of EOF1 ranges from 0.40 to 0.90 when based on the index that maximizes the correlation. Spatial fields of the variation between local precipitation and the SOI or the North Atlantic Oscillation Index are also computed for each model and compared with the observed fields. The model fields have many important similarities with the observed fields.'

Abstract: 'The regeneration of natural vegetation (fallowing) is a traditional practice for restoring fertility of agricultural land in many parts in the tropics. As a result of increasing human population and insufficient fertilizer inputs, the ecosystem fertility functions of traditional fallows must now be improved upon via the use of managed fallows. Interactions between vegetation and soil determine nutrient losses and gains in crop\xe2\x80\x94fallow systems and are influenced by fallow species, patterns and rates of biomass allocation, and crop and fallow management. Nutrient losses occur through offtake in crop harvests during the cropping phase and through leaching, runoff, and erosion in the cropping phase and the initial stage of fallows $#x2014; when nutrient availability exceeds nutrient demand by vegetation. Gains in nutrient stocks in later stages of fallow are generally more rapid on soils with high than low base status due to greater quantities of weatherable minerals and lack of constraints to N2 fixation, deep rooting, and retrieval of subsoil nutrients by fallow vegetation. On low base status soils (exchangeable Ca < 1 cmolc kg\xe2\x88\x921), N2 fixation and atmospheric inputs are likely to be the main sources of nutrient additions. On high base status soils limited by N, gains in N stocks by inputs from N2 fixation and retrieval of subsoil nitrate can occur relatively rapidly; hence short-term fallows can often improve crop performance. Large losses of Ca associated with soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization and soil acidification during cropping and fallow establishment, combined with chemical barriers to root penetration, suggest that long-duration fallows (> 5 yr) are needed for recovery of cation stocks and crop performance on low base status soils. On both soils, however, residual benefits of fallows on crop yields usually last less than three crops.'

Abstract: ' Elaeis oleifera has become a valuable genetic resource for the production of interspecific hybrids of E. oleifera (H.B.K) Cort\xc3\xa9s \xc3\x97 Elaeis guineensis Jacq. to address plant disease problems affecting oil palm cultivation. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic and genetic diversity of accessions of E. oleifera from different countries in South America using morpho-agronomic traits and microsatellite markers (Simple Sequence Repeats, SSRs). Analyses of variance for yield and bunch components demonstrated statistically significant differences among countries and geographical regions for several of the traits evaluated. SSR marker analyses revealed high genetic diversity (H  T \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.797) and the presence of specific alleles by each country of origin from E. oleifera. The clustering topology obtained showed four distinguishable E. oleifera groups, which matched the geographical distribution of the accessions and thus exhibited a high genetic differentiation (G  ST \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.512) and a low gene flow N  m \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.238 among countries. The results enabled us to demonstrate that E. oleifera has a specific genetic structure and a phenotypic variability with different characteristics between origins, and the accessions from each country of origin contributed to the increase in total genetic diversity. A core collection was defined based on the accuracy of the classification of individuals with respect to their country of origin. The information reported in this study will be of great interest to oil palm researchers because new strategies for breeding programs can be developed based on these advances.'

Abstract: 'Forest degradation is a global phenomenon and while being an important indicator and precursor to further forest loss, carbon emissions due to degradation should also be accounted for in national reporting within the frame of UN REDD+. At regional to country scales, methods have been progressively developed to detect and map forest degradation, with these based on multi-resolution optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and/or LiDAR data. However, there is no one single method that can be applied to monitor forest degradation, largely due to the specific nature of the degradation type or process and the timeframe over which it is observed. The review assesses two main approaches to monitoring forest degradation: first, where detection is indicated by a change in canopy cover or proxies, and second, the quantification of loss (or gain) in above ground biomass (AGB). The discussion only considers degradation that has a visible impact on the forest canopy and is thus detectable by remote sensing. The first approach encompasses methods that characterise the type of degradation and track disturbance, detect gaps in, and fragmentation of, the forest canopy, and proxies that provide evidence of forestry activity. Progress in these topics has seen the extension of methods to higher resolution (both spatial and temporal) data to better capture the disturbance signal, distinguish degraded and intact forest, and monitor regrowth. Improvements in the reliability of mapping methods are anticipated by SAR-optical data fusion and use of very high resolution data. The second approach exploits EO sensors with known sensitivity to forest structure and biomass and discusses monitoring efforts using repeat LiDAR and SAR data. There has been progress in the capacity to discriminate forest age and growth stage using data fusion methods and LiDAR height metrics. Interferometric SAR and LiDAR have found new application in linking forest structure change to degradation in tropical forests. Estimates of AGB change have been demonstrated at national level using SAR and LiDAR-assisted approaches. Future improvements are anticipated with the availability of next generation LiDAR sensors. Improved access to relevant satellite data and best available methods are key to operational forest degradation monitoring. Countries will need to prioritise their monitoring efforts depending on the significance of the degradation, balanced against available resources. A better understanding of the drivers and impacts of degradation will help guide monitoring and restoration efforts. Ultimately we want to restore ecosystem service and function in degraded forests before the change is irreversible.'

Abstract: 'Monsoon is now considered as a global system rather than regional phenomena only. For over 300 years, monsoon has been viewed as a gigantic land-sea breeze, but now satellite and conventional observations support an alternative hypothesis which considers monsoon as a manifestation of seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and, hence, a climate system of the global scale. As a low-latitude climate system, monsoon exists over all continents but Antarctica, and through all the geological history at least since the Phenorozoic. The time is ripe for systematical studies of monsoon variations in space and time.'

Abstract: 'A large number of people in developing countries have traditionally depended on products derived from plants, especially from forests, for curing human and livestock ailments. Additionally, several aromatic plants are popular for domestic and commercial uses. Collectively they are called medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs). About 12.5% of the 422 000 plant species documented worldwide are reported to have medicinal values; but only a few hundred are known to be in cultivation. With dwindling supplies from natural sources and increasing global demand, the MAPs will need to be cultivated to ensure their regular supply as well as conservation. Since many of the MAPs are grown under forest cover and are shade tolerant, agroforestry offers a convenient strategy for promoting their cultivation and conservation. Several approaches are feasible: integrating shade tolerant MAPs as lower strata species in multistrata systems; cultivating short cycle MAPs as intercrops in existing stands of plantation tree-crops and new forest plantations; growing medicinal trees as shade providers, boundary markers, and on soil conservation structures; interplanting MAPs with food crops; involving them in social forestry programs; and so on. The growing demand for MAPs makes them remunerative alternative crops to the traditional ones for smallholders in the tropics. Being underexploited species with promising potential, the MAPs require research attention on a wide array of topics ranging from propagation methods to harvesting and processing techniques, and germplasm collection and genetic improvement to quality control and market trends. Joint forest management with farmers and contract farming with drug companies with buyback arrangement will promote cultivation of medicinal plants.'

Abstract: 'Human depletion of soil and wood resources is dramatically altering the biodiversity of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This paper provides an overview of the numerous linkages between the depletion of soil and wood resources and the loss of biodiversity. While some of these linkages are well documented, others remain speculative or unexplored. In order to understand the full ramifications of resource depletion on biodiversity, additional research is required.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated the directional asymmetry between right and left wings and quantified the intraspecific and interspecific variation of the wing shape of 601 specimens of the genus Diachlorus to determine to what extent the geometrical variation discriminates six species distributed in six protected areas of Colombia. Geometric analyses were performed, integrating Procrustes methods, principal component analyses, cluster analyses, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, and evaluations of shape changes. In Diachlorus, left and right wings did not present significant asymmetry but a geometrical analysis was allowed for species identification and, in some cases, the origin of the specimens using the variation of wing shape; the best-assigned species was Diachlorus leticia Wilkerson & Fairchild, while the worst was Diachlorus jobbinsi Fairchild, which also had the highest intraspecific variation, while Diachlorus fuscistigma Lutz had the lowest variation. Diachlorus fuscistigma and Diachlorus leucotibialis Wilkerson & Fairchild were the most similar species, while D. leucotibialis and Diachlorus nuneztovari Fairchild & Ortiz were the most disimilar. The specimens with the most different wing shape belonged to Choc\xc3\xb3 (especially those of D. jobbinsi), the geographically farthest area from the others in the study; however, no correlation was observed between geometric and geographical distances. Linear discriminants were better than nonlinear (quadratic) discriminant analyses in predicting species membership, but the opposite was true for predicting area membership. Based on our data, we hypothesized that other species of Diachlorus could also be discriminated using geometric morphometry of the wing shape.'

Abstract: "Any attempts to preserve Third World ecosystems must recognize that the ultimate decisions lie with the governments of these sovereign states, which have to deal with widespread demands for higher living standards as well as growing populations. To deal with the powerful pressures of economic growth, the most promising strategy for conservationists is to press the Western industrialized states, where the conservation movement is relatively strong, to join with the Third World in an international agreement whereby the latter would preserve portions of threatened ecosystems in exchange for compensation provided from the industralized countries, most plausibly through an agreement to reduce Third World countries' debt. To reinforce this protection, the industrialized states could agree to purchase tropical ecosystem products only from those states which agree to preserve certain portions of their ecosystems. While there would be great problems both in working out the levels of compensation and in persuading the industrialized states to participate in such a scheme, intensive lobbying by conservation groups might be enough to bring it to fruition."

Abstract: ' A theoretical framework and conceptual model for temporal stability of forest tree-species composition was developed based on a synthesis of existing studies. The model pertains primarily to time periods of several tree lifetimes (several hundred to a few thousand years) at the neighborhood and stand spatial scales (0.01\xe2\x80\x9310 ha), although a few extensions to the landscape scale are also made. The cusp catastrophe was chosen to illustrate compositional dynamics at the stand level for jack pine, northern hardwood, and white pine forests in the Great Lakes Region of the United States and for tropical rainforests in the northern Amazon basin. The models feature a response surface (degree of dominance by late-successional species) that depends on two variables: type of neighborhood effects of the dominant tree species and severity of disturbances. Neighborhood effects are processes that affect the chance of a species replacing itself at the time of disturbance (they can be positive, neutral, or negative) and are of two types: overstory\xe2\x80\x93undestory effects, such as the presence of advanced reproduction; and disturbance-activated effects, such as serotinous seed rain. Disturbance severity is the proportion of trees killed during a disturbance. Interactions between neighborhood effects and disturbance severity can lead to either punctuated stability (dramatic but infrequent change in composition, in those forests dominated by species with positive neighborhood effects) or succession (continuous change, in those forests dominated by species with neutral-negative neighborhood effects). We propose that neighborhood effects are a major organizing factor in forest dynamics that provide a link across spatial scales between individual trees and disturbance/patch dynamics at the stand and landscape scales.'

Abstract: "This chapter reviews available data on thermal conditions prevailing in lotic ecosystems of the Southern Hemisphere. The primary factors (hydrology, climate, insolation) that interact to determine the thermal r\xc3\xa9gime are examined in the context of southern waters. Maximum temperatures are plotted against annual ranges for equatorial (0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xb0 latitude), tropical (10\xe2\x80\x93231/2\xc2\xb0 latitude), and temperate sites. In regions with seasonal climates, running waters exhibit diel and annual thermal periodicity patterns, the phasing of which varies between and within lotic systems. The universality of Illies' river zonation system is analyzed in the context of thermal conditions in Southern Hemisphere running waters."

Abstract: 'First generic chromosome counts reveal the base number x=7 for the generaTetrameranthus andRollinia. T. umbellatus from the Peruvian Amazon is diploid (2n=14),T. duckei from Brazil (Manaus) is tetraploid (2n=28). In the NeotropicsRollinia (7 species counted) has developed diploid to octoploid taxa (2n=14, 28, 42, 56). Counts of 7 South AmericanAnnona species are presented for comparison (2n=14, 28). The West AfricanCleistopholis patens has 2n=14. The Asian genusMezettia: 2n=14 and the neotropicalGuatteria tribe: 2n=28 are also revised. A detailed karyomorphological comparison, including karyotypes, banding patterns, condensing behaviour of chromosomes and structure of interphase nuclei reveals that the closely related generaAnnona andRollinia are almost identical in their diploid genomes, whereas the polyploid ones differ in their heterochromatin (=hc) composition and number of NO-chromosomes.Cleistopholis, Mezettia and theGuatteria tribe are karyologically and systematically distinct from each other and fromAnnona/Rollinia. Tetrameranthus as compared with the karyomorphology of about 60 other Annonaceous genera has a very peculiar and unusual karyomorphology which underlines its isolated position. Nuclear structures are almost identical in the African genusUvariopsis (2n = 16) and partly similar in theGuatteria tribe; both also share some morphological similarities and possibly are related. From a comparison ofTetrameranthus with several nuclear types within theMagnoliidae, a new model of chromosome evolution in primitive Angiosperms is suggested. In respect to their eco-morphological differentiation the genera investigated differ strongly from each other.'

Abstract: 'The contribution of throughfall and stemflow as pathways for solute inputs into the forest floor in four mature forests in northwest Amazonia was investigated. Total solute inputs, resulting from the changes of atmospheric deposition after rainfall passes through the forest canopy, are presented in the form of throughfall and stemflow nutrient inputs and their possible sources are discussed. Throughfall is by far the most important solute input into the forest floor of the forests studied. On average, it represents about 98% of the total solute inputs. Although trends in solute enrichment varied among the forests, there is a general tendency in all ecosystems towards a distinct enrichment of SO4, K, Cl, NO3 and NH4 in throughfall and stemflow and a small increase of protons, Mn, orthoP and Fe. When comparing the net enrichment between the forests, the relative increase of solutes in throughfall and stemflow was higher in the flood plain and low terrace than in the high terrace and sedimentary plain forests. While highest values for total cation inputs were observed in the flood plain, the low terrace showed the highest value for total inorganic anions. The length of the antecedent dry period was the main factor affecting throughfall and stemflow composition, concentrations increasing with increasing length. A second, less important factor was the amount of throughfall and stemflow, which showed a poor and negative correlation with solute concentrations. The increased activity of frugivores in the canopy during fruiting periods seemed to lead to temporary increased solute concentrations in throughfall and stemflow as a result of the wash off of deposited faecal materials and detritus in the canopy. Leaching from leaves and wash off of exudes, of solutes deposited on the foliage after evaporation of intercepted rainfall and of dry deposited materials were all found to contribute to the concentration of solutes in the throughfall and stemflow. Gross rainfall enrichment after passing the forest canopy, mainly by nutrient leaching, is considerably lower than the amounts of nutrients released in litterfall implying a tight nutrient cycling and nutrient conserving mechanisms by forests studied.'

Abstract: 'Although the creation of edges during forest fragmentation can have important abiotic and biotic impacts, especially under conditions of future climate change, mechanistic models of edge effects have not been forthcoming. A simple numerical model of two-dimensional heat flow is developed and applied to a vertical forest/clearcut edge profile and to simulated fragmented landscapes. Height-specific thermal diffusivity and conductivity in the forest were assumed to vary in proportion to foliage densities measured in the central Amazon. In the edge profile, the clearcut that abutted the edge served as a heat source and its temperature was maintained at a constant value higher than in the initially cooler forest. In the fragmented landscapes, simulated treefall gaps were heat sources whose temperature varied with sun movements during the day. Gap frequency was varied so as to approximate the gap coverage observed in selectively logged forests. In one set of simulations, temperature in the openings was systematically varied; in another, thermal diffusivity of the forest was varied. Along the edge profile, high temperatures in the clearcut were rapidly transmitted into the upper canopy due to additive edge effects. Temperatures in the forest understory were also very sensitive to clearcut temperatures due to relatively sparse understory foliage. An overall increase in forest diffusivity led to markedly higher temperatures close to the edge and a more even temperature distribution among height strata. In fragmented landscapes, total gap coverage and additivity from neighboring gaps strongly influenced forest temperatures. At low conductivities, heat flowed only into the forest close to the gaps and hence forest temperature increased almost linearly with gap area. However, at high conductivities, heat flowed far into the forest and forest temperature varied as a function of gap density in the surrounding neighborhood. Because of these additive effects, slight increases in total gap area led to disproportionate changes in the thermal profile of the landscape. These results have important implications for the conservation of forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'In natural environments, distinct species interact with differing level of specialization, and thereby generate complex interaction networks. Recent studies have shown that certain antagonistic and mutualistic networks have a highly modular structure. This indicates that within an ecological network, densely connected semi-independent compartments occur and reflect different levels of the structural and functional system. Despite strong evidence for the existence of a modular structure in obligate and symbiotic networks involving ants and myrmecophytes, it is still uncertain whether these networks are modular. Here, we used the modularity index (M) to evaluate whether symbiotic ant\xe2\x80\x93myrmecophyte networks exhibit a modular pattern of interactions. The analyses were based on a large data set of ant\xe2\x80\x93myrmecophyte networks collected in mature and secondary forests of the Brazilian Central Amazon. Our results indicate that symbiotic ant\xe2\x80\x93myrmecophyte networks are highly modular (M\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.53\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.13) regardless of forest type. Using other network descriptors, we found no difference in links per species (Links\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.68\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.15) and network connectance (C\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.31\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.17) among the different types of forest. Furthermore, the composition of ants and myrmecophytes did not differ among forest types (ANOSIM; P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05), reinforcing the idea that this symbiotic interaction can be resistant to different local and landscape environmental factors. In summary, this study contributes to a better understanding of the way biodiversity is organized in obligate and symbiotic ant\xe2\x80\x93plant mutualisms.'

Abstract: 'Interactions of indigenous peoples with the surrounding non-indigenous society are often the main sources of social and environmental changes in indigenous lands. In the case of the Suru\xc3\xad in Brazilian Amazonia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9carc of deforestation,\xe2\x80\x9d these influences are leading to deforestation and logging that threaten both the forest and the sustainability of the group\xe2\x80\x99s productive systems. The Suru\xc3\xad tribal leadership has initiated a proposal for an economic alternative based on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD). This has become a key case in global discussions on indigenous participation in REDD. The realism of the baseline scenario that serves as a reference for determining the amount of deforestation and emissions avoided by the proposed project is critical to assuring the reality of the carbon benefits claimed. Here we examine the SIMSURUI model, its input parameters and the implications of the Suru\xc3\xad Forest Carbon Project for indigenous participation in climate mitigation efforts.'

Abstract: 'The Low Carbon Development Strategy proposed in June 2009 by the government of Guyana in response to the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries program has triggered evaluation of forest-related activities, thereby acting as a catalyst for improvements in Guyana\xe2\x80\x99s small- to medium-scale gold mining industry. This has also shed light on areas committed to conservation, something that has also been handled by Non Governmental Organizations. This paper compares water quality and mercury concentrations in sediment from four main areas in Guyana, two that are heavily mined for gold using mercury amalgamation methods (Arakaka and Mahdia) and two that are considered conservation areas (Iwokrama and Konashen). Fifty-three sediment and soil mercury loadings ranged from 29 to 1,200\xc2\xa0ng/g and averaged 215 \xc2\xb1 187\xc2\xa0ng/g for all sites with similar averages in conservation and mining areas. Sediment loadings are within the range seen in French Guiana and Suriname, but conservation area samples had higher loadings than the corresponding uncontaminated baselines. Type of ore and location in the mining process seemed to influence mercury loadings. Mercury sediment loadings were slightly positively correlated with pH (correlation coefficient = 0.2; p value < 0.001) whereas no significant correlations were found with dissolved oxygen or turbidity.'

Abstract: 'Multivariate statistics are used to investigate sensitivity of the tropical atmospheric circulation to scenario-based global land cover change (LCC), with the largest changes occurring in the tropics. Three simulations performed with the fully coupled Parallel Climate Model (PCM) are compared: (1) a present day control run; (2) a simulation with present day land cover and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 greenhouse gas (GHG) projections; and (3) a simulation with SRES A2 land cover and GHG projections. Dimensionality of PCM data is reduced by projection onto a priori specified eigenvectors, consisting of Rossby and Kelvin waves produced by a linearized, reduced gravity model of the tropical circulation. A Hotelling T 2 test is performed on projection amplitudes. Effects of LCC evaluated by this method are limited to diabatic heating. A statistically significant and recurrent signal is detected for 33% of all tests performed for various combinations of parameters. Taking into account uncertainties and limitations of the present methodology, this signal can be interpreted as a Rossby wave response to prescribed LCC. The Rossby waves are shallow, large-scale motions, trapped at the equator and most pronounced in boreal summer. Differences in mass and flow fields indicate a shift of the tropical Walker circulation patterns with an anomalous subsidence over tropical South America.'

Abstract: 'Biogeographical studies in Amazonia have commonly taken a historical, rather than an ecological approach. General patterns have been sought in the distribution maps of different species, and these have been explained in terms of past or present distribution barriers, especially past climates and large rivers. Implicitly, and often also explicitly, it is assumed that Amazonia is ecologically so uniform that present-day ecological conditions are rather insignificant in determining species distribution patterns and speciation. However, this assumption is more based on the lack of relevant data than on actual observations of environmental uniformity or ecological unspecialization of the species. Recent studies have indeed documented ecological heterogeneity and floristic differences among sites that were previously thought similar. In the absence of direct knowledge of the past, more complete ecological and environmental understanding of the present-day Amazonia are needed for evaluating the relative roles of historical and ecological factors in Amazonian biogeography and biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Data shortfalls on species distribution affect species differently, but it is frequent among insects. Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools to fill biogeographic deficits and provide support for practical conservation actions, particularly for cryptic or hard to survey species. We employed SDMs to evaluate one such species, the long-horned beetle (Macrodontia cervicornis), listed as \xe2\x80\x98vulnerable\xe2\x80\x99 in the IUCN\xe2\x80\x99s Red List of Threatened Species. Given new distributional data for this species, we applied three different SDMs to: (1) provide the first assessment of this species\xe2\x80\x99 distribution and potential dispersal routes; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the current South American protected areas system for its conservation; and (3) discuss its potential distribution, as well as historical, biogeographical, and taxonomic issues related to it. Our models reached fair True Skilled Statistics values (TSS\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.5), with the core area for M. cervicornis located in the Amazon forest, although suitable areas were also predicted along the Atlantic forest. Areas in the dry diagonal South American corridor (dry biomes of Cerrado, Caatinga, and Pampas) in South America were not predicted as suitable. The preference of M. cervicornis for humid areas with high temperatures may guarantee a better physiological control for dehydration, considering that large insects are more affected by water loss. In general, approximately 15\xc2\xa0% of the distribution of M. cervicornis is in humid protected areas. The disconnected distribution of the long-horned beetle may be an indication of the existence of cryptic species under the same classification. We suggest that similar studies with other insect groups (e.g. butterflies, bees) should be conducted to properly assess their distributions, conservation status, and responses to hot-humid gradients throughout South America.'

Abstract: 'The butterfly assemblages of pairs of forest habitats, differing in disturbance level, within the Victoria Mayaro reserve of South-East Trinidad, are described using walk-and-count transects and canopy and understorey fruit traps. The concurrent use of these two butterfly censusing techniques, revealed major but conflicting differences in species accumulation rates under different disturbance conditions. The disturbed evergreen habitat had the significantly highest accumulation rate from walk-and-count data but the significantly lowest from fruit trap data. This reflects the specificity of much of the fruit-feeding guild for closed canopy forest. Disturbed habitats were found to lack a distinct canopy fauna. These results are discussed in light of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Within a region of forest, butterflies were found to be more characteristic of a disturbance level than of a particular forest type, lending weight to the belief that butterfly faunas can be used as bioindicators of forest disturbance. Several restricted geographic range species were not adversely affected by forest disturbance, at these levels of disturbance. The butterfly censuses in this study suggest that the optimal strategy for safeguarding butterfly species richness under natural forest management regimes would be to maintain a mosaic of habitats that included areas of undisturbed primary forest and a network of other forest patches, that varied in management regime and level of disturbance.'

Abstract: 'Species composition, diversity and tree population structure were studied in three stands of the tropical wet evergreen forest in and around Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh, India. Three study stands exposed to different intensities of disturbances were identified, viz., undisturbed (2.4\xc2\xa0ha) in the core zone of the park, moderately disturbed (2.1\xc2\xa0ha) in the periphery of the park and highly disturbed (2.7\xc2\xa0ha) outside the park area. In total 200 plant species belonging to 73 families were recorded in three stands. Tree density and basal area showed a declining trend with the increase in disturbance intensity. The densities of tree saplings and seedlings were lower in the disturbed stands than in the undisturbed stand. Species like Altingia excelsa, Olea dioica, Terminalia chebula, Mesua ferrea and Shorea assamica in the undisturbed stand and Albizia procera alone in the moderately disturbed stand contributed more than 50% of the total tree density in respective stands. The undisturbed stand contained young tree population. In the highly disturbed stand, the tree density was scarce, but had uncut trees of higher girth class (>210\xc2\xa0cm GBH). Low shrub density was recorded in both disturbed stands due to frequent human disturbances; the broken canopy and direct sunlight enhanced the abundance of herbs in these stands. With a species rarity (species having <2 individuals) of ca. 50%, the tropical wet evergreenforests of the Namdapha National Park and its adjacent areas warrant more protection from human intervention and also eco-development to meet the livelihood requirements of the local inhabitants in the peripheral areas of the Namdapha National Park in order to reduce the anthropogenic pressure on the natural resources of the park.'

Abstract: 'Sexual systems play a key role in the ecology and evolution of plant populations. Research on Garcinia L. has shown the occurrence of variations in the sexual systems of this genus, with some authors considering it as dioecious, and for some species as gynodioecious or androdioecious. The population of G. brasiliensis in the restinga of Maric\xc3\xa1 is dioecious with two individuals characterized as monoecious. Anatomical analysis showed that one has pistillate and sterile staminate flowers, being an unusual female and the other has staminate and perfect flowers (functional pollen grains and ovules), being andromonoecious. In addition, field observations, controlled hand-pollinations, reproductive phenology and anatomical analysis showed no evidence of apomixis in this Neotropical species, different from that provided in the literature for paleotropical species. However, asexual reproduction occurs through ramets suggesting that in this environment of restinga the seedlings are subjected to considerable limitations, and vegetative propagation becomes an important alternative for the occupation of the environment. Flowering episodes occurred throughout the study period, featuring a subannual and long-lasting flowering pattern mainly due to multiple blooms of male plants. The floral characters observed in G. brasiliensis are often associated with a generalist pollination system. Apis mellifera and Trigona spinipes are the effective pollinators of G. brasiliensis flowers. Our findings provide new insights into the reproductive biology of Garcinia.'

Abstract: 'The tactics of shifting cultivation are reviewed with particular reference given to techniques of forest regeneration. The desirability of a forest-fallow system of agriculture is explained. Also discussed are the causes, indicators, and consequences of a breakdown of forest-fallow cultivation. In conclusion, the future of tropical forests for agriculture and habitats for man is considered.'

Abstract: 'This paper investigates the process of coalition formation for issue-specific coalitions. I use the Alliance of Small Island States and the Coalition for Rainforest Nations as case studies to inductively create a framework on coalition formation. This framework is tested against two coalitions, both advocating for mountain issues in the UN climate negotiations. These two coalitions differ in the type of coalition sought, the strategies deployed thus far, and the type of support they have received, including the role of non-state actors. The framework helps identify significant gaps in the efforts of the two coalitions, including capturing the most salient link between climate change and mountains, translating technical input into negotiating positions, and identifying the most appropriate form of the coalition and forum to pursue these interests. In doing so, this paper provides insights into the limits of linking issues to the climate change agenda (\xe2\x80\x9cclimate bandwagoning\xe2\x80\x9d), issue proliferation and its implications for coalition management for actors like the Group of 77 and China, and the nature of multi-scalar interactions in regime complexes.'

Abstract: 'With diversification of field type among households in same eco-environment and social situation, even in the same ecosystem, merging household socio-economics with biodiversity initiative values to determine incentives and optimum strategy of on-farm conservation of biodiversity. Botany survey of agroecosystems at landscape level in Daka and Baka, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China, as well as household differentiation of biodiversity in agroecosystem and on-farm conservation strategy merging household socio-economic characters were studied. There were 73 families 179 species distributed in 0.1\xc2\xa0ha of different agroecosystems in Daka, and 70 families 166 species distributed in 0.08\xc2\xa0ha different agroecosystems of Baka respectively. The cosmopolitan families, such as Gramineae and Compositae decreased the percentage of tropical families and subtropical families. Botany survey among 12 random selected households from Daka in 46 sampling plots of different agroecosystems showed significant differentiation of the species richness indices of natural biodiversity and agrobiodiversity as there were differences of cognition and utilization of plant species besides management practices among households. Dengrogram using the Ward method of hierarchical cluster analysis based on annual questionnaire interview of 60% household from 1998 to 2001 in Daka showed disparity among different households\xe2\x80\x99 socio-economics which underpins management diversity. There were significant correlation coefficients between household socio-economics and species richness indices of different agroecosystems. Fallow size had significant positive correlation coefficients with species richness index of rubber plantation. By contraries, production input had negative correlation coefficients with species richness index of upland rice field. Meanwhile, cereal crop income had significant positive correlation coefficient with agro-species richness index of rubber plantation. By contraries, other income such as off-farm income had negative correlation coefficients with agro-species richness index of rubber plantation. Innovations of the expert farmer on agrobiodiversity on farm conservation were admiration.'

Abstract: 'The competence of two fungal isolates for degrading petroleum hydrocarbons was evaluated. The filamentous fungi were isolated from a crude oil-contaminated soil in northeastern Ecuador, and were 99\xc2\xa0%\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0% similar in 18S rDNA sequence to the genus Geomyces. Their efficiencies of degradation were tested in vitro for 30\xc2\xa0days, using medium and soil microcosm. Residual hydrocarbons were tracked by gas liquid chromatography with a flame ionization detector. The maximum removal percentages of total petroleum hydrocarbons were 77.3\xc2\xa0% and 79.9\xc2\xa0% for experiments in the medium and soil microcosm, respectively. The percent germination of cow pea (Vigna unguiculata) seeds was increased from 20\xc2\xa0% to 100\xc2\xa0% upon bioremediation. Isolates sporulated optimally on minimal salts agar medium at pH 5, 25\xc2\xb0C temperature, 1\xc2\xa0%\xe2\x80\x931.5\xc2\xa0% substrate (crude oil) and 4\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 N\xe2\x80\x93P\xe2\x80\x93K.

Abstract: 'Late Holocene vegetation, climate and fire dynamics of mountain forest and paramo ecosystems, as well as human impact, are presented from the upper Rio San Francisco valley, southeastern Ecuadorian Andes. Palaeoenvironmental changes, inferred from three soil monoliths, spanning an altitudinal gradient between 1,990 and 3,200\xc2\xa0m and the high resolution multi-proxy sediment record from Laguna Zurita (2,590\xc2\xa0m), were investigated by pollen, spore and charcoal analyses, in combination with XRF- and magnetic susceptibility-scanning. Three of the four pollen records show a marked change in the floristic composition between ca. 900 and 350\xc2\xa0cal b.p. (interpolated age). Past fires have strongly influenced the floristic composition of the mountain rainforest ecosystem. Frequent fires, together with the relatively high occurrence of grasses and some Zea mays plantations document past human activities in the upper Rio San Francisco valley. A large number of areas of probably ancient Z. mays cultivation in the upper Rio San Francisco valley has been identified, using GIS-based calculation. High occurrences of Cyperaceae and Isoetes indicate the development of marshy lake shores in response to a lower lake level at Laguna Zurita before ca. 700\xc2\xa0cal b.p. The decrease of Isoetes and Cyperaceae after ca. 1200\xc2\xa0cal b.p. reflects a lake level rise, due to increasing moisture and/or human activities.'

Abstract: 'Efforts to clarify the affinities of the tor\xc3\xb3s or brush-tailed rats (Isothrix) and document the radiation of these distinctive echimyids have been limited. The discovery of a new Andean species prompted a reanalysis of Isothrix and its relatives. Prior morphological analyses of skulls, mandibles, teeth, and external characters permitted robust diagnosis but offered little resolution of within- or between-group relationships. Analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences (798\xc2\xa0bp), which are available for numerous echimyids, confirm the monophyly of recognized genera, including Isothrix, and resolve a number of interspecific relationships. Strikingly, the Andean tor\xc3\xb3 (Isothrix barbarabrownae) is consistently recovered as sister to the remaining species. These are allied into three clades: I. sinnamariensis + I. pagurus in the lower Amazon Basin and Guianan Shield, I. orinoci + I. negrensis in the Rio Negro and R\xc3\xado Orinoco drainages, and I. bistriata across much of the western and southern Amazon Basin. However, the addition of a new basal taxon does not aid in identifying the sister taxon of Isothrix. These relationships are confirmed in combined analyses of cyt-b with sequence variation in the mitochondrial control region (D-loop; 450\xc2\xa0bp) and in the nuclear RAG1 gene (1,072\xc2\xa0bp). Analyses identify the Andes, or proto-Andes, as an important theater for the group\xe2\x80\x99s evolution and may offer an explanation for the luxuriant fur of this genus. However, neither the biogeographic history of Isothrix nor the remarkable pelage evolution of the Echimyidae can be understood until the deeper nodes within the arboreal spiny rats (Echimyinae) are more fully resolved.'

Abstract: 'We measured concentrations of soil nutrients (0\xe2\x80\x9315 and 30\xe2\x80\x9335 cm depths) before and after the dry season in control and dry-season irrigated plots of mature tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in central Panama to determine how soil moisture affects availability of plant nutrients. Dry-season irrigation (January through April in 1986, 1987, and 1988) enhanced gravimetric soil water contents to wet-season levels (ca. 400 g kg\xe2\x88\x921 but did not cause leaching beyond 0.8 m depth in the soil. Irrigation increased concentrations of exchangeable base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+), but it had little effect on concentrations of inorganic N (NH4+C, NO3\xe2\x88\x92 and S (SO42\xe2\x88\x92). These BCI soils had particularly low concentrations of extractable P especially at the end of the dry season in April, and concentrations increased in response to irrigation and the onset of the rainy season. We also measured the response of soil processes (nitrification and S mineralization) to irrigation and found that they responded positively to increased soil moisture in laboratory incubations, but irrigation had little effect on rates in the field. Other processes (plant uptake, soil organic matter dynamics) must compensate in the field and keep soil nutrient concentrations at relatively low levels.'

Abstract: "Within the framework of IDAF (IGAC DEBITS AFRICA: International GlobalAtmospheric Chemistry/DEposition of Biogeochemically Important TraceSpecies/Africa) network, data analysis is realised on precipitation chemical composition collected in Zo\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9, in Southern Cameroon. This station, located atabout 200 km from the Atlantic Ocean, is representative of a so-called `Evergreen Equatorial Forest' ecosystem. An automatic wet-only precipitation collector was operated at the station from 1996 to 2000. The rainfall regime, associated with eastward advection of moist and cool monsoon air masses, amounts to an average of 1700 mm/year. Inorganic and organic content of the precipitation were determined by IC in 234 rainfall events, representing a total 4,583 mm of rainfall from an overall of 7,100 mm.The mean annual precipitation chemistry and wet deposition fluxes characteristic of an African equatorial forest are quantified. Typical atmospheric gases and particles sources influence the precipitation chemical content and the associated deposition of chemical species. Indeed, hydrogen concentration is the highest (12.0 \xce\xbc eq.L\xe2\x88\x921) of the IDAF measurements, leading to acid rains with a low mean pH 4.92. The mineral species are dominated by nitrogenous compounds (NH4+:10.5 and NO3\xe2\x88\x92: 6.9 \xce\xbc eq.L\xe2\x88\x921), Ca2+ (8.9 \xce\xbc eq.L\xe2\x88\x921) and SO42 \xe2\x88\x92 5.1 \xce\xbceq.L\xe2\x88\x921. Relationship between Ca2 + and SO42 \xe2\x88\x92 indicated aterrigeneous particulate source and an additional SO42 \xe2\x88\x92 contributionprobably due to swamps and volcano emissions. Na+ and Cl\xe2\x88\x92concentrations, around 4.0 \xce\xbc eq.L\xe2\x88\x921, seem very low for this site,accounting for the marine source. Besides, strong correlations between NH4+/K+/Cl\xe2\x88\x92 indicate the biomass burning originof these species. Accordingly, precipitation chemistry in Zo\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9is influenced by three major sources: biogenic emissions from soil and forest ecosystems, biomass burning from savannah, and terrigenous signature from particles emissions of arid zones; and three minor sources: marine, volcano and anthropogenic. In spite of the relatively low concentration of all these elements, the wet deposition is quite significant due to the high precipitation levels, with for example a nitrogenous compounds deposition of 34 mmol.m\xe2\x88\x922.yr\xe2\x88\x921."

Abstract: "Forest inventories are largely neglected in the debate of national parks selection in Guyana (and probably elsewhere). Because taxonomic data are often scant and biased towards are as of high collecting effort, large scale forest inventory data can be a useful tool adding to a knowledge database for forests. In this paper the use of forest inventories to select national parks in Guyana is assessed. With the data of a large scale inventory five forest regions could be distinguished and two were added on the base of existing other information. Forest composition in Guyana is largely determined by geology at a national level and soil type at regional level. Species diversity is higher in the south of Guyana, possibly due to higher disturbance and is also higher on the better soils. It is concluded that a selection of national parks in Guyana should include a sample of all seven regions, including as much soil variation as possible. Because of land use conflicts in central Guyana, this area is in need of quick attention of Guyana's policy makers."

Abstract: 'Given a large collection of co-evolving online activities, such as searches for the keywords \xe2\x80\x9cXbox\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cPlayStation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWii\xe2\x80\x9d, how can we find patterns and rules? Are these keywords related? If so, are they competing against each other? Can we forecast the volume of user activity for the coming month? We conjecture that online activities compete for user attention in the same way that species in an ecosystem compete for food. We present EcoWeb, (i.e., Ecosystem on the Web), which is an intuitive model designed as a non-linear dynamical system for mining large-scale co-evolving online activities. Our second contribution is a novel, parameter-free, and scalable fitting algorithm, EcoWeb-Fit, that estimates the parameters of EcoWeb. Extensive experiments on real data show that EcoWeb is effective, in that it can capture long-range dynamics and meaningful patterns such as seasonalities, and practical, in that it can provide accurate long-range forecasts. EcoWeb consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and execution speed.'

Abstract: 'Prior field studies of Alouatta showed the highest frugivory in A. belzebul. During 10 mo between October 1999 and October 2000, we studied the feeding ecology of a group of 7\xe2\x80\x939 red-handed howlers (Alouatta belzebul discolor) in a primary forest on the banks of a tributary of the Teles Pires River, near Parana\xc3\xadta, MT, Brazil (9\xc2\xb034\xe2\x80\xb2S; 56\xc2\xb019\xe2\x80\xb2W). The howlers used 3 types of habitat: upland (terra firme) forest, flood plain forest (igap\xc3\xb3) and palm forest (a\xc3\xa7aizal). During 45 complete days of observation, the group fed on 67 plant species (N = 2039 feeding records) in 24 families. The 2 most used families were Leguminosae and Moraceae, with 17 species each. Fruits predominated (40\xe2\x80\x9380%) in every month, except June, when young leaves accounted for 54% of the diet. Dialium guianense (Leguminosal, Caesalpinioideae) was the most consumed species. Flower (6%) and mature leaf (5%) consumptions were low. Tree bark, live and decayed wood, and woody twig monthly consumption varied from 0 to 26%, and occurred only in igap\xc3\xb3, where they used mostly Macrolobium acaciaefolium (Leguminosae, Caesalpinioideae), Clitoria amazonum (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae) and Licania cf. canescens (Chrysobalanaceae). Our study on Alouatta belzebul discolor complements the high frugivory in A. b. belzebul and documents uncommon dietary items for the species. Although there is intraspecific variation in howler diets and new studies have shown higher frugivory for more folivorous species, Alouatta belzebul seems to be the most frugivorous howler species, in spite of its wide geographical distribution and, in this case, sympatry with Ateles chamek, a frugivore.'

Abstract: 'Deposition of suspended sediments andtheir associated nutrients were estimated during theflood event of 1995 in the seasonally flooded forestsof the Mapire and Caura Rivers, two black-watertributaries of lower Orinoco, and on two islands ofthis white-water river. The deposition spanned a widerange from 0.07 kg m\xe2\x88\x922 in the depositional barforests of the Mapire River to 73.60 kg m\xe2\x88\x922 onthe flooded forests of the Orinoco Island site calledJarizo. This variation is associated with the dynamicnature of sediment mobilization, transport anddeposition, as well as with the different geomorphicenvironments and erosion processes upstream from thestudy sites. The deposited sediment in all the studyareas was highly quartzitic with a relatively highcontent of kaolinite and goethite. Only in thesediment of the Orinoco Islands was mica (illite)identified in a relatively high proportion. Thesemineralogical results reflect the intense weatheringprocesses in the catchment areas of the study rivers.The chemical composition of the deposited sedimentsshowed a great variability among the different studyareas, which is in part related to the mineralcomposition of the sediments and their particle sizedistribution. The highest concentrations of K, Caand Mg were found on the clay sediments of the Orinocoagricultural island. The total amount of depositednutrients varied over a wide range, which isinfluenced by the amount of deposited sediments. Inthe Jarizo Island site of lower Orinoco were depositedthe largest amount of nutrients. In the floodedforests of the Mapire River, the nutrient contributionby the deposited sediments to the nutrient cycling isrelatively low in the depositional-bar forests andpractically nonexistent in the forests sites onterraces.'

Abstract: 'Among the 13 Mico species recognized by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, six are listed as \xe2\x80\x9cData Deficient\xe2\x80\x9d. The geographic range of most of the Mico species has been estimated from only a few records. We report new localities and the geographic extension of Mico chrysoleucos. In addition, we confirmed the presence of the species in two distinct protected areas. We modeled the habitat suitability of M. chrysoleucos using the maximum entropy method and including new records obtained by the authors in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. From the total area of occurrence calculated for the species, 22.8% is covered by protected areas and indigenous lands. The annual mean deforestation rate estimated between 2000 and 2015 was 2.95%, and the total area deforested by 2015 was 3354\xc2\xa0km2 or 8.6% of the total distribution limits of the species. The habitat lost between 2000 and 2015 was 3.2% (1131\xc2\xa0km2) of the total potential distribution, while the habitat loss area legally protected was 31\xc2\xa0km2, and the habitat loss in settlements was equal to 691\xc2\xa0km2. Our results extend the geographic distribution of the species about 100\xc2\xa0km farther south, with the Maracan\xc3\xa3 River being a possible geographic barrier for the species. The significantly low rate of habitat loss inside protected areas and indigenous land, when compared to unprotected areas, points out the importance of these areas to M. chrysoleucos conservation. The species is relatively wide-ranging, legally protected, and resilient to regional anthropic threats. However, the hydroelectric schemes and the improvement of the road system in southern Amazonia pose an imminent threat to the species.'

Abstract: 'A simple and reliable method for the determination of mercury in hair on a rotating gold disk electrode using subtractive anodic stripping voltammetry without removal of oxygen is reported. Voltammetric and microwave parameters were optimized to obtain the best analytical results. Parameters such as supporting electrolyte concentration, influence of chloride in the Hg peak, deposition potential, scan rate, accumulation time, rotation rate, square-wave amplitude, and electrode conditioning were studied. Pressurized microwave-assisted digestion of hair, suitable for the accurate voltammetric determination of Hg, was evaluated using six acid mixtures and several time-power programs. Under the optimized conditions, no interference by copper, cadmium, lead, nickel, manganese, iron, or zinc was found at concentrations corresponding to their occurrence in normal hair. A calibration plot between 6,67 and 46,69 \xce\xbcg/L was linear, with r 2 better than 0.999. The detection limit for a deposition time of 60 s at 25g, was calculated as 1.92 nM (3\xcf\x83). Validation of the method was demonstrated with the use of a certified reference sample of hair. Eight real samples of hair (four unexposed children and four exposed persons) were also analyzed.'

Abstract: 'Rodentia comprises 42\xc2\xa0% of living mammalian species. The taxonomic identification can be difficult, the number of species currently known probably being underestimated, since many species show only slight morphological variations. Few studies surveyed the biodiversity of species, especially in the Amazon region. Cytogenetic studies show great chromosomal variability in rodents, with diploid numbers ranging from 10 to 102, making it difficult to find chromosomal homologies by comparative G banding. Chromosome painting is useful, but only a few species of rodents have been studied by this technique. In this study, we sorted whole chromosome probes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from two Hylaeamys megacephalus individuals, an adult female (2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8954) and a fetus (2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8950). We made reciprocal chromosome painting between these karyotypes and cross-species hybridization on Cerradomys langguthi (2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8946). Both species belong to the tribe Oryzomyini (Sigmodontinae), which is restricted to South America and were collected in the Amazon region. Twenty-four chromosome-specific probes from the female and 25 from the fetus were sorted. Reciprocal chromosome painting shows that the karyotype of the fetus does not represent a new cytotype, but an unbalanced karyotype with multiple rearrangements. Cross-species hybridization of H. megacephalus probes on metaphases of C. langguthi shows that 11 chromosomes of H. megacephalus revealed conserved synteny, 10 H. megacephalus probes hybridized to two chromosomal regions and three hybridized to three regions. Associations were observed on chromosomes pairs 1\xe2\x80\x934 and 11. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a telomeric probe revealed interstitial regions in three pairs (1, 3, and 4) of C. langguthi chromosomes. We discuss the genomic reorganization of the C. langguthi karyotype.'

Abstract: 'Restoring species-rich tropical forests is an important activity because it helps mitigate land deforestation and degradation. However, scientific understanding of the ecological processes responsible for forest restoration is poor. We review the literature to synthesize the current state of understanding of tropical forest restoration from a biogeochemical point of view. Aboveground biomass and soil carbon accumulation of restored tropical forests are a function of age, climate, and past land use. Restored forests in wet life zones accumulate more biomass than those in moist or dry life zones. Forests restored on degraded sites accumulate less aboveground biomass than forests restored on pastures or agricultural land. Rates of aboveground biomass accumulation in restored forests are lower than during natural succession, particularly during the first decades of forest establishment. Rates of litterfall, biomass production, soil carbon accumulation, and nutrient accumulation peak during the first few decades of restored forest establishment and decline in mature stages. Changes in species composition and canopy closure influence the rate of primary productivity of older restored stands. Species composition also influences the rate and concentration of nutrient return to the forest floor. The ratio of primary productivity to biomass is high in young restored forests and low in mature stands irrespective of climate. The ratio is low when past land use has little effect on biomass accumulation, and high when past land uses depresses biomass accumulation. This effect is due to a high rate of litterfall in restored forests, which helps restore soil by circulating more nutrients and biomass per unit biomass accumulated in the stand. The degree of site degradation and propagule availability dictates the establishment and growth of tree species. Reestablishment of forest conditions and the enrichment of sites by plant and animal species invasions lead to faster rates of succession, aboveground primary productivity, and biomass accumulation in restored forests. Our review demonstrates that nutrient cycling pathways and nutrient use efficiency are critical for interpreting the suitability of tree species to different conditions in forest stands undergoing restoration.'

Abstract: 'The Negro River is located in the Amazon basin, the largest hydrological catchment in the world. Its water is used for drinking, domestic activities, recreation and transportation and water quality is significantly affected by anthropogenic impacts. The goals of this study were to determine the presence and concentrations of the main viral etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis, such as group A rotavirus (RVA) and genogroup II norovirus (NoV GII), and to assess the use of human adenovirus (HAdV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) as viral indicators of human faecal contamination in the aquatic environment of Manaus under different hydrological scenarios. Water samples were collected along Negro River and in small streams known as igarap\xc3\xa9s. Viruses were concentrated by an organic flocculation method and detected by quantitative PCR. From 272 samples analysed, HAdV was detected in 91.9\xc2\xa0%, followed by JCPyV (69.5\xc2\xa0%), RVA (23.9\xc2\xa0%) and NoV GII (7.4\xc2\xa0%). Viral concentrations ranged from 102 to 106 GC L\xe2\x88\x921 and viruses were more likely to be detected during the flood season, with the exception of NoV GII, which was detected only during the dry season. Statistically significant differences on virus concentrations between dry and flood seasons were observed only for RVA. The HAdV data provides a useful complement to faecal indicator bacteria in the monitoring of aquatic environments. Overall results demonstrated that the hydrological cycle of the Negro River in the Amazon Basin affects the dynamics of viruses in aquatic environments and, consequently, the exposure of citizens to these waterborne pathogens.'

Abstract: 'The regeneration of integrity and tissue homeostasis after injury is a fundamental property and involves complex biological processes fully dynamic and interconnected. Although there are medications prescribed to accelerate the process of wound healing by reducing the exaggerated inflammatory response, comes the need to search for different compounds of Amazonian biodiversity that can contribute to the acceleration of the healing process. Among these products, the copaiba oil-resin is one of the most prominent feature in this scenario, as they have been reported its medicinal properties.'

Abstract: 'Malaria is a major public health problem worldwide. In Brazil, an average of 420,000 cases of malaria have been reported annually in the last 12\xc2\xa0years, of which 99.7\xc2\xa0% occurred in the Amazon region. This study aimed to analyse the distribution of malaria in the State of Amazonas and the influence of indigenous malaria in this scenario, to evaluate the correlation between incidence rates and socio-economic and environmental factors, and to evaluate the performance of health surveillance services.'

Abstract: 'The United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC), at its thirteenth meeting in 2005 (COP-11), agreed to start a work program to explore a range of policy approaches and positive incentives for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD). This process was further encouraged in the 2007 COP-13 with the explicit consideration of REDD activities as a means to enhance mitigation action by developing countries in the future. This paper outlines the context of this ongoing political process by reviewing the science indicating that land-use change is a key contributor of greenhouse emissions globally and the assumptions that REDD activities may be competitive\xe2\x80\x94in terms of cost effectiveness\xe2\x80\x94in comparison to other mitigation options. The paper then examines REDD proposals submitted by Parties before COP-13 and identifies key economic, technological, methodological and institutional challenges associated with their implementation. These proposals are discussed in the light of major drivers of deforestation and ongoing efforts to address deforestation. This reveals another set of challenges which, if not taken into account, may undermine REDD effectiveness. The paper aims to aid the policy process and contribute to the best possible design of a REDD framework under the future climate regime.'

Abstract: 'Maria Luisa Mendon\xc3\xa7a discusses the current expansion of monocropping such as soybeans and sugarcane for the production of agrofuels in Brazil. She argues that in addition to environmental degradation from the indiscriminate use of natural resources, has led to both an increase in food prices and to an agricultural model based on high exploitation of workers and dependence on Trans National Companies. As a consequence, agrofuels take up some of the best agricultural lands in Brazil, displacing food production and destroying protected areas of the beauty and biodiversity of the Amazon and Cerrado.'

Abstract: 'Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Amazonian protected areas play an important role in maintaining the environmental services of the region, including Amazonia\xe2\x80\x99s role in regional and global climate. These protected areas face threats both from deforestation and from degradation of standing forest. Preserving carbon stocks in protected areas is important both because of the climatic benefit of avoiding greenhouse gas emissions and because of the potential to provide a monetary value that contributes to supporting local human populations in ways that maintain rather than destroy the forest. REDD+ represents one potential mechanism for maintaining these areas. A variety of legal threats to protected areas in Brazilian Amazonia has arisen, leading to concern over the future of these areas and their role as a bulwark against regional climate change.'

Abstract: 'The genetic diversity of 400 accessions collected in cacao farms, 95 GenBank, and 31 reference accessions was analyzed using the 12 microsatellite markers. The GenBank and reference accessions were subdivided into 12 accession groups (AG) that belong to the traditional cacao genetic groups (GG) Lower Amazon Forastero (LA), Upper Amazon Forastero (UA), Trinitario, and Criollo (Cr). The 12-microsatellite loci revealed a total of 125 alleles, 113 of which were present in the farm accession group (FA). The within and between group variation for all AGs accounted respectively for 81% and 19% of the total molecular variation. The average F is for the FA was 0.15 suggesting a moderate level of inbreeding. Significant differences for the level of gene diversity were found between the farm (0.50), GenBank (0.42 to 0.62), and reference (0.10 to 0.60) AGs. Genetic differentiation among AGs was variable with F st values varying between 0.14 and 0.57 for the different AGs. Analysis using a Bayesian model-based method showed the existence of a high level of admixture for the farm accessions group. The LA genes were most represented in the FA (54%), followed by UA (33%) and Cr (7%). The genes of LA were also the most represented in the GenBank (48%), followed by UA (24%) and Cr (14%). Only 14% and 6% of the genes of the GenBank and farm accessions, respectively, could not be attributed to any of the reference GGs. The results suggest the predominating presence of LA genes in the Cameroon farm accessions and a high level of admixture, with apparent presence of genes of more than three GGs in most accessions. The traditional Trinitario types appear to have almost disappeared from farmers fields. The admixture must be the result of hybridization and recombination of these genes from the different GGs in seed gardens and in farmers\xe2\x80\x99 fields. The use of selected farm accessions will depend on the GG that it belongs to and also on their level of heterozygosity. Further implications of the results for breeding and for introduction of new germplasm into the Cameroon GenBank are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) systems are being used in marine ecosystems as a nonextractive, cost-effective method of assessing the fish fauna with minimal species bias. This technique has had limited applications in freshwater ecosystems. Rheophilic fish assemblages of the Xingu River, a clearwater Amazonian river in Northern Brazil, were sampled with BRUV systems. Two-hour video recordings were collected using five different bait treatments (sardine, croaker, cat food, sweet corn, and no bait) in two lotic habitat categories (rocky and sandy bottoms). A total of 2460 fish from 56 taxa and 13 families were recorded from the 80 BRUV deployments. Significantly different fish assemblages, species richness, and abundance were detected between habitat types and among treatments. Our results suggest that the use of crushed sardines as a standardized bait optimizes the sampling recording the highest species richness, relative abundance, and number of exclusive species of rheophilic fish in clearwater Amazonian rivers. The data also highlight the unique fish diversity of the Xingu River prior to the expected large-scale environmental degradation resulting from the forthcoming operation of the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant.'

Abstract: 'Data on long-term research on the ecology of Central Amazonian forest streams are presented and they reveal the following basic features: Firstly, the essential input of nutrients into these waters consists of forest litter and of the fungi that decompose this litter; consequently, the bulk of the fauna is concentrated in accumulations of submerged litter. Secondly, the nutrients released by the decomposition of this litter do not appear in solution in the stream water, but are tied up throughout in the food web of the aquatic fauna. Thirdly, this food web is relatively robust. This is due to the absence of food specialists in the major channels of energy transfer. One of the staple foods for invertebrate predators consists of chironomid larvae. Fourthly, the degree of acidity and/or the content of dissolved humic substances (more or less black water) has a marked effect on the density and to a lesser extent on the species diversity of the invertebrate fauna, black waters being richer in both. Fifthly, the annual inundations of the forest in the middle and lower courses of the smaller rivers lead to drastic periodic changes of animal densities, and in some cases to annual periodicity of breeding, as exemplified by a three-year study of shrimp populations in the river \xe2\x80\x98Tarumazinho\xe2\x80\x99.'

Abstract: 'Aircraft measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) during the Large-Scale Biosphere\xe2\x80\x93Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) were conducted over the Southwestern Amazon region in September\xe2\x80\x93October 2002, to emphasize the dry-to-wet transition season. The CCN concentrations were measured for values within the range 0.1\xe2\x80\x931.0% of supersaturation. The CCN concentration inside the boundary layer revealed a general decreasing trend during the transition from the end of the dry season to the onset of the wet season. Clean and polluted areas showed large differences. The differences were not so strong at high levels in the troposphere and there was evidence supporting the semi-direct aerosol effect in suppressing convection through the evaporation of clouds by aerosol absorption. The measurements also showed a diurnal cycle following biomass burning activity. Although biomass burning was the most important source of CCN, it was seen as a source of relatively efficient CCN, since the increase was significant only at high supersaturations.'

Abstract: 'Professional and popular publications have increasingly depicted native peoples of Amazonia as \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d conservationists or as people with an innate \xe2\x80\x9cconservation ethic.\xe2\x80\x9d A few classic examples are cited repeatedly to advance this argument with the result that these cases tend to be generalized to all indigenous peoples. This paper explores the premise that many of these systems of resource conservation come from areas of Amazonia where human survival depends on careful management of the subsistence base and not from a culturally imbedded \xe2\x80\x9cconservation ethic.\xe2\x80\x9d Where resource constraints do not pertain, as in the case of the Yuqu\xc3\xad of lowland Bolivia, such patterns are unknown. Finally, the negative consequences of portraying all native peoples as natural conservationists is having some negative consequences in terms of current struggles to obtain indigenous land rights.'

Abstract: 'I studied effects of deforestation on diet and condition of three characid species; Astyanax zonatus, Knodus gamma, and Prionobrama filigera in small streams in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The best condition of K. gamma was found at sites with low canopy cover, while the best condition of P. filigera was found at sites with high canopy cover. Deforestation changed population structure of A. zonatus by decreasing mean size of individuals, but this was not associated with lower fish condition. A. zonatus was omnivorous, and fed equally on invertebrate and plant food. A. zonatus increased feeding on aquatic food items (filamentous algae and fish scales) in the deforested sites (43%) compared to the forested sites (16%). K. gamma was an omnivorous species with preference for invertebrates. K. gamma was mainly feeding on terrestrial food sources in the forested sites, but switched to equal feeding between terrestrial and aquatic food sources in the deforested sites. P. filigera was an terrestrial insectivore feeder, and no differences in the overall food categories was found between stream groups. In contrast, there were no pronounced difference in the composition of invertebrate taxa in the stomachs of K. gamma between stream groups. However, less empty stomachs were observed among K. gamma in the deforested sites. The stomach contents of P. filigera showed great changes in composition of the predominating prey taxa between stream groups and less empty stomachs were observed among P. filigera in the forested sites. Food availability and utilisation seemed to be of main importance for the condition of these fish. Deforestation seems to favour species with high availability to utilise aquatic food items. In contrast, deforestation seems to have negative effects on species that are specialised on terrestrial invertebrates, and have low capacity to switch between aquatic and terrestrial food items.'

Abstract: 'Chemical and biological aspects of litter production and decomposition were studied in three distinct areas of the Central Amazon. Litter production was measured during three years, employing the litter trap technique, with adapted conical collectors. Leaf litter decomposition was studied in experiments, over five-month-periods with repetitions for the dry and wet seasons, using the nylon-mesh bag technique. The greatest litter production took place during the drier period of the year, mainly from June to October, while decomposition processes were more accentuated in the wet season: in the plateau site, one-half, of the litter disappears, according to a mathematical model, in about, 218 days under dry season conditions as against 32 days in the wet season. In the rainy season, weight reduction and mineral losses from decomposing leaves occurred more rapidly, owing to the intense biological activity on the material during this period. Particularly noticeable was the intense activity of termites in organic matter breakdown and mineral removal, and the extensive root penetration in the decomposing leaves, which removed some minerals but increased the amounts of other. Leaching effects were also quite noticeable in this period. During the rainy season, in the latosol sites, termites were responsible for more than 40% of the removal of decomposing leaves. While intense biological activity appears to be the major factor responsible for weight reduction and loss of many minerals, as well as for the accumulation of some other minerals (mainly zinc iron and aluminium) in the decomposing material, leaching seems to be the major factor responsible for the loss of certain minerals such as potassium, boron and copper.'

Abstract: "Problems with studies, claims, and assumptions that have been made about the causes of fires in Indonesia's tropical moist forests are identified, and the kinds of concepts, methods, prioritizing, and data needed to resolve the problems are discussed. Separate sections are devoted to studying ignitions, studying fire susceptibility and fire behavior, and using the goal of causal explanation to guide interdisciplinary research."

Abstract: 'Carbon monoxide measurements made from the space shuttle show maxima over South America, central Africa, the eastern Mediterranean, and China. The maxima appear to be associated with either concomitant or prior convection in the air masses which carries boundary layer air into the upper troposphere. Previous aircraft measurements of carbon monoxide and ozone over South America are shown to be consistent with this view. In the tropics the three regions of long-term mean rising motion, which form part of the Walker circulation, are associated with elevated carbon monoxide.'

Abstract: 'Large rivers of the tropics, many of which have extensive floodplains and deltas, are important in the delivery of nutrients and sediments to marine environments, in methane emission to the atmosphere and in providing ecosystem services associated with their high biological productivity. These ecosystem functions entail biogeochemical processes that will be influenced by climate change. Evidence for recent climate-driven changes in tropical rivers exists, but remains equivocal. Model projections suggest substantial future climate-driven changes, but they also underscore the complex interactions that control landscape water balances, river discharges and biogeochemical processes. The most important changes are likely to involve: (1) aquatic thermal regimes, with implications for thermal optima of plants and animals, rates of microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations, density stratification of water bodies and dissolved oxygen depletion; (2) hydrological regimes of discharge and floodplain inundation, which determine the ecological structure and function of rivers and floodplains and the extent and seasonality of aquatic environments; and (3) freshwater\xe2\x80\x93seawater gradients where rivers meet oceans, affecting the distribution of marine, brackish and freshwater environments and the biogeochemical processing as river water approaches the coastal zone. In all cases, climate change affects biogeochemical processes in concert with other drivers such as deforestation and other land use changes, dams and other hydrological alterations and water withdrawals. Furthermore, changes in riverine hydrology and biogeochemistry produce potential feedbacks to climate involving biogeochemical processes such as decomposition and methane emission. Future research should seek improved understanding of these changes, and long-term monitoring should be extended to shallow waters of wetlands and floodplains in addition to the larger lakes and rivers that are most studied.'

Abstract: 'Wetlands cover at least 6\xc2\xa0% of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. They play a key role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, harbour a large part of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity, and provide multiple services to humankind. However, pressure in the form of land reclamation, intense resource exploitation, changes in hydrology, and pollution threaten wetlands on all continents. Depending on the region, 30\xe2\x80\x9390\xc2\xa0% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wetlands have already been destroyed or strongly modified in many countries with no sign of abatement. Climate change scenarios predict additional stresses on wetlands, mainly because of changes in hydrology, temperature increases, and a rise in sea level. Yet, intact wetlands play a key role as buffers in the hydrological cycle and as sinks for organic carbon, counteracting the effects of the increase in atmospheric CO2. Eight chapters comprising this volume of Aquatic Sciences analyze the current ecological situation and the use of the wetlands in major regions of the world in the context of global climate change. This final chapter provides a synthesis of the findings and recommendations for the sustainable use and protection of these important ecosystems.'

Abstract: "Because of its large area of high C density forests and high deforestation rate, Brazil may play an important role in the global C cycle. The study reported here developed an estimate of Brazil's biotic CO2-C budget for the period 1990\xe2\x80\x932010. The analysis used a spreadsheet C accounting model based on three major components: a conceptual model of ecosystem C cycling, a recently completed vegetation classification developed from remote-sensing data, and published estimates of C density for each of the vegetation classes. The dynamics of the model came from estimates of disturbance to ecosystems that release C and estimates of recovery from past disturbance that store C. The model was projected into the future with three alternative estimates of the rate of future land use change. Under all three deforestation scenarios Brazil was a C source in the range of about 3\xe2\x80\x935 \xc3\x97 109 MgC over the 20-yr study period."

Abstract: 'Tapping into the vast pool of existing plant resource knowledge is the first step toward developing production systems that successfully balance ecological, economic, and cultural concerns in the newly formed extractive reserves in Acre, Brazil. Field research targeting extractive activities by women in the forest communities identified the most common species used by women, and documented specific information on the management, collection, and processing of these plants. The women demonstrate refined botanical knowledge and plant management skills, exploiting over 150 wild and domesticated species in their communities. They possess particular proficiency in processing plants, especially species used for food, spices, beverages, and medicines. Women also display a great desire to enter the market economy, and have begun to test potential market products on a small scale. As such they can play a key role in production, diversification, and development of economically valuable plant products, and ultimately in the success of the extractive reserves.'

Abstract: 'The neotropical tribe Clusieae contains six genera including Dystovomita and Tovomita. Material from the Ducke Reserve (Manaus), determined as Dystovomita brasiliensis, had been used in a recent phylogenetic study and was shown to be nested in Tovomita, leaving some doubt as to its determination. Having examined various types of Dystovomita brasiliensis we confirm the identity of the specimens from the Ducke Reserve and here accommodate the species within Tovomita as Tovomita hopkinsii. Illustrations, distribution map, an expanded description, and a discussion about the most closely related species of Tovomita are provided.'

Abstract: 'Little is known of how soil archaeal community composition and diversity differ between local variants of tropical rainforests. We hypothesized that (1) as with plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria, the soil archaeal community would differ between different variants of tropical forest; (2) that spatially rarer forest variants would have a less diverse archaeal community than common ones; (3) that a history of forest disturbance would decrease archaeal alpha- and beta-diversity; and (4) that archaeal distributions within the forest would be governed more by deterministic than stochastic factors. We sampled soil across several different forest types within Brunei, Northwest Borneo. Soil DNA was extracted, and the 16S rRNA gene of archaea was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. We found that (1) as hypothesized, there are distinct archaeal communities for each forest type, and community composition significantly correlates with soil parameters including pH, organic matter, and available phosphorous. (2) As hypothesized, the \xe2\x80\x9crare\xe2\x80\x9d white sand forest variants kerangas and inland heath had lower archaeal diversity. A nestedness analysis showed that archaeal community in inland heath and kerangas was mainly a less diverse subset of that in dipterocarp forests. However, primary dipterocarp forest had the lowest beta-diversity among the other tropical forest types. (3) Also, as predicted, forest disturbance resulted in lower archaeal alpha-diversity\xe2\x80\x94but increased beta-diversity in contrast with our predictions. (4) Contrary to our predictions, the BetaNTI of the various primary forest types indicated community assembly was mainly stochastic. The possible effects of these habitat and disturbance-related effects on N cycling should be investigated.'

Abstract: 'High litter inputs in agroforestry systems contribute to soil microbial activity, soil fertility and productivity. Considering that the cycling of organic matter is essential to the maintenance of physical\xe2\x80\x93chemical and microbiological properties of the soil, the aims of this work were to estimate the production, accumulation and decomposition of litter, and assess soil microbial respiration in a complex multistrata agroforestry system located in the north-east of Brazil. This agroforestry system has three strata formed by forest and fruit trees and species of multiple uses. During 3\xc2\xa0years (2011\xe2\x80\x932013), leaf litter was sampled monthly to account for litterfall and quarterly to account for litter accumulation. The rates of litter decomposition were estimated using the ratio produced-to-accumulated litter, and the correlation between litter fall and rainfall was calculated. Precipitation data were provided by the water and climate agency of Pernambuco (APAC). Soil samples (0\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0cm) were also taken quarterly, simultaneously with the litter accumulation samples, and soil microbial respiration was assessed using the capture, by a KOH solution, of the evolved CO2. The annual production of leaf litter was stable in the 3\xc2\xa0years of study in this agroforestry system, and the monthly input of litter to the soil was influenced by rainfall, being higher in the dry seasons. The accumulated litter on the ground was constant, as was microbial activity (respiration) through time. The estimated litter decomposition rates were 1.49 (first year), 1.33 (second year) and 1.42 (third year), being considered rapid rates of decomposition. This guarantees (to the farmer) that this system is capable of maintaining soil fertility and eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers.'

Abstract: 'The data needed to prioritize areas for biodiversity protection are records of biodiversity features \xe2\x80\x94 species, species assemblages, environmental classes \xe2\x80\x94 for each candidate area. Prioritizing areas means comparing candidate areas, so the data used to make such comparisons should be comparable in quality and quantity. Potential sources of suitable data include museums, herbariums and natural resource management agencies. Issues of data precision, accuracy and sampling bias in data sets from such sources are discussed and methods for treating data to minimize bias are reviewed.'

Abstract: 'Although primate predation is rarely observed, a series of primate anti-predation strategies have been described. Energetic costs of such strategies can vary from high-cost mobbing, via less costly alarm calling, to low-cost furtive concealment. Here we report the anti-predation strategies of red-nosed cuxi\xc3\xba, Chiropotes albinasus, based on direct observations from four study sites in southeastern Brazilian Amazonia. Over a collective period of 1255 fieldwork hours, we observed nine direct interactions between raptors (all potential predators) and red-nosed cuxi\xc3\xbas. Of these, one (11%) resulted in predation. Raptors involved were: Harpia harpyja (four events), Leucopternis sp. (two events), Spiza\xc3\xabtus tyrannus (one event), and unidentified large raptors (two events). Predation attempts occurred in flooded-forest and terra firme rainforest, were directed at both adult and non-adult cuxi\xc3\xbas, and involved both adult and juvenile raptors. Anti-predation strategies adopted by the cuxi\xc3\xbas included: (1) group defence and mobbing behaviour (two occasions), (2) dropping into dense sub-canopy (seven occasions), (3) alarm calling (eight occasions), and (4) fleeing to, and hiding in, dense vegetation (eight occasions). During each encounter at least two of these behaviours were recorded. These are the first published records of predation, predation attempts, and anti-predator behaviour involving red-nosed cuxi\xc3\xba.'

Abstract: ' Hunting by Iban forest farmers in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, is an important part of their subsistence economy, and as such became a focus of study as part of a conservation project in the Danau Sentarum Wildlife Reserve. In this paper, we examine Iban hunting of nonhuman primates with comparison to other large mammals. We analyze rates of encounter and capture, comparing encounters, hunting trips, and animal numbers. Information on habitats hunted shows the importance of secondary and old growth forest. Also examined are Iban attitudes, game preferences, and taboos. The significance of these findings is discussed with regard to the threats to wildlife from increases in the use of shotguns, human population, and habitat destruction, showing that conservation may be aided by promoting or enhancing certain aspects of the traditional Iban agroforestry system.

Abstract: 'Recent studies on the effects of tropical forest fragmentation indicate that fragmented landscapes are complex and heterogeneous systems influenced by factors other than the size or degree of isolation of forest remnants: of particular importance are the quality of the matrix and the edge-induced habitat changes. In order to investigate the influence of these factors, small mammals were surveyed in 36 sites in the landscape of Una, a region that encompasses some of the last and largest Atlantic Forest remnants in northeastern Brazil. Six sites were distributed on each of six landscape components \xe2\x80\x93 the interiors and edges of small remnants, the interiors and edges of large remnants, and the most common forested habitats found in the matrix. The survey comprised 46,656 trap-nights and yielded 1725 individuals of 20 species of rodents and marsupials. Results revealed: an increase in beta-diversity caused by fragmentation; the contrasting effects of the altered forested habitats of the matrix, which harbor both forest and disturbance-adapted species; a greater importance of edge effect than of patch size to the observed changes in small mammal community in remnants; an association among terrestrial forest species and among arboreal forest species in terms of the distribution and abundance in the Una mosaic; and a distinctive vulnerability of these two groups of species to fragmentation. Results emphasize the biological importance and conservation value of both fragmented landscapes and small remnants in the Atlantic Forest, as well as the importance of management techniques to control and attenuate edge effects.'

Rev.58(3): 225\xe2\x80\x93348. 1992.\xe2\x80\x94This treatment of the flowering plants is the latest revision of my classification of the Class Angiospermae and replaces my 1983 and more recent 1992 synopses. An update is necessary because so much new information has been published in the last decade pertinent to the classification of the flowering plants. About 870 such recent books, monographs, and other botanical papers are cited in the Introduction, listed primarily by the botanical discipline that they represent. Also considerable changes in my classification have been necessitated by my narrowed family- and ordinal-gap concepts, acceptance of the ending \xe2\x80\x9c-anae\xe2\x80\x9d for superorders in place of the traditional but inappropriate \xe2\x80\x9c-iflorae,\xe2\x80\x9d and acceptance of more prior or more widely used names for the categories above the family. A new phyletic \xe2\x80\x9cshrub\xe2\x80\x9d replaces earlier versions, and attempts to indicate visually relative sizes and relationships among the superorders, orders, and suborders. One table includes a statistical summary of floweringplant taxa: ca. 233,900 species of 12,650 genera, 437 families, and 708 subfamilies and undivided families in 28 superorders, 71 orders, and 71 suborders of Angiospermae. Three other tables summarize the known indigenous distribution of the families and subfamilies of angiosperms about the world. The synopsis lists the flowering plant taxa from the class down to the subfamily (and in Asteraceae down to the tribe) with indication of the degree of confidence I place in the circumscription and placement of each category above the subfamily, the best available estimates of the number of genera and species for each category, and the known indigenous distribution of each subfamily and family. Table V lists alphabetically the geographical abbreviations used in the synopsis. The extensive bibliography of recent literature should be helpful to those persons interested in the classification of the flowering plants.'

Abstract: 'Seasonally Dry Tropical Plant Formations (SDTFs) are among the most threatened biomes worldwide. Nevertheless, they have received less scientific attention than rainforests or savannas. One such SDTF, the Caatinga Phytogeographic Domain (CPD), is the largest semiarid tropical ecoregion in South America. Earlier floristic studies of the Caatinga flora discerned two floristic groups in the CPD, in terrains of crystalline and sedimentary origin respectively. We compiled and analysed the most comprehensive dataset on CPD plant distributions to produce a general biogeographical synthesis for Caatinga, including inselbergs, riverine forests and ecotonal areas. Not only are crystalline and sedimentary caatingas clearly distinct, but inselbergs collectively form a third floristic group in the CPD. Non-woody plants, omitted from many studies, are a major component of Caatinga diversity, comprising more than 60\xc2\xa0% of species in some local communities. Raunkiaerian life-form spectra of Caatinga sites show that Caatinga vegetation differs in life-form spectra from those of major world biomes, supporting recognition of SDTFs as a discrete world biome.'

Abstract: 'Few studies have included detailed investigations of the interactions of agroforestry techniques with pests and diseases, although the relevance of such interactions has long been recognized. The objectives of this review are to provide basic information on pests and diseases in tropical agroforestry systems and to develop concepts which can assist in the future in the systematic data collection and analysis in this field. The emphasis is on simultaneous agroforestry systems with annual and perennial crops, although rotational systems are also discussed. Crop rotation is an important pest and disease control strategy in annual cropping systems, and the principle of altering host with non-host plants can also be applied in improved fallow systems, provided that hosts of crop pests and diseases are avoided when selecting the fallow species. When annual cropping systems are transformed into simultaneous agroforestry, the control strategy of frequent disturbance of pest and disease populations is to some extent substituted for the strategy of increased stability and internal control mechanisms. However, reduced pest and disease risk is not automatically achieved by introducing perennial plants and increasing the plant diversity in a system. If plant species are introduced that harbor pests or diseases of other species in the system, the risk of pest and disease outbreaks may actually increase. For evaluating such risks, it is important to consider host-ranges of diseases on the pathovar instead of the species level. Beside the selection of compatible plant species, their spatial arrangement may be important for reducing the spread of pest and disease organisms through the system, although little information is available on such effects, and they may be largely irrelevant for organisms with efficient dispersal mechanisms such as wind-dispersed fungi. In addition to the species-specific, \xe2\x80\x98biological\xe2\x80\x99 effects of plants on pests and diseases, their unspecific, \xe2\x80\x98physical\xe2\x80\x99 effects can be of major relevance for pest and disease development as well as the susceptibility of the affected plant species. Increased pest and disease incidence has often been observed directly at the tree-crop interface, caused by the humid microclimate, physical protection of mammal and bird pests by the trees and eventually reduced pest and disease tolerance of competition-stressed crops. Linear tree plantings and hedgerows affect the wind transport of small insects and disease propagules, the active immigration and emigration of pest organisms as well as the populations of natural enemies. Similarly, overhead shade has a major effect on the micro-climatic conditions under which pest and disease organisms, their natural enemies and the crops themselves develop, and its optimization is a highly efficient control strategy for many pests and diseases. On infertile soils, the susceptibility of crops to pests and diseases is strongly affected by the availability of plant nutrients, which may be influenced by agroforestry techniques in various ways. Soil management measures such as mulching and planting cover crops may affect crop health by improving soil fertility and by directly acting on pest and disease populations. The importance of a more systematic collection of pest and disease related information for agroforestry, e.g., in a central database, and of the development of strategies for reducing pest and disease risks in agroforestry in cooperation with farmers is stressed.'

Abstract: 'Parasites can exert selection pressure on their hosts through effects on survival, on reproductive success, on sexually selected ornament, with important ecological and evolutionary consequences, such as changes in population viability. Consequently, hemoparasites have become the focus of recent avian studies. Infection varies significantly among taxa. Various factors might explain the differences in infection among taxa, including habitat, climate, host density, the presence of vectors, life history and immune defence. Feeding behaviour can also be relevant both through increased exposure to vectors and consumption of secondary metabolites with preventative or therapeutic effects that can reduce parasite load. However, the latter has been little investigated. Psittaciformes (parrots and cockatoos) are a good model to investigate these topics, as they are known to use biological control against ectoparasites and to feed on toxic food. We investigated the presence of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium), intracellular haemosporidians (Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon), unicellular flagellate protozoans (Trypanosoma) and microfilariae in 19 Psittaciformes species from a range of habitats in the Indo-Malayan, Australasian and Neotropical regions. We gathered additional data on hemoparasites in wild Psittaciformes from the literature. We considered factors that may control the presence of hemoparasites in the Psittaciformes, compiling information on diet, habitat, and climate. Furthermore, we investigated the role of diet in providing antiparasitic secondary metabolites that could be used as self-medication to reduce parasite load.'

Abstract: 'From June through December, data were collected on the diet and ranging patterns of moustached (Saguinus mystax) and saddle-back (Saguinus fuscicollis) tamarin monkeys in the Amazon Basin of northeastern Peru. During this 7-month period, insects and nonleguminous fruits accounted for 83% of tamarin feeding and foraging time. Despite marked seasonal variation in rainfall and forest productivity, patterns of habitat utilization, day range, dietary diversity, resource exploitation, and activity budget remained relatively stable throughout the year. Moustached and saddle-back tamarins appear to solve problems of food acquisition and exploit patchily distributed feeding sites using a relatively limited set of foraging patterns. In general, these primates concentrate their daily feeding efforts on several trees from a small number of target plant species. These feeding sites are uncommon, produce only a small amount of ripe fruit each day, and are characterized by a high degree of intraspecific fruiting and flowering synchrony. Trees of the same species are frequently visited in succession, and individual feeding sites are revisited several times over the course of 1\xe2\x80\x932 weeks. This type of foraging pattern occurred during both dry and wet seasons and when exploiting fruit, nectar, legume, and exudate resources. Seasonal variation in the percentage of feeding and foraging time devoted to insectivory was also limited. In this investigation, there was no consistent evidence that temporal changes in overall forest fruit production had a major impact on the feeding, foraging, or ranging behavior of either tamarin species.'

Abstract: 'Seventeen polymorphic microsatellite markers were isolated from enriched genomic libraries for Theobroma cacao, providing additional tools for studying the genetic diversity and map saturation of this species. These markers were characterized in 32 accessions of the T. cacao germplasm collection from the Centro de Pesquisas do Cacau. The number of alleles at each locus varied from 2 to 8, with an average of 4.41 alleles per locus. The polymorphism information content varied from 0.060 to 0.695, with an average of 0.333. The markers characterized in this study will be employed in map saturation studies and diversity assessments of cacao genotypes.'

Abstract: ' Neosartorya indohii and N. tsurutae, two new Neosartorya species isolated from tropical rainforest soil in the Amazonian area, Brazil, are described and illustrated. Neosartorya indohii is characterized by its spreading growth on Czapek\xe2\x80\x99s and malt extract agars, light yellow cleistothecia, broadly lenticular ascospores with two conspicuously serrate-incised equatorial crests and tuberculate convex surfaces, and globose to subglobose conidia with a smooth wall. Neosartorya tsurutae is characterized by its spreading growth on Czapek\xe2\x80\x99s and malt extract agars, white cleistothecia, broadly lenticular ascospores with four equatorial crests and rugulose-ruminate convex surfaces, and ovoid to broadly ellipsoidal conidia with a smooth wall.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82Neotropical tree crops are affected by a combination of biological and human factors that complicate the study of genetic diversity and crop evolution. Genetic diversity and relationships among southern Mexican populations and horticultural collections of Theobroma cacao (chocolate, cocoa, cacao) are examined in light of the agricultural practices of the Maya. Collections of cacao were obtained from the extremes of its geographic range including archeological sites in southern Mexico where cacao was first domesticated. Genetic diversity was assayed by 57 informative random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker loci. A unique sample of the total diversity found in this study exists in the southern Mexican populations. These populations are significantly different from all other cacao with regards to their profile of RAPD bands, including the \xe2\x80\x98criollo\xe2\x80\x99 variety, their morphological and geographical group. A population of cacao found in a sinkhole (cenote) in northern Yucatan with genetic affinities to populations in Chiapas suggests the Maya maintained plants far away from their native habitat. This finding concurs with known agroforestry practices of the Maya. Modern efforts to increase germplasm of tropical tree crops such as cacao should carefully examine archeological sites where genetic diversity, either deliberately or by chance, was collected and maintained by ancient cultures.'

Abstract: 'The present paper elucidates the pattern of leaf and non-leaf fall and quantifies of the total annual input of litter in a dry tropical forest of India. In addition, concentration of selected nutrients in various litter species and their annual return to the forest floor are examined. Total annual input of litter measured in litter traps ranged between 488.0\xe2\x80\x93671.0 g m-2 of which 65\xe2\x80\x9372% was leaf litter fall and 28\xe2\x80\x9335% wood litter fall. 73\xe2\x80\x9381% leaves fall during the winter season. Herbaceous litter fall ranged between 80.0\xe2\x80\x93110.0 g m-2 yr-1. The annual nutrient return through litter fall amounted (kg ha-1): 51.6\xe2\x80\x9369.6 N, 3.1\xe2\x80\x934.3 P, 31.0\xe2\x80\x9340.0 Ca, 14.0\xe2\x80\x9319.0 K and 3.7\xe2\x80\x935.0 Na, of which 71\xe2\x80\x9377% and 23\xe2\x80\x9329% were contributed by leaf and wood litter fall, respectively for different nutrients. Input of nutrients through herbaceous litter was: 13.0\xe2\x80\x9316.6 for N, 1.0\xe2\x80\x931.4 for P, 4.0\xe2\x80\x935.0 for Ca, 7.9\xe2\x80\x9310.5 for K and 0.8\xe2\x80\x931.0 kg ha-1 yr-1 for Na.'

Abstract: 'Small watersheds are characterized by a high degree of sensitivity to changes observed in their environment, making them important sampling and management units. Due to this high sensitivity, several studies have shown that intensive collecting may be more effective in these systems compared to other timescale procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentration of organic and inorganic nutrients and major ions dissolved in two small watersheds with different land uses to determine whether there are differences between these watersheds with different levels of impact and to identify the most appropriate timescale procedure for the variables under analysis. Therefore, monthly, daily, and hourly samples were taken in the two streams in the northeast of Brazil. One of the streams is located in an undisturbed area (environmental protected area) (S1) and one in a disturbed area (S2). The results showed significant differences for conductivity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (%), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl\xe2\x88\x92) ions and higher values presented in the anthropogenic stream. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in S2 mainly comprised ammonium (NH4 +), while nitrate (NO3 \xe2\x88\x92) predominated in S1. The considerable increase in the concentration of NO3 \xe2\x88\x92 and dilution of Na+ and Cl\xe2\x88\x92 after rain in April in S1 shows how precipitation may change the chemical composition of the water in a 1-day period. No changes were observed in the concentrations of major ions and nutrients that could be related to the cyclical variation of the hours during the day in both small watersheds. Daily collections allow better monitoring of the dynamics of streams and greater robustness of the data.'

Abstract: 'Seasonal drought is a common occurrence in humid climates. The year 2003 was the driest year during the period 1985\xe2\x80\x932011 in southeastern China. The objective of this study was to elucidate the impact of the exceptional drought in 2003, compared with eddy flux measurements during 2004\xe2\x80\x9311, on the dynamics of evapotranspiration (ET) and related factors, as well as their underlying mechanisms, in a subtropical coniferous plantation in southeastern China. It was found that daily ET decreased from 5.34 to 1.84 mm during the intensive drought period and recovered to 4.80 mm during the subsquent recovering drought period. Path analysis indicated that ET was mainly determined by canopy conductance and deep soil water content (50 cm) during the intensive drought and recovering drought periods, respectively. The canopy conductance offset the positive effect of air vapor pressure deficit on ET when suffering drought stress, while the canopy conductance enhanced the positive effect of air temperature on ET during the late growing season. Because the fine roots of this plantation are mainly distributed in shallow soil, and the soil water in the upper 40 cm did not satisfy the demand for ET, stomatal closure and defoliation were evident as physiological responses to drought stress.'

Abstract: 'Until recently, the first Americans were thought to be fluted-point spear-hunters from the Siberian steppes. Near the end of the Ice Age, they followed big-game herds over the Bering land bridge into the open, upland habitats of the interior of North America about 12,000 years ago. Rapidly extinguishing the big game herds with their deadly hunting methods, they pressed southward in search of new herds and reached the tip of South America about a thousand years later. Today, nearly 70 years after the first excavations at Clovis, New Mexico, the type site for this culture, new sites and new dates from both North and South America are forcing a revision of the earlier picture of the migrations and adaptations of the first Americans. But despite recurring claims that human colonization of the Western Hemisphere began as early as 20,000 or more years ago with the arrival of generalized foragers lacking a projectile-point tradition, no definitive data gives empirical support for a human presence before c. 12,000 before the present (B.P.). All supposed pre-Clovis cultures except one in Alaska have failed to withstand careful scrutiny of their data. In addition, despite recent claims for cultural and biological links of the migrants to Europe or the Pacific Islands, the skeletons and cultural assemblages of Paleoindians throughout the hemisphere point consistently to a northeast Asian origin. According to new data, Paleoindian ancestors in Beringia c. 12,000 years ago were not specialized, fluted-point hunters of large game, but broad-spectrum hunter-gatherers using triangular or bipointed, lanceolates. Diverse cultures descended from these ancestors, not only the big-game hunting Clovis culture of the North American high plains. And just as Clovis did not set the cultural pattern for the hemisphere, it was not the earliest culture. Fully contemporary with the earliest possible Clovis dates of c. 11,200, in South America there already were maritime foragers on the Pacific coast, small-game hunters in the southern pampas, and tropical forest riverine foragers in the eastern tropical lowlands. The Clovis culture thus was just one of several regional cultures developed in the millennium after the initial migration. It could not have been the ancestor of the other early Paleoindian cultures.'

Abstract: 'The development and current status of mapping the vegetation of Brazil is discussed. This includes the manner of portraying the vegetation on maps, especially with regard to physiognomy and structure, the floristic composition and ecological relations. A slow beginning has given way to a rapid though uneven development. Recent government efforts tend to correct this.'

Abstract: 'The relationships between soils attributes, soil carbon stocks and vegetation carbon stocks are poorly know in Amazonia, even at regional scale. In this paper, we used the large and reliable soil database from Western Amazonia obtained from the RADAMBRASIL project and recent estimates of vegetation biomass to investigate some environmental relationships, quantifying C stocks of intact ecosystem in Western Amazonia. The results allowed separating the western Amazonia into 6 sectors, called pedo-zones: Roraima, Rio Negro Basin, Tertiary Plateaux of the Amazon, Javari-Juru\xc3\xa1-Purus lowland, Acre Basin and Rondonia uplands. The highest C stock for the whole soil is observed in the Acre and in the Rio Negro sectors. In the former, this is due to the high nutrient status and high clay activity, whereas in the latter, it is attributed to a downward carbon movement attributed to widespread podzolization and arenization, forming spodic horizons. The youthful nature of shallow soils of the Javari-Juru\xc3\xa1-Purus lowlands, associated with high Al, results in a high phytomass C/soil C ratio. A similar trend was observed for the shallow soils from the Roraima and Rondonia highlands. A consistent east\xe2\x80\x93west decline in biomass carbon in the Rio Negro Basin sector is associated with increasing rainfall and higher sand amounts. It is related to lesser C protection and greater C loss of sandy soils, subjected to active chemical leaching and widespread podzolization. Also, these soils possess lower cation exchangeable capacity and lower water retention capacity. Zones where deeply weathered Latosols dominate have a overall pattern of high C sequestration, and greater than the shallower soils from the upper Amazon, west of Madeira and Negro rivers. This was attributed to deeper incorporation of carbon in these clayey and highly pedo-bioturbated soils. The results highlight the urgent need for refining soil data at an appropriate scale for C stocks calculations purposes in Amazonia. There is a risk of misinterpreting C stocks in Amazonia when such great pedological variability is not taken into account.'

Abstract: 'The species richness and conservation status of primates in the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, northeastern Peru, located between the Yavari and Amazon rivers is reported. Two sites within a continuous forest were studied in the 322 500 ha reserve. Primate densities were estimated from censuses of 290 km of line transects using Fourier series expansion. Fourteen species of anthropoid primates have been confirmed to occur sympatrically in the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo which is the greatest species richness of primates reported to date within a Peruvian conservation unit. Hunting by local inhabitants has decreased the densities and biomasses of Cebids in the reserve, but not Callitrichids. A management plan for hunting in the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo has been developed to better conserve primates and other mammalian species.'

Abstract: 'Big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) is one of the most valuable and overharvested timber trees of tropical America. In order to better characterize geographic patterns of genetic variation, we performed a phylogeographic analysis of S. macrophylla based on six polymorphic chloroplast genome simple sequence repeat loci (cpSSRs) analyzed in 16 populations (N\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89245 individuals) distributed across Central America and the Brazilian Amazon. Of the 31 total cpDNA haplotypes identified, 16 occurred in Central America and 15 in Amazonia with no single haplotype shared between the two regions. Populations from Central America showed moderate differentiation (F  ST \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.36) while within population genetic diversity was generally high (mean Nei\xe2\x80\x99s H  E \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.639). In contrast, the Amazonian populations were strongly differentiated (F  ST \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.91) and contained relatively low genetic diversity (mean H  E \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.176), except for one highly diverse population (H  E \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.925) from eastern Amazonia. Spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) identified a single Central American phylogroup and four Amazonian phylogroups, indicating stronger phylogeographic structure within Amazonia. The results demonstrate distinctive regional patterns of S. macrophylla differentiation, and the first evidence of a strong phylogeographic break between Central American and South American mahogany populations. We suggest that the frequent occurrence of hurricanes in Central America, the differences in the glacial histories and in the duration and intensity of anthropogenic disturbance during the late Holocene may have played important roles in the geographic structuring of cpDNA lineages in the two regions. The high private haplotype diversity in Brazilian populations suggests that cpSSRs can be used as DNA barcodes for regional timber certification.'

Abstract: 'Relationships between fine root growth, rates of litter decomposition and nutrient release were analysed in a mixed forest on Tierra Firme, a Tall Amazon Caatinga and a Low Bana on podsolized sands near San Carlos de Rio Negro. Fine root growth in the upper soil layers (root mat+10 cm upper soil) was considerably higher in the Tierra Firme forest (1117 g m-2 yr-1) than in tall Cattinga (120) and Bana (235). Fine root growth on top of the root mat was stimulated significantly by added N in Tall Caatinga and Low Bana forests, by P in Tierra Firme and Bana forests, and by Ca only in the Tierra Firme forest. Rate of fine root growth in Tierra Firme forest on fresh litter is strongly correlated with the Mg and Ca content of litter. Rate of litter decomposition was inversely related to % lignin and the lignin/N ratio of litter. Litter contact with the dense root mat of the Tierra Firme increased rates of disappearance for biomass, Ca and Mg as compared with litter permanently separated or lifted weekly from the root mat to avoid root attachment. Nitrogen concentration of decomposing litter increased in all forests, net N released being observed only in Caryocar glabrum and Aspidosperma megalocarpum of the Tierra Firme forest after one year of exposure. Results emphasize the differences in limiting nutrients in amazonian forest ecosystems on contrasting soil types: Tierra Firme forests are particularly limited by Ca and Mg, while Caatinga and Bana forests are limited mainly by N availability.'

Abstract: 'Survey costs and a lack of taxonomists are often the main impediments to biodiversity inventories. The use of a higher-taxon approach that is efficient in representing species patterns within a short period of time is one way to overcome these constraints, especially if these responses are consistent at various spatial scales and sampling techniques. Here, we evaluated whether the use of pitfall trapping or Winkler extraction influenced the utility of genus as a surrogate to predict patterns of species richness and composition related to environment. The study sites were spread along 10 degrees of latitude, covering phytophysiognomies with different topographic characteristics. We recorded 450 ant species/morphospecies distributed in 70 genera. Pitfall-traps captured a larger proportion of species (77\xe2\x80\x9398%) and genera (71\xe2\x80\x93100%) per site. Genus was efficient in predicting variations in richness, and assemblage composition detected at the species level, using pitfall-traps or Winkler extractors. The higher-taxon approach saved approximately 40% of the surveys costs. The negative effect of the species-genus ratio was detected only on species composition, but it did not affect the quality of predictions using genera. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that genus can be used as a proxy for broader sets of species independent of sampling technique or environmental heterogeneity. The use of pitfall-traps or Winkler extractors for genus-level identification proved to be cost-efficient and time-efficient and should work well in other regions requiring conservation effort and monitoring programs.'

Abstract: 'Ipecac (Psychotria ipecacuanha) is a perennial, medicinal herb that grows in the understory of semi-deciduous tropical forests in the Neotropics. Ipecacs present a widely disjunct distribution, with two of its three ranges occurring in Brazil. The Amazonian populations are at least 1600\xc2\xa0km from the nearest Atlantic populations. This work used ISSR markers to compare the genetic diversity and structure of populations from the two Brazilian ranges. Lower genetic diversity in Amazon populations (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa060.11%, Hs\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.18) and higher genetic diversity in Atlantic populations (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa073.94%, Hs\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.20) were detected. Differentiation between ranges were high (\xce\xb8 B\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.6838, GST-B\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.6665). AMOVA revealed that 65.3% of the total molecular variance can be attributed to regional differences between the two ranges. Principal coordinate analyses and cluster analyses organized ipecacs at either individual or population level into two exclusive groups that correspond each to one of the two disjunct ranges, without exception. The results do not support a scenario that postulates human-mediated, long-distance dispersal events as a plausible origin for the distribution of the Brazilian ipecacs, but indicate geographic isolation as a long-standing barrier to genetic exchange and connectivity among populations from different ranges. Conservation implications are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Agroecology is the application of ecological concepts and principles to the design and management of sustainable agricultural systems. An agroecological approach to agriculture has special importance in the humid tropics where agricultural development and the preservation of tropical forests are most often in direct conflict. It is proposed that a more sustainable approach to development is needed, where agroecosystems depend on low external inputs, function more on the use of locally available and renewable resources, have benign impacts on the environment, and are based on the knowledge and culture of the local inhabitants. Examples of traditional agroecosystem management in Mesoamerica that can provide this basis are presented. The preservation of both biological and cultural diversity are integral to the long-term sustainable management of natural resources in the tropics.'

Abstract: 'In the Napu and Palolo Valleys of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, a chronosequence sought to identify the relationship between tree age, nutrient dynamics and cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) yield in association with gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Steud.). The chronosequence surveyed cocoa-gliricidia plantations with a maximum age of 8 and 15\xc2\xa0years, respectively, in Napu and Palolo. The characteristics of the valleys were also quite different, with an altitude of 1,139\xe2\x80\x931,166\xc2\xa0m a.s.l. in Napu and 592\xe2\x80\x93651\xc2\xa0m a.s.l. in Palolo. Annual rainfall was 1,543\xc2\xa0mm in Napu and 1,811\xc2\xa0mm in Palolo. The yield of cocoa increased fairly steadily, with growth rates higher in Palolo than in Napu. Whereas a higher level of bean P led to a higher single bean weight (g d.w.) in Napu, a higher level of bean K led to a lower single bean weight in Palolo. The relatively high level of K appeared to have coincided with immature growth stages of cocoa. As trees matured, their increased rate of C assimilation was seen in the form of higher single bean weight. We found no statistically significant change in the soil\xe2\x80\x99s carbon-nutrient levels when viewed over the entire timeframe of 8 and 15\xc2\xa0years in the 2 valleys. In addition, there was no correlation between the soil\xe2\x80\x99s carbon-nutrient levels and the single bean weight. Nor did we find any correlation between the soil\xe2\x80\x99s carbon-nutrient levels impacting the bean\xe2\x80\x99s carbon-nutrient levels. Of regression lines, P had the steepest slope and was considered the most limited nutrient relative to the other nutrients although its correlation was insignificant. The farmers\xe2\x80\x99 estimation of cocoa yield was about 68% less than our measured bean weight per area per year (kg d.w. ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921), implying a more refined definition of ripeness. In a cocoa agroforest, income could be supplemented by durable tree crops instead of growing gliricidia which is removed after several years of growth. This removal and the shallow rooting of cocoa indicate that the cocoa production would be sustainable only in the immediate future.'

Abstract: 'The biotic and geologic dynamics of the Great American Biotic Interchange are reviewed and revised. Information on the Marine Isotope Stage chronology, sea level changes as well as Pliocene and Pleistocene vegetation changes in Central and northern South America add to a discussion of the role of climate in facilitating trans-isthmian exchanges. Trans-isthmian land mammal exchanges during the Pleistocene glacial intervals appear to have been promoted by the development of diverse non-tropical ecologies.'

Abstract: 'Local Knowledge Systems (LKS) consist of the knowledge, beliefs, traditions, practices, institutions, and worldviews developed and sustained by indigenous and local communities, and are believed to represent an adaptive strategy to the environment in which these communities live. The value of LKS has been contested by some scholars as being restricted to local issues [1], and local knowledge holders have alternative been labeled as "guardians of the earth", "conservationists", or as subsistence consumers who will no longer coexist sustainably with the environment when their populations increase, and as they become more integrated into market economies [2, 3, 4]. LKS have sometimes been viewed as "traditional", with the negative connotation of being outdated or primitive, and thus of little use to solve problems of modern society [5]. Others have put forward that the adaptive nature, applicability and value of LKS need to be empirically tested and validated by science [6, 7].'

Abstract: 'Considering the high rates of evapotranspiration of Amazonian forests, understanding the impacts of deforestation on water loss rates is important for assessing those impacts on a regional and global scale. This paper quantifies evapotranspiration rates in two different pasture sites in Amazonia and evaluates the differences between the sites. In both places, measured evapotranspiration varies seasonally, decreasing during the dry season. The decrease is higher at the southwestern Amazonia site, while at the central Amazonia site, the decrease is less pronounced. During the dry season, average values of evapotranspiration are around 2.2\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.6\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921 in central Amazonia and 2.4\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.6\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921 in southwestern Amazonia, while during the wet season, those values are 2.1\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.6\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921 in central Amazonia and 3.5\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.8\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921 in southwestern Amazonia. On an annual basis, the pasture in southwestern Amazonia has higher evapotranspiration than in central Amazonia. We conclude that the main reason for this difference is the lower available energy in the wet season at the central Amazonian site, combined with a lower leaf area index at this site during the whole year. Still, the evapotranspiration is significantly controlled by the vegetation, which is well coupled with the local moisture conditions in the dry season.'

Abstract: 'This study examines the role multilevel governance plays in the adoption of sustainable landscape management initiatives in emerging arrangements aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). It sheds light on the challenges these multiple layers of actors and interests encounter around such alternatives in a subnational jurisdiction. Through transcript analysis of 93 interviews with institutional actors in the region of Madre de Dios, Peru, particularly with regard to five sites of land-use change, we identified the multiple actors who are included and excluded in the decision-making process and uncovered their complex interactions in forest and landscape governance and REDD+ arrangements. Madre de Dios is a useful case for studying complex land-use dynamics, as it is home to multiple natural resources, a large mix of actors and interests, and a regional government that has recently experienced the reverberations of decentralization. Findings indicate that multiple actors shaped REDD+ to some extent, but REDD+ and its advocates were unable to shape land-use dynamics or landscape governance, at least in the short term. In the absence of strong and effective regional regulation for sustainable land use alternatives and the high value of gold on the international market, illegal gold mining proved to be a more profitable land-use choice. Although REDD+ created a new space for multilevel actor interaction and communication and new alliances to emerge, the study questions the prevailing REDD+ discourse suggesting that better coordination and cooperation will lead to integrated landscape solutions. For REDD+ to be able to play a role in integrated landscape governance, greater attention needs to be paid to grassroots actors, power and authority over territory and underlying interests and incentives for land-use change.'

Abstract: 'Agricultural research is increasingly a global effort. No country can remain isolated in agricultural research without damaging its capacity to respond to challenges to agricultural productivity. In this paper, we explore the role of botany in the international effort to raise and stabilize farm yields. Given the importance of wild species in crop breeding and the increasing use of wild species to upgrade crops, the value of systematics is underlined. The contribution of plant physiology is also discussed, particularly with reference to mechanisms of resistance to pests and diseases and tolerance to adverse soils and climates. The crucial role of ecological studies based on field work is also underscored, particularly as it applies to wild plants and natural genepools, as well as crop protection. The necessity for continued support of botanical studies and gardens is emphasized in the light of the global effort to conserve and utilize crop genetic diversity. Finally, we examine some developments in mycology and biotechnology that have implications for agriculture and pinpoint opportunities for increased collaboration between botanists and agricultural scientists.'

Abstract: 'The relationships between leaf nitrogen (N), specific leaf area (SLA) (an inverse index of leaf \xe2\x80\x9cthickness\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdensity\xe2\x80\x9d), and photosynthetic capacity (Amax) were studied in 23 Amazonian tree species to characterize scaling in these properties among natural populations of leaves of different ages and light microenvironments, and to examine how variation within species in N and SLA can influence the expression of the Amax-to-N relationship on mass versus area bases. The slope of the Amax-N relationship, change in A per change in N (\xce\xbcmol CO2 gN-1 s-1), was consistently greater, by as much as 300%, when both measures were expressed on mass rather than area bases. The x-intercept of this relationship (N-compensation point) was generally positive on a mass but not an area basis. In this paper we address the causes and implications of such differences. Significant linear relationships (p<0.05) between mass-based leaf N (Nmass) and SLA were observed in 12 species and all 23 regressions had positive slopes. In 13 species, mass-based Amax (Amass) was positively related (p<0.05) with SLA. These patterns reflect the concurrent decline in Nmass and SLA with increasing leaf age. Significant (p<0.05) relationships between area-based leaf N (Narea) and SLA were observed in 18 species. In this case, all relationships had negative slopes. Taken collectively, and consistent in all species, as SLA decreased (leaves become \xe2\x80\x9cthicker\xe2\x80\x9d) across increasing leaf age and light gradients, Nmass also decreased, but proportionally more slowly, such that Narea increased. Due to the linear dependence of Amass on Nmass and a negative 4-intercept, \xe2\x80\x9cthicker\xe2\x80\x9d leaves (low SLA) therefore tend, on average, to have lower Nmass and Amass but higher Narea than \xe2\x80\x9cthinner\xe2\x80\x9d leaves. This tendency towards decreasing Amass with increasing Narea, resulting in a lower slope of the Amax-N relationship on an area than mass basis in 16 of 17 species where both were significant. For the sole species exception (higher area than mass-based slope) variation in Narea was related to variation in Nmass and not in SLA, and thus, these data are also consistent with this explanation. The relations between N, SLA and Amax explain how the rate of change in Amax per change in N can vary three-fold depending on whether a mass or area mode of expression is used.'

Abstract: 'The improved valuation techniques that have expanded the range of benefit-cost analysis assume the likelihood and intensities of impacts from development projects can be predicted. Techniques for prediction address the impacts of the project on the environment and society, but indirect relationships - the impact on society and thereby the environment - are too numerous, subtle, and complex to model. Even if these indirect relationships could be modeled systematically, predictive models must assume factors and relationships are fixed or change in predetermined ways. Projects do not perform as predicted and benefit-cost analyses have limited value because the characteristics of factors and relationships in fact evolve in unpredictable ways over time. In some cases evolution results in further gains, but typically this has not been the case. The use of coevolutionary development criteria would help in the design of projects which would more likely evolve in preferred ways.'

Abstract: 'We studied the conditions that permit the shrub, Cordia multispicata, to establish in Amazon pastures and the potential role of this shrub as a \xe2\x80\x98succession facilitator\xe2\x80\x99 near the town of Paragominas, Par\xc3\xa1 State, Brazil. Local disturbances that reduce cover such as grazing and burning helped C. multispicata establish in pastures in active use. Germination of C. multispicata was significantly improved on sites subjected to simulated grazing and seedling growth was hastened following pasture burning. We found that below-ground competition, evaluated using root ingrowth cores, was reduced by burning and grazing. Recently abandoned pastures are frequently composed of a mix of forbs and grasses but as succession proceeds a mosaic of more discrete vegetation patches appears. At our site, a five-year-old abandoned pasture, grass patches (primarily Panicum maximum) and shrub patches (mainly C. multispicata) were common. We compared physical and biotic characteristics of zones dominated by C. multispicata and P. maximum and found: (1) the rain of bat and bird dispersed seeds of woody species was much greater in the zones of C. multispicata (92 seeds/m2/year) than in the patches of grass (6 seeds/m2/year); (2) the density of woody seedlings was eight times greater in the C. multispicata patches (0.65/m2) than in the zones of P. maximum (0.08 woody individuals/m2); (3) soil nutrient availability and litter nutrient concentrations were greater in the shrub zones than in the grass zones; and (4) photosynthetic photon flux density at the soil surface was generally more favorable for rainforest tree seedling growth in C. multispicata patches (16% of full sunlight) as compared to the grass zones (7.7% of full sun). We conclude that the shrub, C. multispicata, acts as a magnet, attracting volant seed vectors, and as a nurse plant, facilitating the establishment of woody species in abandoned Amazon pastures.'

Abstract: 'Subsistence hunting among the Waimiri Atroari Indians in central Amazonia, Brazil, was studied from September 1993 to October 1994 to assess the current levels of resource exploitation. Hunting effort, harvesting yields and species composition of the hunt were recorded daily in five villages varying in number of people, location and age of the settlement. The Waimiri Atroari harvested a total of 3004 individuals of 41 species in one year. Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (T. tajacu) and spider monkey (Ateles paniscus) represented 87% of the total yearly game weight. Sex ratios of spider monkeys killed were heavily biased towards females indicating a stronger hunting pressure on those individuals. Harvesting yields was proportional to hunting efforts indicating no evident game depletion in the study period. However, capture per unit of effort was significantly different among villages. Differences in total game mass harvested may be explained by local resource depletion associated with age and size of the settlement. However, this relationship is confounded by the capacity of some villages to exploit distant hunting sites. Data obtained in one village showed that harvest rates were higher in hunting sites located far from settlement indicating game depletion in hunting sites surrounding the village.'

Abstract: 'Ethnobotanists use a variety of interview techniques to collect ethnobotanical data. Drawing upon the results from a quantitative ethnobotanical study in five Yuracar\xc3\xa9 and Trinitario communities in the Bolivian Amazon, the pros and cons of the following methods are evaluated: (1) interviews in situ during transects, walk-in-the-woods, and homegarden sampling; and (2) interviews ex situ with fresh plant material, voucher specimens, or plant photographs as reference tools. Although the systematic use of plant photographs for ethnobotanical interviews is poorly documented in literature, the results show that indigeno\xc3\xb9s participants in our study recognize significantly more plant species from photographs than from voucher specimens. It is argued that, especially in remote and isolated study sites, photographs might be advantageous over voucher specimens.'

Abstract: 'Stomata control CO2 uptake and transpirational water loss, and their functioning is closely regulated by external factors, such as light, CO2 concentration, air vapor pressure deficit, and temperature. In addition, endogenous factors (e.g. biological clock) also affect stomatal movement. In comparison with ambient factors, internal factors have received less attention in Amazonian tree species. The aim of this study was to determine how stomatal functioning and photosynthesis respond to continuous light exposure during a circadian cycle. We collected data from July to September 2010 in four saplings of Amphirrhox surinamensis. Stomatal conductance (g s50) and photosynthesis at a constant photosynthetically active radiation of 50\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 (P N50) were measured continuously during a circadian period (24\xc2\xa0h, day and night) under a [CO2] of 380\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5mol\xc2\xa0mol\xe2\x88\x921, temperature of 25\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, air relative humidity of 73\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa03\xc2\xa0%. The highest values of g s50 and P N50 were observed before 02:00\xc2\xa0pm. Values of these parameters decreased toward the end of the afternoon and night until reaching steady state around midnight. Stomatal reopening (inferred by the increase in g s values) began after midnight (01:00 am\xe2\x80\x9302:00 am) when lower temperatures were recorded. Cooler temperatures observed after midnight and higher vapor pressure deficit values recorded early in the morning should promote closing rather than stomatal opening. Stomatal reopening in the early predawn hours suggests the involvement of an endogenous timer (circadian clock) in stomatal functioning.'

Abstract: 'The objective of eliminating foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Brazil has been mainly motivated by the constant preoccupation of Brazilian authorities, livestock breeders and the meat industry with avoiding economic losses due to export restrictions. In 1934, the first national sanitary legislation was enacted, and the Pan-American Foot and Mouth Disease Center in Rio de Janeiro was inaugurated in 1951, with international participation. An overview is given of the past campaigns against FMD, the legislation, policies and field activities. The reasons for the failure of the past campaigns are discussed. The structure of the existing campaign and the present epidemiological situation are explained, and the further possibilities of being recognized as an FMD-free country are discussed.'

Abstract: 'M\xc3\xbcllerian mimicry, in which both partners are unpalatable to predators, is often used as an example of a coevolved mutualism. However, it is theoretically possible that some M\xc3\xbcllerian mimics are parasitic if a weakly defended mimic benefits at the expense of a more highly defended model, a phenomenon known as \xe2\x80\x98quasi-Batesian mimicry\xe2\x80\x99. The theory expounded by M\xc3\xbcller and extended here for unequal unpalatability, on the other hand, suggests that quasi-Batesian mimicry should be rare in comparison with classical, or mutualistic M\xc3\xbcllerian mimicry. Evolutionarily, quasi-Batesian mimicry has consequences similar to classical Batesian mimicry, including unilateral \xe2\x80\x98advergence\xe2\x80\x99 of the mimic to the model, and diversifying frequency-dependent selection on the mimic which may lead to mimetic polymorphism. In this paper, theory and empirical evidence for mutual benefit and coevolution in M\xc3\xbcllerian mimicry are reviewed. I use examples from well-known insect M\xc3\xbcllerian mimicry complexes: the Limenitis\xe2\x80\x93Danaus (Nymphalidae) system in North America, the Bombus\xe2\x80\x93Psithyrus (Apidae) system in the north temperate zone, and the Heliconius\xe2\x80\x93Laparus (Nymphalidae) system in tropical America. These give abundant evidence for unilateral advergence, and no convincing evidence, to my knowledge, for coevolved mutual convergence. Furthermore, mimetic polymorphisms are not uncommon. Yet classical mutualistic M\xc3\xbcllerian mimicry, coupled with spatial (and possibly temporal) variation in model abundances convincingly explain these apparent anomalies without recourse to a quasi-Batesian explanation. Nevertheless, the case against classical M\xc3\xbcllerian mimicry is not totally disproved, and should be investigated further. I hope that this tentative analysis of actual mimicry rings may encourage others to look for evidence of coevolution and quasi-Batesian effects in a variety of other M\xc3\xbcllerian mimicry systems.'

Abstract: 'Understanding and predicting ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon and water fluxes) and the role of soils in carbon storage requires an accurate assessment of plant rooting distributions. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare distributions for various plant functional groups. We compiled a database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into 11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient \xce\xb2 to the data for each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). \xce\xb2 is a simple numerical index of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-\xce\xb2d, where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. High values of \xce\xb2 correspond to a greater proportion of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles (\xce\xb2=0.913, 0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80\xe2\x80\x9390% of roots in the top 30 cm of soil; deserts and temperate coniferous forests showed the deepest profiles (\xce\xb2=0.975 and 0.976, respectively) and had only 50% of their roots in the upper 30 cm. Standing root biomass varied by over an order of magnitude across biomes, from approximately 0.2 to 5 kg m-2. Tropical evergreen forests had the highest root biomass (5 kg m-2), but other forest biomes and sclerophyllous shrublands were of similar magnitude. Root biomass for croplands, deserts, tundra and grasslands was below 1.5 kg m-2. Root/shoot (R/S) ratios were highest for tundra, grasslands, and cold deserts (ranging from 4 to 7); forest ecosystems and croplands had the lowest R/S ratios (approximately 0.1 to 0.5). Comparing data across biomes for plant functional groups, grasses had 44% of their roots in the top 10 cm of soil. (\xce\xb2=0.952), while shrubs had only 21% in the same depth increment (\xce\xb2=0.978). The rooting distribution of all temperate and tropical trees was \xce\xb2=0.970 with 26% of roots in the top 10 cm and 60% in the top 30 cm. Overall, the globally averaged root distribution for all ecosystems was \xce\xb2=0.966 (r2=0.89) with approximately 30%, 50%, and 75% of roots in the top 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm, respectively. We discuss the merits and possible shortcomings of our analysis in the context of root biomass and root functioning.'

Abstract: "Agricultural studies in seasonally flooded areas in the tropics have been limited. Orinoco alluvial soils are more fertile than adjacent non-flooded soils, and have been considered as potential areas for further agricultural development. Traditional agroforestry practices offer some possibilities to overcome the most limiting factors of floodplain cultivation. Indigenous knowledge of these traditional agroforestry practices was assessed and some indicators of the system's nitrogen and biomass dynamics were monitored. Nitrogen inputs by sediment and plant residues were 1668 and 47 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. Traditional selection of sediment by tree-and-grass barriers and litter management strategies increase nutrient-use efficiency in floodplain agroecosystems."

Abstract: 'Droughts have dramatic direct and indirect impacts on vegetation and terrestrial ecosystem stability, including decreases in growth and subsequent decreases in CO2 absorption. Although much research has been carried out on the response of vegetation to droughts, it remains unclear whether biomes are becoming more resistant or more vulnerable to drought. In this study, we used the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, a multiscalar drought index) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, an indicator of vegetation growth) to detect the sensitivity of vegetation growth to droughts across 12\xe2\x80\x9324 month timescales and to detect the change in this sensitivity over recent decades. We found that vegetation growth was most sensitive to 17\xe2\x80\x9318 month droughts in water-limited regions, implying pronounce legacy effects from water conditions in previous years. In addition, we detected reduced coupling between drought and vegetation growth, probably caused by release moisture stress in water limited areas. Meanwhile, we observed a shortening of drought timescale to which vegetation most sensitively responded from an average of 18.1 to 17.2 months, suggesting the weakening of the drought legacy effect on vegetation growth. Results of this study contribute to the overall understanding of the resistance and resilience of ecosystems to drought conditions.'

Abstract: 'Strongyluris oscari Travassos, 1923, parasite of Topidurus torquatus (Wied-Neuwied, 1820) (Tropiduridae) from Brazil and Pharyngodon mamillatus (Linstow, 1897) of Chalcides ocellatus (Forskal, 1775) (Scincidae) from Egypt, were redescribed based on light and scanning electron microscopy, and re-evaluation of specimens from parasitological collections. The following features were accurately observed in S. oscari for the first time: structure of lips and pharyngeal valve, presence and distribution of somatic papillae, number and arrangement of caudal papillae, presence of inner sclerotised structures supporting the ventral sucker and the ventral region in tail of males, and structure of the posterior anal lip in females. The unpaired papilla on the inferior edge of the ventral sucker in males of S. oscari is a cuticular groove instead of a true papilla. Regarding the morphology of P. mamillatus the following features were given in details for the first time: structure of the cephalic end in both male and female, location of amphids, position of phasmids in females and the accurate morphology of caudal bursa in males, including the distribution of caudal papillae and the genital cone morphology. Strongyluris oscari and P. mamillatus have no intraspecific morphological variations, but wide range on biometric features. These variations may be accounted by host/environment attributes, since they exhibit wide host and geographical spectra. The present results increased the morphological knowledge of P. mamillatus and S. oscari, strengthening their taxonomic validity.'

Abstract: 'Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes can be found in almost every major city of Brazil and are vectors of filariasis and several arboviruses. Microsatellite markers have been widely used to uncover the genetic structure of various groups of insect populations. The aim of this study was to glimpse the genetic structure of Cx. quinquefasciatus in Brazil.'

Abstract: "A series of experiments was done using an atmospheric general circulation model to simulate climates from full glacial time at 18 ka (thousands of years before the present) to the present at 3000 year intervals, and at 126 ka, the previous interglacial period. A modified K\xc3\xb6ppen climate classification was developed to aid in the interpretation of the results of the circulation model experiments. The climate classification scheme permits the characterization of eleven distinct seasonal temperature and precipitation regimes. For the modern climate, the modified classification agrees well with a classification of natural vegetation zones, and provides an easily-assimilated depiction of climate changes resulting from the varying boundary conditions in the past. At 18 ka, the time of glacial maximum, 45% of the land surface had climate classifications different from the present. At 126 ka, a time when northern hemisphere summer radiation was much greater than at present owing to changes in the date of perihelion and tilt of the earth's axis, the corresponding difference was 32%. For all experiments -3 to 18 ka and 126 ka - only 30% of the land surface showed no change in climate classification from the present. Core areas showing no change included the Amazon basin, the northern Sahara and Australia."

Abstract: 'Although debate continues, there is agreement that dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) were first domesticated in Eurasia, spreading from there to other parts of the world. However, while that expansion already extended as far as Europe, China, and North America by the early Holocene, dogs spread into (and south of) the tropics only much later. In South America, for example, the earliest well-attested instances of their presence do not reach back much beyond 3000\xc2\xa0cal. BC, and dogs were still absent from large parts of the continent\xe2\x80\x94Amazonia, the Gran Chaco, and much of the Southern Cone\xe2\x80\x94at European contact. Previous explanations for these patterns have focused on cultural choice, the unsuitability of dogs for hunting certain kinds of tropical forest prey, and otherwise unspecified environmental hazards, while acknowledging that Neotropical lowland forests witness high rates of canine mortality. Building on previous work in sub-Saharan Africa (Mitchell in Archaeol Res Afr 50:92\xe2\x80\x93135, 2015), and noting that the dog\xe2\x80\x99s closest relatives, the grey wolf (C. lupus) and the coyote (C. latrans), were likewise absent from South and most of Central America in pre-Columbian times, this paper explores instead the possibility that infectious disease constrained the spread of dogs into Neotropical environments. Four diseases are considered, all likely to be native and/or endemic to South America: canine distemper, canine trypanosomiasis, canine rangeliosis, and canine visceral leishmaniasis caused by infection with Leishmania amazonensis and L. colombiensis. The paper concludes by suggesting ways in which the hypothesis that disease constrained the expansion of dogs into South America can be developed further.'

Abstract: ' Valuation of Forests and Plant Species in Indigenous Territory and National Park Isiboro-S\xc3\xa9cure, Bolivia. A quantitative ethnobotanical study was conducted in Indigenous Territory and National Park Isiboro-S\xc3\xa9cure (TIPNIS), Bolivia, to assess the usefulness assigned by local Yuracar\xc3\xa9 and Trinitario ethnic groups to different terra firme and floodplain forests. Furthermore, we investigated which variables are good predictors for the use value attributed to plant species in the research area. Plants were collected during transect, walk-in-the-woods and homegarden sampling. Ethnobotanical and ethnoecological data of the inventoried plants were obtained from 12 Yuracar\xc3\xa9 and 14 Trinitario participants through semistructured interviews. On average, 84% of species in transects were claimed to be useful to people. The understorey (2.5\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89dbh\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0cm) of the sampled forest types contained more useful species than the overstorey (dbh\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0cm), particularly for species with a medicinal and/or social use function. The local use value of plant species can be predicted, in part, from their botanical family, growth form, density, frequency, mean and maximum dbh, and ecological importance value. Our data confirm the hypothesis that density and frequency of plants in the landscape are both related to perceived plant accessibility. Accessibility of plants partly seems to guide their usefulness in TIPNIS. Indigenous assessment of accessibility and abundance of plants also covaried with their perceived usefulness and therefore has a potential for uncovering patterns in the perceived utility of plants.'

Abstract: 'Plant biomass, mineral composition and the amounts of nutrients in the different fractions of the vegetation were determined for a dense dry deciduous forest growing on light red sands in south-western Madagascar. Complete harvesting and soil coring were used to determine the above- and below-ground biomass respectively. The above-ground biomass, weighing 118\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (dry matter), was mostly (96%) made up of phanerophytes (woody trees and shrubs >25\xc2\xa0cm tall). Dead material (litter and dead wood on the soil surface) represented 13.8\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. These results fit well into the range of values reported for other tropical ecosystems. The below-ground biomass was 17.8\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 giving a root/shoot ratio of 0.15. Rooting is superficial. The nutrient concentration in this dry forest on light reddish-brown sands is, as in other dry forests, considerably higher than that usually found for humid forests. Calcium is the most abundant element. The plant biomass Ca/K ratio is much higher than that of humid tropical forests. In spite of its high originality, this Madagascan dry forest has the same behaviour as other dry forests of the world.'

Abstract: 'At Panguana, a study in the upper Amazon basin, 7 different aquatic breeding sites of anurans were investigated from Nov. 1, 1981 to Oct. 31, 1982. Rainfall in this area is seasonal. Only 20% of the total annual precipitation was maesured during the dry period, which lasted from mid-March until mid-September 1982. The reproductive periods of the species were highly affected by the rainfall distribution. Calling males and/or gravid females of 46 species were found during the study period. 37.0% of the anuran species were exclusively, and 43.5% predominantly, active during the rainy season. Plots of 100 m2 were established at 6 aquatic sites in primary rainforest. A total of 2126 frogs was counted; 93.2% of these were made during the rainy season. A maximum of 378 individuals were found during one check in the plot at the permanent pond. At this site high concentrations of individuals and large choruses were found at the beginning of the rainy season. As soon as favourable temporary aquatic sites were established, reproductive activities decreased at the permanent pond and increased at temporary breeding sites.'

Abstract: 'Global tropical deforestation continues to occur at high rates despite political attention. National-level forest baselines are being established all over the world to guide the implementation of several policy mechanisms. However, identifying the direct and indirect drivers of deforestation and understanding the complexity of their interlinkages are often difficult. We first analyzed deforestation between 1990 and 2005 at the national level and found an annual deforestation rate of 0.62\xc2\xa0%. Next, we performed separate analyses for four natural regions in Colombia and found annual deforestation rates between 0.42 and 1.92\xc2\xa0%. Using general linear models, we identified several direct causes and underlying factors influencing deforestation at the national level: rural population density, cattle, protected areas, and slope. Significant differences in deforestation rates and causes were found across regions. In the Caribbean region, drivers of loss are urban population, unsatisfied basic needs, slope, and precipitation and four land use variables (illicit crops, pastures, cattle, and fires). In the Orinoco region, crops are the main driver of forest loss, and in the Amazonian region, deforestation is primarily due to fires related to the colonization front. Policy mechanisms will have to take into account regional patterns to successfully balance development and forest preservation in Colombia.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated the distribution, percentage, and homogeneous regions of fire foci in Brazil over 1998\xe2\x80\x932011. Included are numbers of fire foci by regions and states as well as their seasonal and monthly variations, with emphasis on human activities and their relationships with producing systems and rainfall inhibitors. We used data from forest fire meteorological satellites, obtained from the Centro de Previs\xc3\xa3o do Tempo e Estudos Clim\xc3\xa1ticos. Evaluation of regional fire foci distributions gave 37.15\xc2\xa0% for the central west and just 1.75\xc2\xa0% in the south. Brazilian regions with the highest densities of forest fires per unit area were the northeast, central west, and north. Lowest densities were in the north, southeast, and south. The states of Mato Grosso, Par\xc3\xa1, Maranh\xc3\xa3o, Bahia, Rond\xc3\xb4nia, and Tocantins had the greatest numbers of fire foci during our study period. The Federal District and the states of Sergipe, Esp\xc3\xadrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, and Alagoas had the smallest numbers. Spring (62.2\xc2\xa0%) and winter (28.7\xc2\xa0%) had higher frequencies than summer (6.7\xc2\xa0%) and autumn (2.7\xc2\xa0%). A clustering technique showed three homogeneous regions of fire foci in Brazil. The regional grouping technique showed the influence of synoptic systems and large-scale patterns of fires in the country. In addition to the use of NOAA-12 satellite images for monitoring Brazilian fire foci, orbital platforms such as MMODIS-01D and T-AQUA can be used. Finally, anthropogenic activities (deforestation, agriculture, livestock, mining, and industrial) and the variability of meteorological systems affected the fire increase during the study period.'

Abstract: 'A phytosociological study was carried out in four 1-ha forest plots in the Sierra Maigualida region, Venezuelan Guayana. Density, dominance, and frequency values were calculated as well as the species and family importance values (FIVs) in each plot. A total of 65 families, 232 genera and 533 species were represented in the 4\xe2\x80\x89ha of forest. The number of stems \xe2\x89\xa510\xe2\x80\x89cm\xe2\x80\x89dbh varied from 355 to 563, the number of species from 133 to 191, the genera from 76 to 120, the families from 38 to 51, and the basal area from 20.56 to 40.83\xe2\x80\x89m2 per hectare. Overall the most species rich family was Fabaceae (38 species), the most numerous in total stems was Burseraceae (165 individuals), and the most dominant in terms of basal area was Sapotaceae (1367.13\xe2\x80\x89cm2). The most conspicuous families, as represented among the top five FIV, include Burseraceae in all four plots, Moraceae in three of the plots, and Sapotaceae in two plots. Less than 20% of the total inventory of species are represented in two or more plots. The percentages of species which are unique to a single plot range from 56 to 67%. The within-plot diversities recorded in the present study indicate that the Sierra Maiguailida harbors the richest forests thus far documented in Venezuelan Guayana. Meanwhile, the low between-plot similarity indices reinforce the notion that the species richness of this region is unusually high and suggest the need to extend collections and inventory studies.'

Abstract: 'Institutional and policy issues are now recognized as high priority items in agroforestry research. However, such studies based on actual field experiences seldom seem to have been undertaken. To help address this deficiency, a study was undertaken in Ecuador to evaluate institutional and policy impacts on agroforestry dissemination using two field projects as case studies.'

Abstract: 'We tested the hypothesis that the growth of fine roots upward into the leaf litter, forming a \xe2\x80\x98surface root mat\xe2\x80\x99, found widely in Amazonian forests, is of adaptive value for plants of poor soils because it makes possible more rapid uptake of limiting nutrients. We assessed the effect of invasion by fine roots on the rates of loss of dry mass and nutrient content of leaf litter over 1 year in three plots in each of three contrasting forest types in central Amazonia: the stunted facies of heath forest known as campina (SHF), the taller facies of heath forest known as campinarana (THF), both on spodosols, and the surrounding lowland evergreen rain forest (LERF) on ultisol. Pairs of bags filled with freshly fallen leaves from the trees of Clitoria fairchildiana (Fabaceae) were placed on the litter layer; in order to prevent roots entering the control bag in each pair that bag was lifted from the forest floor and turned over each week, while the treatment bag was left undisturbed. From each plot, four pairs of litter bags were retrieved after 30, 60, 120, 180, 270 and 360\xc2\xa0d, and all roots that had grown into the litterbags were carefully removed. The leaves and roots from each bag were oven-dried for nutrient analysis. In no forest type was there a significant difference in the rate of loss of dry matter from the litter between the bags with and without roots. The amounts of roots invading the litter bags increased significantly in the sequence SHF\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0THF\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0LERF. In no forest did the presence of roots have a significant effect on the rate of disappearance of N or P from the leaf material, or on the rate of accumulation of Fe and Al. In the SHF there was no significant effect of invasion by roots on the rates of disappearance of Ca, Mg, Mn or Zn, but in the THF, the rates of disappearance of these four elements between 270 and 360\xc2\xa0d were significantly greater in the presence of roots. In the LERF the results were similar, but the effects of roots started earlier\xe2\x80\x94the rates of disappearance of Ca and Mg were significantly enhanced between 120 and 360\xc2\xa0d. The results from the SHF may be interpreted to suggest that the growth of fine roots (and their fungal associates) upward into leaf litter is unlikely to be explained wholly by their role in the efficient recovery of mineral nutrients.'

Abstract: 'Pico da Neblina National Park, located in north-western Amazonia,Brazil, is characterized by considerable habitat diversity resulting from anorographic zonation of vegetation (from 100 to 3,014 m above sealevel) and a mosaic pattern of soil types with lowland primary tropicalrainforest being the predominant ecosystem. A tree inventory of the lowlandareas of the Park was conducted as part of an ecological study of primates. Twohectares of forest were inventoried within the limits of a 500 hectare studysite. There were 1569 trees with diameter at breast height \xe2\x89\xa510 cm in the sample (minimum of 229 species in 45 families). Thetree species Eperua leucantha and Hevea cf.brasiliensis dominated the forest accounting for 29% of thesampled trees. Three forest types were represented: chavascal, terra firme andcaatinga. Caatinga was the least diverse forest (H\xe2\x80\xb2 = 0.9), andterrafirme the most diverse (H\xe2\x80\xb2 = 1.5). Low diversity in caatinga wasassociated with high species dominance by Eperua leucantha, Micrandrasprucei and Hevea cf. brasiliensis whichtogether accounted for 66% of all sampled trees in one caatinga plot.Compared to Amazonian forests elsewhere, the ranking order of plant families inPico da Neblina was peculiar in that Leguminosae sensulatuand Euphorbiaceae dominated the sample accounting for 52% of all markedtrees. Such families were represented by few tree species, all of which werecharacterized by dry, large-seeded sclerocarpic fruits. The consequentlow availability of fleshy fruits in the forest is suggested as a possiblecontributing factor to the observed low abundance and diversity of primates inthe lowlands of Pico da Neblina.'

Abstract: 'This paper addresses two issues. The first issue relates directly to transnational corporations, while the second issue is broader and relates to all diversely held companies. To address the first issue I cite three representative instances where wanton environmental damage has signalled a lack of moral judgment on the part of a transnational corporation. I conclude from these instances that ethical considerations are not given adequate weight in corporate investment decisions.'

Abstract: 'Certain patterns in soil bacterial diversity and community composition have become evident from metagenomics studies on a range of scales, from various parts of the world. For example, soil pH has generally been seen as dominating variation in bacterial diversity, above all other soil and climate parameters. It is important however to test the generality of these relationships by studying previously un-sampled areas. We compared soil bacterial diversity and community composition under a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions in mountainous Yunnan Province, SW China. Soil samples were taken from a range of primary forest types and altitudes, reflecting the great variation of forest environments in this region. From each soil sample, DNA was extracted and pyrosequenced for bacterial 16S rRNA gene identification. In contrast to other recent studies from other parts of the world, pH was a weaker predictor of bacterial community composition and diversity than exchangeable Ca2+ concentration, and also the more poorly defined environmental parameter of elevation. Samples from within each forest type clustered strongly, showing the distinctive pattern of their microbial communities on a regional scale. It is clear that on a regional scale in a very heterogeneous environment, additional factors beyond pH can emerge as more important in determining bacterial diversity.'

Abstract: 'Big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) is the woody species with the highest economic value in Latin America. Currently, it is subject to intensive exploitation, diminishing its natural populations. Due to this decline, the species is a preferred species for reforestation and establishment of commercial tropical plantations. Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a biotic factor scarcely studied in the ecology of this species. Therefore, the objective of this research was to identify the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species associated with the rhizosphere of seedlings and mature trees of big-leaf mahogany growing in its natural habitat, a tropical rain forest in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Soil samples from a 20-cm depth were taken from the rhizosphere of big-leaf mahogany seedlings and mature trees. Additionally, spores from the rhizosphere soil were propagated on Sorghum vulgare, isolated and identified. The percentage of AMF colonization was also evaluated.'

Abstract: 'Movement is a fundamental feature of vertebrate behavior and can modify processes within populations and communities. Because tropical avian frugivores disperse seeds of many plant species, the temporal and spatial patterning of their movement will influence seed distribution within a habitat. To date, little is known about movement patterns of these birds. Here we consider the movement of an understory frugivore, Mionectes oleagineus. Movements of 16 non-breeding females were monitored using continuous radio-telemetry to provide a general description of movement patterns and to examine the fractal geometry of the spatial component of movement. Most movements were of short distance and duration, with the frequency distributions of both measures strongly skewed to the left. Over the range of measurement scales considered, the fractal dimension of M. oleagineus\xe2\x80\x99s movement increased with increasing measurement scale up to ca.100 m, whereafter it appeared to flatten out. We combined movement data with M. oleagineus gut-passage rates for seeds of six plant species to predict seed shadows. Estimated seed shadows were leptokurtic for four of the six plant species, with median dispersal distances for all species from 42 to 56 m. Dispersal distances were of the order of reported pollen dispersal distances, suggesting that even small seed dispersers like M. oleagineus can provide significant dispersal for plant genotypes. Gut-passage rate appears to determine the shape of the seed shadow, while movement determines dispersal scale.'

Abstract: 'Among 13 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, species with high seedling mortality rates during the first year in shade had higher reltive growth rates (RGR) from germination to 2 months in both sun (23% full sun) and shade [2%, with and without lowered red: far red (R:FR) ratio] than shade tolerant species. Species with higher RGR in sun also had higher RGR in shade. These interspecific trends could be explained by differences in morphological traits and allocation paterns among species. Within each light regime, seedlings of shade-intolerant species had lower root: shoot ratios, higher leaf mass per unit area, and higher leaf area ratios (LAR) than shade tolerant species. In contrast, leaf gas exchange characteristics, or acclimation potential in these traits, had no relationship with seedling mortality rates in shade. In both shade tolerant and intolerant species, light saturated photosynthesis rates, dark respiration, and light compensation points were higher for sungrown seedlings than for shade-grown seedlings. Differences in R:FR ratio in shade did not affect gas exchange, allocation patterns, or growth rates of any species. Survival of young tree seedlings in shade did not depend on higher net photosynthesis or biomass accumulation rates in shade. Rather, species with higher RGR died faster in shade than species with lower RGR. This trend could be explained if survival depends on morphological characteristics likely to enhance defense against herbivores and pathogens, such as dense and tough leaves, a well-established root system, and high wood density. High construction costs for these traits, and low LAR as a consequence of these traits, should result in lower rates of whole-plant carbon gain and RGR for shade tolerant species than shade-intolerant species in shade as well as in sun.'

Abstract: 'Ants are important components of ecosystems not only because they constitute a great part of the animal biomass but also because they act as ecosystem engineers. Ant biodiversity is incredibly high and these organisms are highly responsive to human impact, which obviously reduces its richness. However, it is not clear how such disturbance damages the maintenance of ant services to the ecosystem. Ants are important in below ground processes through the alteration of the physical and chemical environment and through their effects on plants, microorganisms, and other soil organisms. This review summarizes the information available on ant biodiversity patterns, how it can be quantified, and how biodiversity is affected by human impacts such as land use change, pollution, invasions, and climate change. The role of ants in ecosystems is discussed, mainly from the perspective of the effects of ground-dwelling ants on soil processes and function, emphasizing their role as ecosystem engineers. Some lines of research are suggested after demonstrating the gaps in our current information on ant-soil interactions.'

Abstract: 'A wilt disease of Eucalyptus associated with Pseudomonas solanacearum Biovar 1 is described. This disease has resulted in mortality of up to 17% of 6-month-old transplants of E. pellita in plantations on lands recently cleared of rainforest in equatorial Brazil. In plots previously planted with E. deglupta or Gmelina arborea mortality was less than 3%. In 2- to 3-year-old E. urophylla the disease is also associated with secondary decay, termite attack and increased susceptibility to windthrow. There are indications that one provenance of E. deglupta, one of E. pellita and two of E. tereticornis may be tolerant to bacterial wilt.'

Abstract: 'Accelerated natural regeneration (ANR) is a relatively cheap method of reforestation, which encourages natural establishment of indigenous trees and shrubs. It requires a low input of labour, but a high input of ecological information. In this paper, the knowledge required to predict and manipulate the natural regeneration of seasonal tropical forest is reviewed and areas in need of further research are identified. Regeneration will be influenced by five groups of potentially limiting factors; site resources (soil and microclimate); competition with weeds; site disturbance; occurrence of established woody plants or their propagules; seed dispersal by wild animals and birds. This paper considers each of these, their interactions with seasons, and each other. Collation of existing information on these topics, combined with the suggested further research, should facilitate the creation of tools that will enable practitioners to judge the regeneration potential of sites and to select the most appropriate ANR techniques.'

Abstract: 'Various species of frogs and toads, belonging to the genera Bufo, Atelopus, Dendrobates, Colostethus, and Eleutherodactylus, occur in the leaf litter in rainforest in Panam\xc3\xa1. This study compares the litter communities at two sites in Panam\xc3\xa1: Pipeline Road, the drier site, and Carti Road, the wetter site. At both sites, frog abundance is greater in the dry season, when abundance of their prey, the litter arthropods, is greater. Species diversity does not change seasonally at either site; however, species diversity differs strikingly between sites, with Carti Road having the greater species diversity. Similarity in diet does not vary consistently with seasonal changes in food abundance at a single site or with differences in species diversity between sites. These results suggest that neither moisture nor food abundance alone influences the abundance or the diversity of litter frogs at these two sites in Panam\xc3\xa1.'

Abstract: 'High fertilizer input is necessary to sustain high yields in oil palm agroecosystems, but it may endanger neighboring aquatic ecosystems when excess nutrients are transported to waterways. In this study, the hydrochemical dynamics of groundwater and streams under baseflow conditions were evaluated with bi-monthly measurements for 1\xc2\xa0year on 16 watersheds. Hydrochemical measurements were related to the spatial distribution of soil and fertilization practices across a landscape of 100\xc2\xa0km2, dominated by oil palm cultivation, in Central Sumatra, Indonesia. The low nutrient concentrations recorded in streams throughout the landscape indicated that the mature oil palm plantations in this study did not contribute to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. This was ascribed to high nutrient uptake by oil palm, a rational fertilizer program, and dilution of nutrient concentrations due to heavy rainfall in the study area. Soil type controlled dissolved inorganic N and total P fluxes, with greater losses of N and P from loamy-sand uplands than loamy lowlands. Organic fertilization helped to reduce nutrient fluxes compared to mineral fertilizers. However, when K inputs exceeded the oil palm requirement threshold, high K export occurred during periods when groundwater had a short residence time. For higher nutrient use efficiency in the long term, the field-scale fertilizer management should be complemented with a landscape-scale strategy of fertilizer applications that accounts for soil variability.'

Abstract: 'The vertical distribution of the richness, abundance, and composition of epiphytic bryophytes was studied in a matrix of fragmented habitats in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest of the Murici Ecological Station (9\xc2\xb011\xe2\x80\xb205\xe2\x80\xb3\xe2\x80\x939\xc2\xb016\xe2\x80\xb248\xe2\x80\xb3\xc2\xa0S, 35\xc2\xb045\xe2\x80\xb220\xe2\x80\xb3\xe2\x80\x9335\xc2\xb055\xe2\x80\xb212\xe2\x80\xb3\xc2\xa0W), northeastern Brazil. The aim was to compare the horizontal (between sites) and vertical (between phorophyte heights) turnover to test a hypothesis based on niche width vulnerability. There was a highly significant decreasing of richness accompanying the loss of habitat, and the most conserved fragment housed a total richness more than 10 times higher than the less conserved fragment. Epiphytes failed to colonize lower trunks (2.1\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0m)  and higher zones in most of the non-conserved fragments; they were restricted to the base (0\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0m) and displayed a clear altered floristic composition. The species with restricted ecological amplitudes such as sun and shade tolerant taxa were more negatively affected by habitat loss than generalists. Although the mean richness of generalists decreased in non conserved fragments, the proportional contribution of this guild increased, proving that these taxa are the ones which persist in disturbed sites. The forest fragments capable of harboring rich epiphyte flora in the area studied are over 300\xc2\xa0ha in size, which is far from being a common size among Brazilian Atlantic rainforest fragments. Hence, our results highlight the need of conserving the few large remnants in this ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Forest resource conservation has been widely accepted as a key to sustain the local and regional economic development. The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations. Further studies are required to analyse the real patterns of regeneration and dynamic change due to human impact by long term monitoring with the establishment of permanent plots.'

Abstract: 'Large parts of the remaining tropical moist forests of South-east Asia are encroached at their margins by selective logging, rattan harvesting and the establishment of small agroforest plantations under the rainforest canopy. These slight to heavy disturbances affect aboveground forest structure by reducing wood biomass and canopy cover; however, they may also have a profound impact on the belowground compartment. In a lower montane moist forest of Central Sulawesi, we studied the profile totals of fine root biomass (FRBtot, roots <2\xc2\xa0mm until 50\xc2\xa0cm of soil depth) and of fine root necromass (FRNtot), the vertical distribution of fine root mass, and the fine root live/dead ratio by root coring in 12 forest stands that represented a gradient in forest use (or disturbance) intensity (forest use type A: undisturbed natural forest, B and C: slightly or moderately disturbed forests with selective timber extraction, D: heavily disturbed cacao agroforest systems under a remaining rainforest cover; each forest types being replicated three times). FRBtot decreased significantly from forest A to the disturbed B, C and D forests, and reached less than 60% of the FRBtot value of A in the agroforest systems D. A similar decrease with increasing disturbance intensity was found for FRNtot. Forest disturbance intensity had no significant influence on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the profiles. According to correlation and principal components analyses, fractional canopy cover was the most important factor influencing FRBtot and FRNtot, whereas diameter at breast height, stand basal area, stem density, soil pH and base saturation had only a minor or no influence on root mass. A reduction in canopy cover from 90% (forest type A) to 75% (types C and D) was associated with a reduction in FRBtot by about 45% which indicates that timber extraction leads not only to canopy gaps but to corresponding \xe2\x80\x98root gaps\xe2\x80\x99 in the soil as well. We conclude that forest encroachment that is widespread in large parts of South-east Asia\xe2\x80\x99s remaining rainforests significantly reduces tree fine root biomass and associated carbon sequestration, even if it is conducted at moderate intensities only.'

Abstract: ' Four species of epiphytic tank bromeliads on an island in the Orinoco river in Venezuelan Amazonia were inhabited by 13 ant species from four subfamilies. None of these ant species are known as specialised plant-ants. A Monte Carlo randomisation test showed that ants were randomly distributed among host plants: (1) there was no association between particular ant species and bromeliad species, and (2) there was no vertical stratification of the ant community between bromeliads sampled on the ground and at two height classes in trees. This contrasts with the few published data on the distribution of ants on terrestrial myrmecophytes and epiphytes, respectively, to which we applied the same analytical method.'

Abstract: '\nThe primary goal of this investigation is to focus on a \xe2\x80\x9crealistic\xe2\x80\x9d scenario for simulating impacts on regional African climate of future deforestation in a greenhouse-warmed world. Combined effects of plausible land-cover change and greenhouse warming are assessed by \xe2\x80\x98time-slice\xe2\x80\x99 simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) for the middle of the twenty first century. Three \xe2\x80\x9ctime-slice\xe2\x80\x9d integrations have been performed with the ARPEGE-Climat AGCM incorporating a zooming technique to achieve a resolution of about 100 km over Africa. A control run for the current climate is forced by observed climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the observed vegetation distribution is specified from a new vegetation database, in order to improve the geographical distribution and properties of the vegetation cover. Future SST changes are derived from a transient coupled atmosphere\xe2\x80\x93ocean simulation for scenario B2 of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Future vegetation changes are specified from a simulation of scenario B2 with the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) developed at the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands (RIVM). The results show that land surface processes can locally modulate greenhouse warming effects for African climate, with reductions of surface transpiration and small increases of surface temperature. Deforestation of tropical Africa has overall only a marginal effect on precipitation because of a compensatory increase in moisture convergence. Energy budget analyses show that increases in surface temperature are produced both by increases of greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration from the increase in downward atmospheric longwave radiation, and by African tropical deforestation from the resulting reduction in transpiration. This study indicates that realistic land-use changes, though of smaller amplitude than greenhouse gas forcing, may have a small regional effect in projections of future climate.'

Abstract: "Studies reported here explicate \xe2\x80\x9cquantity of coverage theory\xe2\x80\x9d (QCT), which explains how The New York Times and other US mass media are influential but not all powerful in setting the world's environmental risk agenda. Beginning in 1987, the Times and its news sources brought an array of global environmental problems \xe2\x80\x93 ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, rain forest destruction, and biodiversity \xe2\x80\x93 to American attention, and these concerns quickly spread to other nations. However, by 1991 journalists were turning to other news, and the \xe2\x80\x9cendangered earth\xe2\x80\x9d lost their importance as a public problem. News media of each nation pay most attention to their own problems. Beyond that natural consideration, it appears from a variety of data that foreign journalists attend more to risks regarded important in the US, than American journalists attend to risks regarded important elsewhere. This is well illustrated by the deep concern of Europeans and the European press about genetically modified food, an issue to which the US press and public remain largely indifferent. Sixteen nations, all participants in the International Social Survey Programme, measured risk perceptions in surveys given in 1993 and repeated in 2000. Between these years, changes in risk perception varied considerably from one nation to another. Filipinos, especially, but also the Spanish, Israelis, Russians, and Japanese considerably increased their ratings of danger for nearly all hazards. Conversely, Germans, Bulgarians, and the Irish saw the same hazards as less dangerous in 2000 than they did in 1993. Were changing risk perceptions the result of changes in media coverage within each nation? For ten of the 16 nations, trends in news coverage of \xe2\x80\x9cenvironment\xe2\x80\x9d could be obtained from computer databases. Except Ireland, the nations with rising news coverage were those with increasing perceptions of environmental danger, while nations with falling news coverage showed decreasing perceptions of environmental danger. These results support QCT. The implication of QCT for risk managers is inescapably simple: public concern about an alleged hazard waxes with increasing news coverage and wanes with diminishing coverage. The specific content of the news is not particularly relevant as long as it suggests the possibility of danger or simply of uncertainty."

Abstract: 'Exploring life\xe2\x80\x99s diversity and geography\xe2\x80\x99s effect on it was central to Darwin and Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s parallel discoveries of evolution.

Abstract: 'Descriptions of new tool-use events are important for understanding how ecological context may drive the evolution of tool use among primate traditions. Here, we report a possible case of the first record of tool use by wild Amazonian capuchin monkeys (Sapajus macrocephalus). The record was made by a camera trap, while we were monitoring caiman nest predation at Mamirau\xc3\xa1 Reserve in Central Amazonia. An adult individual was registered in a bipedal posture, apparently using a branch as a shovel to dig eggs out of a nest. Caiman eggs are frequently depredated by opportunistic animals, such as the capuchin monkeys. As the Mamirau\xc3\xa1 Reserve is covered by a high-productivity forest, and caiman eggs are a high-quality food resource seasonally available on the ground, we believe that tool use by capuchins is more likely to be opportunity driven, rather than necessity driven, in our study site.'

Abstract: 'We estimated carbon pools and emissions from deforestation in northern Argentine forests between 1900 and 2005, based on forest inventories, deforestation estimates from satellite images and historical data on forests and agriculture. Carbon fluxes were calculated using a book-keeping model. We ran 1000 simulations for a 105-year period with different combinations of values of carbon stocks (Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921), soil carbon in the top 0.2\xc2\xa0m, and annual deforestation series. The 1000 combinations of parameters were performed as a sensitivity analysis that for each run, randomly selected the values of each variable within a predefined range of values and probability distributions. Using the simulation outputs, we calculated the accumulated C emissions due to deforestation from 1900 to 2005 and the annual emission as the average of the 1000 simulations, and uncertainties of our estimates as the standard deviation. We found that northern Argentine forests contain an estimated 4.54\xc2\xa0Pg C (2.312 Pg C in biomass and 2.233 Pg C in soil). Between 1900 and 2005 approximately 30% of the forests were deforested, yielding carbon emissions of 0.945 (SD\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.270) Pg C. Estimated average annual carbon emissions between 1996 and 2005, mostly from deforestation of the Chaco dry forests, were 20,875 (SD\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06,156) Gg C y\xe2\x88\x921 (1 Gg\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x926 Pg). These values represent the largest source of carbon from land-cover change in the extra-tropical southern hemisphere, between 0.9 and 2.7% of the global carbon emissions from deforestation, and approximately 10% of carbon emissions from the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation, which has accelerated during the last decades as a result of modern agriculture expansion, represents a major national source of greenhouse gases and the second emission source, after fossil fuel consumption by fixed sources. We conclude that Argentine forests are an important carbon pool and emission source that need more attention for accurate global estimates, and seasonally dry forest deforestation is a key component of the Argentine carbon cycle.'

Abstract: 'The interrelationship between river flooding regime, topography, soil properties and the distribution of tree and bamboo species was analysed in an area of tropical semideciduous forest on the margins of the Rio Grande, in Madre de Deus de Minas, Southeastern Brazil. A survey was carried out in a single forest plot (1.597 ha, 71 adjacent 225 m2 quadrats) located in the inner side of a river bend and extending from the point bar to the top of the slope. All trees (\xe2\x89\xa55 cm diameter at the base of the trunk) and bamboo culms were registered. Soil samples were collected and analysed for their properties and the river level was monitored during a two year period. In the point bar the forest was dominated by only two tree species, Salix humboldtiana and Inga affinis, that tended to occur in distinct areas. Differences in soil properties between these areas suggest variation in sedimentation dynamics. In the sloping part of the plot, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the floristic composition was significantly correlated with three topographic sectors and their corresponding flood regimes. The Lower Slope corresponds to the sharp transition to the point bar forest, endures partial and annual floods and shows a very distinct flora that includes many light-demanding species. The Middle Slope is only occasionally reached by exceptional river floods and is characterised by a high density of the bamboo Merostachys neesii. The comparatively low density and basal area of trees, particularly for the smaller ones, provide evidence that the bamboos are problably interfering with the trees by restricting their recruitment. The Ridgetop lies entirely above the highest flooding level registered. The density of bamboos is lower and the understorey trees abundant.'

Abstract: 'Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of vegetation growth, we explored the characteristics and differences in the response to drought of five vegetation biomes in Northeast China, including typical steppe, desert steppe, meadow steppe, deciduous coniferous forest and deciduous broad-leaved forest during the period 1982\xe2\x80\x932009. The results indicate that growing season precipitation may be the primary vegetation growth-limiting factor in grasslands. More than 70% of the temporal variations in NDVI can be explained by the amount of precipitation during the growing season in typical and desert steppes. During the same period, the mean temperature in the growing season could explain nearly 43% of the variations in the mean growing season NDVI and is therefore a dominant growth-limiting factor for forest ecosystems. Therefore, the NDVI trends differ largely due to differences in the vegetation growth-limiting factors of the different vegetation biomes. The NDVI responses to droughts vary in magnitude and direction and depend on the drought-affected areas of the five vegetation types. Specifically, the changes in NDVI are consistent with the variations in precipitation for grassland ecosystems. A lack of precipitation resulted in decreases in NDVI, thereby reducing vegetation growth in these regions. Conversely, increasing precipitation decreased the NDVI of forest ecosystems. The results also suggest that grasslands under arid and semi-arid environments may be more sensitive to drought than forests under humid environments. Among grassland ecosystems, desert steppe was most sensitive to drought, followed by typical steppe; meadow steppe was the least sensitive.'

Abstract: ' I studied gray woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha cana)in an undisturbed central Amazonian terra firme forest, near the headwaters of the Urucu river, Tef\xc3\xa9, Amazonas, Brazil (5\xc2\xb050\xe2\x80\x99S, 65\xc2\xb016\xe2\x80\x99W). I report the diet and feeding ecology of a group of 39\xe2\x80\x9341 individuals, based on systematic feeding observations obtained during 11 months. Woolly monkeys are primarily frugivorous; mature fruits and young seeds account for 83 and 7% of 3298 feeding records, respectively. On a seasonal basis, however, they relied heavily on young foliage (16%), seed-pod exudates (6%), and flowers (3%), particularly during the greatest annual period of ripe fruit scarcity, as determined by a phenological survey. Animals represent only 0.1% of their year-round diet, and they spent little time capturing arthropods and other prey items. Although at least 225 plant species, belonging to 116 genera and 48 families, are in their diet, the three top-ranking families (Moraceae, Sapotaceae, and Leguminosae) account for 43% of their food species and 63% of the time they spent feeding on a year-round basis. I compare the feeding ecology and diet of L. 1. canain the Urucu and other taxa of Lagothrixin upper Amazonia \xe2\x80\x94 the last large-bodied Neotropical primates to be studied \xe2\x80\x94 to those of other ateline genera: Atelesand Brachyteles.'

Abstract: ' We report the diet of a wild troop of woolly monkeys (Lagothricha lagothricha lagothricha)in undisturbed rain forest in the lower Apaporis River region of southeastern Colombia during 2400 hr of observation from January 1985 through September 1987. The woolly monkey diet consisted of 78.9% fleshy fruits, 4.3% seeds, 11.4% leaves, 4.9% invertebrates, 0.1% flowers, 0.1% tendrils, and 0.3% bark. Fleshy, endozoochorus fruits were by far the most important type of food for the subjects. Intensive sampling of food plants used by L. 1. lagothrichashows floristically diverse diet including 185 species in 41 families, the most frequently used and species-rich of which are the Sapotaceae,the Moraceae, and the Mimosaceae. We compare our findings with other recent data on the three other subspecies of Lagothrixand discuss some of the ecological influences that might account for the macrogeographic similarities and differences observed in woolly monkey diets. Together, these studies provide the empirical basis for an unambiguous conclusion: Lagothrix lagothricha,classified by the IUCN as vulnerable, is a significant seed disperser throughout its extensive range. Accordingly, extinction of a population of Lagothrix isa major perturbation in its ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Records of sympatry between Alouatta caraya and A. clamitans are rare despite their extensive range overlap. An example of their current sympatry and the rediscovery of free-ranging potential hybrids of A. caraya and A. clamitans in the forests of the Upper Paran\xc3\xa1 River, Southern Brazil, are reported in this paper. Eight groups were observed in the study area: five monospecific groups of A. caraya, two of A. clamitans, and a group containing two adult males and two adult females of A. caraya and a sub-adult male and two adult females identified as Alouatta sp. The color of the last three individuals was a mosaic between the two species; this is consistent with previously described variations in museum specimens collected in the Paran\xc3\xa1 River in the 1940s that had been identified as potential hybrids. The results from this study emphasize the need for scientific studies in the region of the Ilha Grande National Park, one of the few regions in the Paran\xc3\xa1 River that currently harbors both howler species.'

Abstract: 'Tree species diversity and population structure at different community types were described and analyzed for primary and secondary lowland moist deciduous forests in Tripura. Overall 10,957 individual trees belonging to 46 family, 103 genera and 144 species were counted at \xe2\x89\xa530 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) using 28 permanent belt transects with a size of 1 ha (10 m \xc3\x97 1000 m). Four different tree communities were identified. The primary forests was dominated by Shorea robusta (mean density 464.77 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 105 species) and Schima wallichii (336.25 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 82 species), while the secondary forests was dominated by Tectona grandis (333.88 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 105 species) and Hevea brasiliensis (299.67 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 82 species). Overall mean basal area in this study was 18.01m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921; the maximum value was recorded in primary Shorea forest (26.21 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921). Mean density and diversity indices were differed significantly within four different communities. No significant differences were observed in number of species, genera, family and tree basal cover area. Significant relationships were found between the species richness and different tree population groups across the communities. Results revealed that species diversity and density were increased in those forests due to past disturbances which resulted in slow accumulation of native oligarchic small tree species. Seventeen species were recorded with <2 individuals of which Saraca asoka (Roxb.) de Wilde and Entada phaseoloides (L.) Merr. etc. extensively used in local ethno-medicinal formulations. The present S. robusta Gaertn dominated forest was recorded richer (105 species) than other reported studies. Moraceae was found more speciose family instead of Papilionaceae and Euphorbiaceae than other Indian moist deciduous forests. Seasonal phenological gap in such moist deciduous forests influenced the population of Trachypithecus pileatus and capped langur. The analysis of FIV suggested a slow trend of shifting the population of Lamiaceae group by Moraceae species in secondary T. grandis L. dominated community.'

Abstract: 'Little is known about the role ecological shifts play in the evolution of Neotropical radiations that have colonized a variety of environments. We here examine habitat shifts in the evolutionary history of Elaenia flycatchers, a Neotropical bird lineage that lives in a range of forest and open habitats. We evaluate phylogenetic relationships within the genus based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data, and then employ parsimony-based and Bayesian methods to reconstruct preferences for a number of habitat types and migratory behaviour throughout the evolutionary history of the genus. Using a molecular clock approach, we date the most important habitat shifts.'

Abstract: 'C4 plants are directly affected by all major global change parameters, often in a manner that is distinct from that of C3 plants. Rising CO2 generally stimulates C3 photosynthesis more than C4, but C4 species still exhibit positive responses, particularly at elevated temperature and arid conditions where they are currently common. Acclimation of photosynthesis to high CO2 occurs in both C3 and C4 plants, most notably in nutrient-limited situations. High CO2 aggravates nitrogen limitations and in doing so may favor C4 species, which have greater photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. C4 photosynthesis is favored by high temperature, but global warming will not necessarily favor C4 over C3 plants because the timing of warming could be more critical than the warming itself. C3 species will likely be favored where harsh winter climates are moderated, particularly where hot summers also become drier and less favorable to C4 plant growth. Eutrophication of soils by nitrogen deposition generally favors C3 species by offsetting the superior nitrogen use efficiency of C4 species; this should allow C3 species to expand at the expense of C4 plants. Land-use change and biotic invasions are also important global change factors that affect the future of C4 plants. Human exploitation of forested landscapes favors C4 species at low latitude by removing woody competitors and opening gaps in which C4 grasses can establish. Invasive C4 grasses are causing widespread forest loss in Asia, the Americas and Oceania by accelerating fire cycles and reducing soil nutrient status. Once established, weedy C4 grasses can prevent woodland establishment, and thus arrest ecological succession. In sum, in the future, certain C4 plants will prosper at the expense of C3 species, and should be able to adjust to the changes the future brings.'

Abstract: 'Recent studies have shown that small mountainous rivers (SMRs) may act as sources of aged and/or refractory carbon (C) to the coastal ocean, which may increase organic C burial at sea and subsidize coastal food webs and heterotrophy. However, the characteristics and spatial and temporal variability of C and organic matter (OM) exported from tropical SMR systems remain poorly constrained. To address this, the abundance and isotopic character (\xce\xb413C and \xce\x9414C) of the three major C pools were measured in two Puerto Rico SMRs with catchments dominated by different land uses (agricultural vs. non-agricultural recovering forest). The abundance and character of C pools in associated estuaries and adjacent coastal waters were also examined. Riverine dissolved and particulate organic C (DOC and POC, respectively) concentrations were highly variable with respect to land use and sampling month, while dissolved inorganic C (DIC) was significantly higher at all times in the agricultural catchment. In both systems, riverine DOC and POC ranged from modern to highly aged (2,340\xc2\xa0years before present), while DIC was always modern. The agricultural river and irrigation canals contained very old DOC (1,184 and 2,340\xc2\xa0years before present, respectively), which is consistent with findings in temperate SMRs and indicates that these tropical SMRs provide a source of aged DOC to the ocean. During months of high river discharge, OM in estuarine and coastal waters had C isotope signatures reflective of direct terrestrial input, indicating that relatively unaltered OM is transported to the coastal ocean at these times. This is also consistent with findings in temperate SMRs and indicates that C transported to the coastal ocean by SMRs may differ from that of larger rivers because it is exported from smaller catchments that have steeper terrains and fewer land-use types.'

Abstract: 'Global gridded precipitation is an essential driving input for hydrologic models to simulate runoff dynamics in large river basins. However, the data often fail to adequately represent precipitation variability in mountainous regions due to orographic effects and sparse and highly uncertain gauge data. Water balance simulations in tropical montane regions covered by cloud forests are especially challenging because of the additional water input from cloud water interception. The ISI-MIP2 hydrologic model ensemble encountered these problems for Andean sub-basins of the Upper Amazon Basin, where all models significantly underestimated observed runoff. In this paper, we propose simple yet plausible ways to adjust global precipitation data provided by WFDEI, the WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis, for tropical montane watersheds. The modifications were based on plausible reasoning and freely available tropics-wide data: (i) a high-resolution climatology of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and (ii) the percentage of tropical montane cloud forest cover. Using the modified precipitation data, runoff predictions significantly improved for all hydrologic models considered. The precipitation adjustment methods presented here have the potential to enhance other global precipitation products for hydrologic model applications in the Upper Amazon Basin as well as in other tropical montane watersheds.'

Abstract: 'A study was conducted at three sampling regions along the Rio Negro and surrounding Puraquequara Lake, Amazonas, Brazil. The aim was to determine the influence of the local effects of climatic and hydrological variables on new malaria cases. Data was gathered on the river level, precipitation, air temperature, and the number of new cases of autochthonous malaria between January 2003 and December 2013. Monthly averages, time series decompositions, cross-correlations, and multiple regressions revealed different relationships at each location. The sampling region in the upper Rio Negro indicated no statistically significant results. However, monthly averages suggest that precipitation and air temperature correlate positively with the occurrence of new cases of malaria. In the mid Rio Negro and Puraquequara Lake, the river level positively correlated, and temperature negatively correlated with new transmissions, while precipitation correlated negatively in the mid Rio Negro and positively on the lake. Overall, the river level is a key variable affecting the formation of breeding sites, while precipitation may either develop or damage them. A negative temperature correlation is associated with the occurrence of new annual post-peak cases of malaria, when the monthly average exceeds 28.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. This suggests that several factors contribute to the occurrence of new malaria cases as higher temperatures are reached at the same time as precipitation and the river levels are lowest. Differences between signals and correlation lags indicate that local characteristics have an impact on how different variables influence the disease vector\xe2\x80\x99s life cycle, pathogens, and consequently, new cases of malaria.'

Abstract: 'Agricultural expansion is a major driver of biodiversity loss, especially in the megadiverse tropics. Rice is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s most important food crops, invariably affecting biodiversity worldwide. Although the effects of habitat conversion to rice crops on biodiversity are not completely understood, landscape modification often creates conditions that benefit some species and excludes others. We conducted an integrative evaluation of the effects that habitat conversion to irrigated rice crops has on anuran communities from a Cerrado-Amazon ecotone. We adopted a multidimensional approach to compare anuran communities from agricultural and pristine environments considering (i) taxonomic metrics; (ii) functional and phylogenetic diversity; (iii) selected and excluded traits and (iv) body condition indices. When compared to their pristine counterparts, agricultural waterbodies showed increased functional divergence and decreased species diversity and functional richness. Furthermore, agricultural anuran communities exhibited lower phylogenetic diversity. Nonetheless, taxonomic diversity did not vary significantly, suggesting that it should not be used without complementary metrics. Species with small range, habitat specialization, small clutches and large body size were excluded from rice crops. Furthermore, frogs showed lower body condition in crops than in pristine areas. Understanding how species traits correlate with specific responses to agriculture will allow better predictions of the functional effects of anthropogenic land-use. Maintaining high diversity in anthropogenic environments is important for ecosystem resilience because diverse communities are more likely to hold multiple species capable of contributing to ecological functions. Our results show that converting natural vegetation to irrigated rice crops drives many species to local extinction, and resilient species to exhibit lower body condition.'

Abstract: 'A new coccidian species of the genus Isospora Schneider 1881 (Apicomplexa, Eimeriidae) is reported from a single specimen of chelid turtle, Platemys platycephala (Schneider, 1792), obtained in a flooded area of the Amazonian municipality of Altamira, in Par\xc3\xa1 State, northern Brazil.

Abstract: 'By 2014 approximately 2.2 million km2 (~43%) of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Legal Amazonia region had been incorporated into an extensive network of 718 protected areas, which are comprised by 372 indigenous lands, 313 federal, state and municipal (county) conservation units, and 33 Maroon territories (Quilombos). Although protected areas occupy vast expanses in Amazonia, their importance as carbon reserves needs to be better understood. In this study, we estimate the total carbon in 2014 held in protected areas in Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLegal Amazonia\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAmazonia biome\xe2\x80\x9d regions, and the carbon loss in the portions of these protected areas that were cleared by 2014. In 2014, a total of 33.4\xc2\xa0Pg\xc2\xa0C or 57.0% of all carbon stored in Legal Amazonia was held in protected areas and 32.7\xc2\xa0Pg\xc2\xa0C or 58.5% of all the carbon stored in the Amazonia biome was held in protected areas. By 2014, carbon lost due to clearing in protected areas in Legal Amazonia and the Amazonia biome totaled, respectively, 0.787 (or 2.3%) and 0.702 (or 2.1%) Pg\xc2\xa0C if one assumes that previously each protected area was entirely covered by native vegetation. If the protection of these areas is effective, about half of the carbon in Brazilian Amazonia will be maintained. Carbon in protected areas has strategic value for environmental conservation and for mitigation of climate change because these areas are under lower risk of being emitted to the atmosphere than carbon stored in vegetation located outside of protected areas, although the effectiveness of protected areas varies.'

Abstract: 'Estimation of global atmospheric emissions from biomass burning has used a variety of procedures, most of which involve chain multiplication. The terms in the chain of inference are often poorly quantified, and in many cases there is reason to suspect bias and intercorrelation between terms. The leading estimates appear to have been conservative; however, uncertainty explodes when imprecisely known (coefficient of variation >0.3) terms are multiplied. Thus little confidence can be had in the precision of current best estimates. The situation can be improved through a combination of spatial disaggregation and process-oriented modeling.'

Abstract: 'Candoshi sharply defined crop zonation and other farming practices are examined and compared with neighboring dissimilar Cocamilla practices and patterns. The comparison indicates that the Candoshi swiddens are probably more typical of aboriginal swiddens in the region than are the Cocamilla swiddens. Candoshi gardens may better be understood as a sophisticated response to microenvironmental conditions, specific plant needs, and equatorial rainfall patterns than as replicas of the tropical forest.'

Abstract: 'The relative abundance of an ungulate community in hunted and non-hunted areas was studied in Calakmul, a tropical forest in southern Mexico that includes a 723,815 ha Biosphere Reserve where no hunting is allowed and communal lands where hunting activity does take place. Tapir, white-lipped peccary (WLP), collared peccary, two species of brocket deer and white-tailed deer were the focal species. Relative abundance of ungulates was obtained by counting tracks along transects in three hunted sites and in the southern core area of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, a enforced part of the protected area of 350,000 ha where no hunting has been-permitted since 1989. A total of 1708 ungulates tracks were obtained along 206.1 km (n = 90 transects) divided among the four sites. Relative abundance of the species was estimated from the track encounter rate (TER) calculated as the number of tracks per species encountered per km of transect. No significant differences in brocket deer and collared peccary TER was found among hunted and non-hunted areas. TER for WLP was significant higher in the non-hunted area, while TER for white-tailed deer and tapir was significant higher in hunted sites. Hunting activity affected the ungulate species in Calakmul differently. Brocket deer, white-tailed deer and collared peccary are more resistant species toward the hunting pressure than the WLP, who needs an immediate protection plan throughout Calakmul. Hunting areas are important habitat refuges for tapir populations and they should be protected in these areas.'

Abstract: 'Participatory research documented the hunting yields of 59 households in five neighboring indigenous villages in western Panama. These households captured 2,580 kg of game over 8 months, with 47% of the harvest coming from agricultural areas. The quantity of game captured in anthropogenic habitats is influenced by the hunting strategies employed. Only 25% of game captured during hunting trips was captured in agricultural areas, as opposed to 93% while \xe2\x80\x9cawaiting\xe2\x80\x9d and 65% using traps. Reliance on different strategies is in turn dependent on age, gender, and access to firearms. I argue that garden hunting is not a response to game depletion, but rather a productive activity that is complementary to broader cultural and economic patterns, and that simultaneously protects crops from animal predation. The creation of heterogeneous habitat mosaics through shifting cultivation has played a key role in the relationship between people and wildlife in the humid neotropics, leading to adjustments in both animal foraging patterns and indigenous hunting practices.'

Abstract: 'The relationship between biodiversity and the activities of small-scale farmers remains poorly understood despite its importance for conservation. In tropical forest areas farmers often include extraction of forest products in their subsistence strategies, and it has been suggested that factors such as market access and diversity levels influence people\xe2\x80\x99s use of forest products. To investigate these relationships, we studied the use of palms in five villages inhabited by colonists and indigenous Shuar in the lower montane forest in south-eastern Ecuador by means of interviews and line transects around the villages. We found that use of palms was not driven by the diversity of palms available in the forest surrounding each village. Instead, the most important factor seemed to be lack of market access so in villages furthest away from the nearest road people used more palm products for their subsistence life compared to villages closer to the road. Forests around more remote villages had higher utility levels when evaluated on the basis of the villagers\xe2\x80\x99 use of palms, despite lower levels of palm diversity and richness in these forests. The lower diversity levels may reflect past human activity or ecological factors, or a combination of both. In either case, our results show that forests with higher diversity levels are not necessarily more valuable to local people compared to less diverse forests. Instead, socio-economic factors such as market access may be more important in shaping people\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the natural environment.'

Abstract: 'As assessed by the IUCN Mace\xe2\x80\x93Lande system, seven (35%) of the 20 Alouatta species and subspecies with adequate data are classified as \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable (Rylands et al., 1995). This percentage is much lower than the 75 to 100% threatened taxa for the other large-bodied genera: Ateles, Lagothrix, and Brachyteles. Only 5 of the 16 Neotropical genera have lower percentages of threatened taxa than that of Alouatta: Cebuella, Pithecia, Saguinus, Saimiri, and Cebus. The threatened howler taxa occupy small distributions in areas of forest fragmentation. In general, populations are most affected by major habitat disturbance, such as total deforestation and flooding from dam construction, and by human hunters. Facilitated by their ability to exploit folivorous diets in small home ranges, howlers can tolerate considerable habitat fragmentation but not the increased exposure to hunting that may accompany it. Howlers seem particularly vulnerable to yellow fever and bot fly parasitism. Although the former threat may decrease by increasing fragmentation of the habitat, other sorts of parasitism may increase in disturbed habitats. The low genetic variability of the Central American howlers suggests a resistance to inbreeding depression potentially experienced during population bottlenecks. Greater between-population variability may still exist. Although howlers are not readily bred in captivity, they respond well to translocation. Translocation has been successfully achieved for \xe2\x89\xa54 howler species and is a viable option for introducing new genetic variability into population fragments and repopulating areas from which howlers are extinct. Their pattern of bisexual dispersal facilitates colonization of regenerating habitats, and in suitable, protected habitats they have shown the capacity for strong population recovery.'

Abstract: 'This paper describes global changes in forest cover from 1982 to 1999 based on the 8-km Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data set. The procedure involves the use of a regression tree in predicting percent tree cover for the years 1982\xe2\x80\x9399. Training data are created from high-resolution imagery and used with phenological metrics derived from the annual AVHRR time series. Using the 18\xc2\xa0years of estimated tree cover, and based on a thresholding approach, we identified locations where change in tree cover has occurred. The change sites were then compared to a set of high-resolution deforestation analyses to yield area estimates of deforestation and regrowth. Percent tree cover was found to have decreased globally, from the 1980s to 1990s, in contrast to United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports of a global increase in forest cover. Latin America and tropical Asia are the two dominant deforestation regions. Paraguay shows the highest rate of forest clearing over the time series, while Indonesia had the greatest increase in deforestation from the 1980s to 1990s. We also suggest that the percent tree-cover maps can be used in standardizing national forest statistics, as an objective means of identifying hot spots of change, and for facilitating ecosystem monitoring.'

Abstract: 'The tropical forests of the Americas contain great biological diversity yet they are being rapidly destroyed by population pressure, injudicious logging, and inappropriate government policies. In this article we explain how the extraction of rattan-like lianas could represent a sustainable system of forest management in which smallholder incomes are increased while relieving deforestation pressures.'

Abstract: 'The aromobatid frog Allobates amissibilis sp. nov. is described from a very limited area in the Iwokrama Mountains at elevations between 160 and 950\xc2\xa0m, in central Guyana, South America. The new taxon is diagnosed from other Allobates species by morphology, bioacoustics, and genetics, and can be distinguished readily from known congeners by cryptic colouration, small size (16.3\xe2\x80\x9317.8\xc2\xa0mm snout-vent length), absence of distinct dorsal pattern in living adult individuals, presence of a distinctly enlarged tubercle on each eyelid, diffuse broad oblique lateral stripe extending from groin to about midbody length, sexually dimorphic throat colouration (pinkish grey, suffused with dark pigment in male, immaculate cream to yellow in female), belly cream to yellow in both sexes, and distinct vocalisation formed by calls of usually 9\xe2\x80\x9312 notes emitted between silent intervals of usually ca. 2\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xa0s, with a dominant frequency ranging from 5,064 to 5,845\xc2\xa0Hz. The new species is the third microendemic reported from the Iwokrama Mountains together with the caecilian Caecilita iwokramae and the lizard Gonatodes timidus. We recommend considering the conservation status of the new species as Data Deficient, and highlight that environmental impact assessments are needed to refine its IUCN threat status.'

Abstract: 'Hydroelectric dams in tropical forest areas emit greenhouse gases, as illustrated by the Curu\xc3\xa1-Una Dam in the Amazonian portion of Brazil. Emissions include carbon dioxide from decay of the above-water portions of trees that are left standing in the reservoir and methane from soft vegetation that decays under anaerobic conditions on the bottom of the reservoir, especially macrophytes (water weeds) and vegetation that grows in the drawdown zone and is flooded when the reservoir water level rises. Some methane is released from the reservoir surface through bubbling and diffusion, but larger amounts are released from water passing through the turbines and spillway. Methane concentration in the water increases with depth, and the turbines and spillway draw water from sufficient depth to have substantial methane content. In 1990 (13 years after filling), the Curu\xc3\xa1-Una Dam emitted 3.6 times more greenhouse gases than would have been emitted by generating the same amount of electricity from oil.'

Abstract: ' Understanding how large-scale bioenergy production can affect biodiversity and ecosystems is important if society is to meet current and future sustainable development goals. A variety of bioenergy production systems have been established within different contexts throughout the Pan American region, with wide-ranging results in terms of documented and projected effects on biodiversity and ecosystems. The Pan American region is home to the majority of commercial bioenergy production and therefore the region offers a broad set of experiences and insights on both conflicts and opportunities for biodiversity and bioenergy. This paper synthesizes lessons learned focusing on experiences in Canada, the United States, and Brazil regarding the conflicts that can arise between bioenergy production and ecological conservation, and benefits that can be derived when bioenergy policies promote planning and more sustainable land-management systems. We propose a research agenda to address priority information gaps that are relevant to biodiversity concerns and related policy challenges in the Pan American region.'

Abstract: 'Process-based models are important tools for understanding the dynamics and functioning of forest ecosystems. In nearly all models, forest productivity is largely driven by carbon (C) input via photosynthesis, which reacts strongly positive to elevated CO2 (eCO2). The simulated increases in forest productivity in terms of wood production, however, have been much higher than experimental and observational evidence suggests, at least in those models that did not account for nutrient limitations. Experimental results show that in most investigated systems, eCO2 leads to increasing allocation of C below ground, without sustained enhancements of wood production. This translocation of C below ground, which also enhances nutrient uptake, appears to be larger than simulated in our current models. However, because of a lack of experimental data from real ecosystems, in particular from the tropics, the big question remains unresolved whether increasing levels of CO2 have and will lead to substantially increased forest productivity in terms of stand-level wood increment. To reduce the uncertainties, it will be necessary to develop new theory, implement that in models, and rigorously compare model results with observations. They range from physiological measurements, results from \xe2\x80\x9cfree air CO2 enrichment\xe2\x80\x9d experiments to forest inventories, tree rings and 13C analyses\xc2\xa0(as a proxy for changes in water use efficiency). Key issues that should be addressed in the models include the coupling of C and nutrient cycles, limitations to the C sink capacity of trees, dynamic changes in allocation, and potential feedbacks from tree population dynamics on stand productivity.'

Abstract: 'Among species, photosynthetic capacity (Amax) is usually related to leaf nitrogen content (N), but variation in the species-specific relationship is not well understood. To address this issue, we studied Amax-N relationships in 23 species in adjacent Amazonian communities differentially limited by nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and/or other mineral nutrients. Five species were studied in each of three late successional forest types (Tierra Firme, Caatinga and Bana) and eight species were studied on disturbed sites (cultivated and early secondary successional Tierra Firme plots). Amax expressed on a mass basis (Amass) was correlated (p<0.05) with Nmass in 17 of 23 species, and Amax on an area basis (Aarea) was correlated (p<0.05) with Narea in 21 of 23 species. The slopes of Amax-N relationships were greater and intercepts lower for disturbance adapted early successional species than for late successional species. On a mass basis, the Amax-N slope averaged \xe2\x89\x8815 \xce\xbcmol CO2 [g N]-1 s-1 for 7 early secondary successional species and \xe2\x89\x884 \xce\xbcmol CO2 [g N]-1 s-1 for 15 late successional species, respectively. Species from disturbed sites had shorter leaf life-span and greater specific leaf area (SLA) than late successional species. Across all 23 species, the slope of the Amass-Nmass relationship was related (p<0.001) positively to SLA (r2=0.70) and negatively to leaf life-span (r2=0.78) and temporal niche during secondary succession (years since cutting-and-burning, r2=0.90). Thus, disturbance adapted early successional species display a set of traits (short leaf life-span, high SLA and Amax and a steep slope of Amax-N) conducive to resource acquisition and rapid growth in their high resource regeneration niches. The significance and form of the Amax-N relationship were associated with the relative nutrient limitations in the three late successional communities. At species and community levels, Amax was more highly dependent on N in the N-limited Caatinga than in the P-and N-limited Bana and least in the P-and Ca-limited Tierra Firme on oxisol-and differences among these three communities in their massbased Amax-N slope reflects this pattern (6.0, 2.4, and 0.7 \xce\xbcmol CO2 [g N]-1 s-1, respectively). Among all 23 species, the estimated leaf Nmass needed to reach compensation (net photosynthesis \xe2\x89\x88 zero) was positively related to the Amass-Nmass slope and to dark respiration rates and negatively related to leaf life-span. Variation among species in the Amax-N slope was well correlated with potential photosynthetic N use efficiency, Amax per unit leaf N. The dependence of Amax on N and the form of the relationship vary among Amazonian species and communities, consistent with both relative availabilities of N, P, and other mineral nutrients, and with intrinsic ecophysiological characteristics of species adapted to habitats of varying resource availability.'

Abstract: 'Climate change is expected to impact the hydrological regime worldwide, and land use and land cover change may alter the effects of the former in some cases. Secondary growth in deforested and abandoned areas is one of the main consequences of land use and cover changes in Amazonia. Among land uses, the effects of the secondary growth in water availability in large scale basins are not well understood. This work analyzes the potential effects of secondary growth under climate and land use change on water availability and hydropower in the Tocantins basin, in the Legal Amazon region of Brazil, using the MHD-INPE hydrological model driven by different climate scenarios and two future socioeconomic-based potential land use scenarios. The model projects decrease on discharge under climate change scenarios, which further cause the simulated hydropower energy potential to decrease significantly. When only deforestation scenarios are included, the effects of climate change are weakened, but when secondary growth is also considered, the effects of climate change are enhanced. Results suggest that different aspects of environmental change, such as secondary growth, may affect water production and the sectors depending on it.'

Abstract: 'The challenge of controlling and eventually eradicating malaria means that new tools are urgently needed. South America\xe2\x80\x99s role in this fight spans both ends of the research and development spectrum: both as a continent capable of discovering and developing new medicines, and also as a continent with significant numbers of malaria patients. This article reviews the contribution of groups in the South American continent to the research and development of new medicines over the last decade. Therefore, the current situation of research targeting malaria control and eradication is discussed, including endemicity, geographical distribution, treatment, drug-resistance and diagnosis. This sets the scene for a review of efforts within South America to discover and optimize compounds with anti-malarial activity.'

Abstract: 'Drought- and heat-driven tree mortality, along with associated insect outbreaks, have been observed globally in recent decades and are expected to increase in future climates. Despite its potential to profoundly alter ecosystem carbon and water cycles, how tree mortality scales up to ecosystem functions and fluxes is uncertain. We describe a framework for this scaling where the effects of mortality are a function of the mortality attributes, such as spatial clustering and functional role of the trees killed, and ecosystem properties, such as productivity and diversity. We draw upon remote-sensing data and ecosystem flux data to illustrate this framework and place climate-driven tree mortality in the context of other major disturbances. We find that emerging evidence suggests that climate-driven tree mortality impacts may be relatively small and recovery times are remarkably fast (~4\xc2\xa0years for net ecosystem production). We review the key processes in ecosystem models necessary to simulate the effects of mortality on ecosystem fluxes and highlight key research gaps in modeling. Overall, our results highlight the key axes of variation needed for better monitoring and modeling of the impacts of tree mortality and provide a foundation for including climate-driven tree mortality in a disturbance framework.'

Abstract: 'Approaches towards the management of artisanal fisheries have been enlightening the scientific literature for approximately the last 20\xc2\xa0years. Coming from diverse disciplines such as anthropology, biology, economy, and ecology (especially human ecology), these approaches have dealt with common theory, strategies for cooperation, decision-making models, cultural contexts, and local knowledge. Fishery management depends on an understanding of the interactions between humans and aquatic resources, and in case of indigenous or of native populations, forestry resources are also considered for livelihoods. Acquiring an understanding of the local knowledge about fish and other resources, of collective local arrangements and institutions, of market interactions, and of the decision-making processes of fishers is fundamental for the management of artisanal fisheries. This review includes historical and current approaches associated with the management of artisanal fisheries. These approaches include the following: (a) cultural and human ecological approaches, including ecological models such as optimal foraging theory; (b) institutional approaches, including processes of cooperation associated with local knowledge and institutions; and (c) current ecological-economic propositions towards fishery management, such as payments for environmental services. This revision is illustrated through examples, in particular, of data collected among coastal artisanal fisheries of the SE Atlantic Forest in Brazil.'

Abstract: 'The impact of forest clearance, and its replacement by Brachiaria pastures, on soil carbon reserves has been studied at many sites in the Brazilian Amazonia, but to date there appear to be no reports of similar studies undertaken in the Atlantic forest region of Brazil. In this study performed in the extreme south of Bahia, the changes in C and N content of the soil were evaluated from the time of establishment of grass-only B. humidicola and mixed B. humidicola/Desmodium ovalifolium pastures through 9 years of grazing in comparison with the C and N contents of the adjacent secondary forest. The decline in the content of soil C derived from the forest (C3) vegetation and the accumulation of that derived from the Brachiaria (C4) were followed by determining the 13C natural abundance of the soil organic matter (SOM). The pastures were established in 1987, 10 years after deforestation, and it was estimated that until 1994 there was a loss in forest-derived C in the top 30 cm of soil of approximately 20% (9.1 Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921). After the establishment of the pastures, C derived from Brachiaria accumulated steadily such that at the final sampling (1997) it was estimated 13.9 Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921 was derived from this source under the grass-only pasture (0\xe2\x80\x9330 cm). Samples taken from all pastures and the forest in 1997 to a depth of 100 cm showed that below 40 cm depth there was no significant contribution of the Brachiaria-derived C and that total C reserves under the grass/legume and the grass-only pastures were slightly higher than under the forest (not significant at P=0.05). The more detailed sampling under the pastures showed that to a depth of 30 cm there was significantly (P<0.05) more C under the mixed pasture than the grass-only pasture. It was estimated that from the time of establishment the apparent rate of C accumulation (0\xe2\x80\x93100 cm depth) under the grass/legume pastures (1.17 Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921 yr\xe2\x88\x921) was almost double that under the grass-only pastures (0.66 Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921 yr\xe2\x88\x921). The data indicated that newly incorporated SOM derived from the Brachiaria had a considerably higher C:N ratio than that present under the forest.'

Abstract: 'Management of wetlands is often constrained by lack of a precise typology of habitats. Regional landscape attributes need to be considered in the integrative research of wetlands to allow habitat-specific management. Here we investigated the distribution and the habitat diversity of the wetlands in the Amazonian Piedmont in the Caquet\xc3\xa1 Department of Colombia. Based on the landscape approach we combined geomorphic, hydro-chemical and biotic attributes. We used remote sensing based interpretation and ground truth verification. We found 896 wetlands covering up to 11\xc2\xa0% of the study area. Our estimate of the wetland area does not reflect the true historic wetland area (occasionally flooded area) because 76.9\xc2\xa0% of the flooded active floodplain area has been converted to pastures. Including the pastures the estimated wetland area is 29.3\xc2\xa0% of the study region. We identified 7 wetland habitats. The method we applied can be used to map small and middle sized wetlands achieving an acceptable overall accuracy. These wetlands provide important ecosystem services and act as corridors for biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes such as the Caquet\xc3\xa1 region. Our results provide support for the wise use of tropical wetlands and may help to improve landscape management in the Amazon basin.'

Abstract: 'Utilization of germplasm for crop improvement is often hampered by absence of information regarding origin, genetic identity and genealogical relationships of germplasm groups or populations. Molecular marker technology offers an efficient tool to verify or reconstruct passport data. Using a high-throughput genotyping system with 15 microsatellite loci, we fingerprinted 482 accessions in 48 putative half-sib families of Refractario cacao (a group of germplasm collected from nine farms in Ecuador). Based on the multilocus profiles, a Bayesian method for individual assignment was applied to verify membership in each half-sib family. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that the Refractario genetic profile was different from other groups tested, except for the \xe2\x80\x9cNacional\xe2\x80\x9d cacao from the coastal valley of Ecuador. Hierarchical partitioning of genetic variance in the Refractario cacao showed that 76% of the variation was contributed by intra-family difference, whereas the inter-family and inter-farm difference accounted for 15 and 9% of total variance, respectively. All three sources of variation were highly significant (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01). Cluster and Principal Coordinates Analyses revealed a population sub-structure in Refractario, which was also highly heterozygous, suggesting hybridization derived from Nacional cacao and multiple other parental varieties, which all shared a similar genetic background. The improved understanding of identities and structure in Refractario cacao will contribute to more efficient conservation and use of this germplasm group in cacao breeding.'

Abstract: "We measured CO2, CO, CH4, H2, and NO2 in air masses polluted by savanna fires over C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire, western Africa. Elevated concentrations of these trace gases were found in fire plumes and also in extensive haze layers. Trace gas mixing ratios ranged as high as 605 ppmv for CO2, 14.8 ppmv for CO, 2.7 ppmv for CH4, 4.2 ppmv for H2, and 25 ppbv for NO2. We compare our emission ratios to those obtained in previous field and laboratory studies. The emission ratios, expressed as an average and as a range or as an average only, were: dCO/dCO2 5.3\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x922 (3\xe2\x88\x9218\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x922); dCH4/dCO 5.3\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x922; dH2/dCO 2.4\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x921 and dNO2/dCO2 1.8\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x924 (1.5\xe2\x88\x922.2\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x924). The values found match those found during similar measurements, though our results point to rather vigorous burning in the savanna of western Africa."

Abstract: 'Cocoa originates from the beans of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao L.). It is an important commodity and the main ingredient in chocolate manufacture. Its value and quality are related to complex flavors and to its distinct sensory properties. The increasing demand for cocoa and its rising price urges the research for cocoa substitutes. A potential substitute for cocoa is carob. Carob is the fruit of an evergreen tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.) cultivated in the Mediterranean area, well known for its valuable locust bean gum and also for carob powder and syrup that are obtained from carob pulp. Cocoa beans and carob pods contain various phytochemicals including polyphenols, proteins and amino acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates and fiber. Phytochemicals represent an important source of nutrients and compounds that are beneficial to human health. In this review, phytochemicals in cocoa beans and carob pods and their impact on human health are reviewed. The bioactive compounds that are present in carob, in conjunction with the cocoa-like flavors and unique sensory properties that are enhanced by carob powder roasting, underline carob\xe2\x80\x99s potential to substitute cocoa in various food products. These food applications are discussed in this review.'

Abstract: 'The project of indigenous agricultural development is now widely perceived as valid, given the technological limitations of and the social problems exacerbated by the Green Revolution. Different authors have presented critiques of the Green Revolution based upon their studies of indigenous agricultural practices and their attendant knowledge systems. Such analyses provide important foundations for the promotion of indigenous agricultural development, but do not adequately address the socio-historical dimension. In Latin America, promoting such development must rely upon the reassessment of indigenous culture and ethnic survival by the scientific community.'

Abstract: 'There is much evidence to support past contact between the Atlantic and the Amazon forests through the South American dry vegetation diagonal, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of this contact still need to be investigated to allow a better understanding of its biogeographic implications for birds. Here, we combined phylogenetic data with distributional data using a supermatrix approach in order to depict the historical connection dynamics between these biomes for New World suboscines. We examined the variation in divergence time and then compared the spatial distributions of taxon pairs representing old and recent divergences. Our results pointed to two distinct spatiotemporal pathways connecting the Atlantic and the Amazonian forests in the past: (1) old connections (middle to late Miocene) through the current southern Cerrado and Mato Grosso and the transition towards the Chaco and palm savannas of Bolivia and Paraguay; (2) young connections (Pliocene to Pleistocene) that possibly occurred through the Cerrado and Caatinga in northeastern Brazil. We suggest that the main events that played important roles in these connections were geotectonic events during the late Tertiary associated with the uplift of the Andes (old connections) and Quaternary climate changes that promoted the expansion of gallery forest through the Cerrado and Caatinga in northeastern Brazil (young connections). Our results provide the first general temporal and spatial model of how the Atlantic and Amazonian forests were connected in the past, which was derived using bird data.'

Abstract: 'In Brazil, malaria is endemic in the Amazon River basin and non-endemic in the extra-Amazon region, which includes areas of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo state. In this state, a number of autochthonous cases of malaria occur annually, and the prevalence of subclinical infection is unknown. Asymptomatic infections may remain undetected, maintaining transmission of the pathogen, including by blood transfusion. In these report it has been described subclinical Plasmodium infection in blood donors from a blood transfusion centre in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, Brazil.'

Abstract: 'In Colombia, the access to climate related observational data is restricted and their quantity is limited. But information about the current climate is fundamental for studies on present and future climate changes and their impacts. In this respect, this information is especially important over the Colombian Caribbean Catchment Basin (CCCB) that comprises over 80\xc2\xa0% of the population of Colombia and produces about 85\xc2\xa0% of its GDP. Consequently, an ensemble of several datasets has been evaluated and compared with respect to their capability to represent the climate over the CCCB. The comparison includes observations, reconstructed data (CPC, Delaware), reanalyses (ERA-40, NCEP/NCAR), and simulated data produced with the regional climate model REMO. The capabilities to represent the average annual state, the seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability are investigated. The analyses focus on surface air temperature and precipitation as well as on surface water and energy balances. On one hand the CCCB characteristics poses some difficulties to the datasets as the CCCB includes a mountainous region with three mountain ranges, where the dynamical core of models and model parameterizations can fail. On the other hand, it has the most dense network of stations, with the longest records, in the country. The results can be summarised as follows: all of the datasets demonstrate a cold bias in the average temperature of CCCB. However, the variability of the average temperature of CCCB is most poorly represented by the NCEP/NCAR dataset. The average precipitation in CCCB is overestimated by all datasets. For the ERA-40, NCEP/NCAR, and REMO datasets, the amplitude of the annual cycle is extremely high. The variability of the average precipitation in CCCB is better represented by the reconstructed data of CPC and Delaware, as well as by NCEP/NCAR. Regarding the capability to represent the spatial behaviour of CCCB, temperature is better represented by Delaware and REMO, while precipitation is better represented by Delaware. Among the three datasets that permit an analysis of surface water and energy balances (REMO, ERA-40, and NCEP/NCAR), REMO best demonstrates the closure property of the surface water balance within the basin, while NCEP/NCAR does not demonstrate this property well. The three datasets represent the energy balance fairly well, although some inconsistencies were found in the individual balance components for NCEP/NCAR.'

Abstract: 'We compare lizard assemblages of Cerrado and Amazonian savannas to test the ecological release hypothesis, which predicts that niche dimensions and abundance should be greater in species inhabiting isolated habitat patches with low species richness (Amazonian savannas and isolated Cerrado patches) when compared with nonisolated areas in central Cerrado with greater species richness. We calculated microhabitat and diet niche breadths with data from 14 isolated Cerrado patches and Amazon savanna areas and six central Cerrado populations. Morphological data were compared using average Euclidean distances, and lizard abundance was estimated using the number of lizards captured in pitfall traps over an extended time period. We found no evidence of ecological release with respect to microhabitat use, suggesting that historical factors are better microhabitat predictors than ecological factors. However, data from individual stomachs indicate that ecological release occurs in these areas for one species (Tropidurus) but not others (Ameiva ameiva, Anolis, Cnemidophorus, and Micrablepharus), suggesting that evolutionary lineages respond differently to environmental pressures, with tropidurids being more affected by ecological factors than polychrotids, teiids, and gymnophthalmids. We found no evidence that ecological release occurs in these areas using morphological data. Based on abundance data, our results indicate that the ecological release (density compensation) hypothesis is not supported: lizard species are not more abundant in isolated areas than in nonisolated areas. The ecology of species is highly conservative, varying little from assemblage to assemblage. Nevertheless, increases in niche breadth for some species indicate that ecological release occurs as well.'

Abstract: 'Anthropogenic disturbances, such as conversion of forests to pastures, are considered one of the major causes of Amazonian biodiversity loss. Pastures are hostile environments for forest species that are not adapted to the adverse conditions of open areas. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of forest replacement by cattle pastures in the north-eastern part of the Amazonian rainforest using dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) as indicators. Therefore, we determined edge effects and differences in dung beetle species richness, composition, and abundance between forest and neighbouring cattle pastures. A total of 6723 individuals of 63 species of dung beetle were collected. In comparison to forests, adjacent pastures were sharply less rich and abundant in dung beetles. The forests had 6604 individuals and 59 species, while the pastures had 119 individuals and 12 species. The replacement of forests by pastures results in an increase of dung beetle species turnover. Only 12% of dung beetle species were shared by both forest and pasture environments. We highlight that most Amazonian dung beetles are forest species sensitive to abrupt human-driven modification of habitats and are only moderately affected by edge effects.'

Abstract: "Gestational malaria is a multi-factorial syndrome leading to poor outcomes for both the mother and foetus. Although an unusual increasing in the number of hospitalizations caused by Plasmodium vivax has been reported in Brazil, mortality is rarely observed. This is a report of a gestational malaria case that occurred in the city of Manaus (Amazonas State, Brazil) and resulted in foetal loss. The patient presented placental mixed-infection by Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum after diagnosis by nested-PCR, however microscopic analysis failed to detect P. falciparum in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, as the patient did not receive proper treatment for P. falciparum and hospitalization occurred soon after drug treatment, it seems that P. falciparum pathology was modulated by the concurrent presence of P. vivax. Collectively, this case confirms the tropism towards the placenta by both of these species of parasites, reinforces the notion that co-existence of distinct malaria parasites interferes on diseases' outcomes, and opens discussions regarding diagnostic methods, malaria treatment during pregnancy and prenatal care for women living in unstable transmission areas of malaria, such as the Brazilian Amazon."

Abstract: 'The Tukanoans of northwestern Amazonia cultivate high-cyanogenic potential cassava, which provides 80% of their dietary energy. In an effort to understand why the Tukanoans cultivate primarily high-rather than low-cyanogenic potential cassava, which requires far less processing before consumption, this paper seeks to determine whether the Tukanoans discern a difference in levels of predation on high-and low-cyanogenic potential cassava. Given the potential protection afforded by high-cyanogenic potential, it was hypothesized that the Tukanoans would report higher predation upon low-cyanogenic potential cassava in comparison to high-cyanogenic potential cassava. Both unstructured interviews and pile-sort exercises were conducted to address this question. The unstructured interviews provide some support for the hypothesis, while the pile-sort interviews did not support the hypothesis. These data demonstrate that while the Tukanoans are cognizant of differences in predation on different cassava cultivars, resistance to predation may not be a characteristic of paramount concern in cultivar selection.'

Abstract: 'The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world and is home to a rich biodiversity of medicinal plants. Several of these plants are used by the local population for the treatment of diseases, many of those with probable anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant and anti-peroxidases potential of the ethanol extracts of five plants from the Brazilian Amazon (Byrsonima japurensis, Calycophyllum spruceanum, Maytenus guyanensis, Passiflora nitida and Ptychopetalum olacoides).'

Abstract: 'Dung beetles have widely been accepted as cost-effective indicator taxa for biodiversity assessment; thus, standard protocols have been created to examine their species richness and diversity in many habitats. However, the vast majority of studies adopt short-term sampling protocols; few studies have quantified sampling efficiency at longer time scales or tested the efficacy of species richness estimates. Here we present long- and short-term sampling data from two regions of French Guiana: the Nouragues Tropical Forest Research Station and Kaw Mountain. We examine species richness and diversity, and use these data to make suggestions for future biodiversity assessments of dung beetles using dung baited pitfall transects. Species richness estimates based on short-term samples strongly underestimate the actual species richness by approximately 40\xc2\xa0%. Duration of trapping was found to be more important than the number of traps and length of transects; by setting a second transect (4-day sample period) in the same habitat of Nouragues, thereby increasing the sample duration, the number of species increased by 14\xc2\xa0%.'

Abstract: 'Data on soil nutrient availability for humid tropical forests are often reported, but are rarely integrated in an ecologically meaningful way with other measures of nutrient cycling. In this paper, estimates of soil nutrient availability and the inverse of litterfall nutrient concentrations (as an index of plant nutrient use) were compared, using data from 36 sites throughout the humid tropics, to determine if relationships exist between commonly used indices of nutrient cycling for plants and soils. Measures of both extractable and total soil P were significantly and positively correlated with the ratio of litterfall mass/P, particularly for montane tropical forests. Extractable soil P was also significantly correlated with litterfall mass for lowland humid tropical forests, explaining 58% of the variability in litterfall mass. A weak, albeit significant correlation was found between exchangeable soil Ca and litterfall mass/Ca, even though soil extraction techniques vary greatly. No significant relationship was found for total soil N, the most commonly measured soil N pool, and the inverse of litterfall N concentrations. The results suggest that our indices of soil P are related to litterfall processes, but that other measures, particularly total soil N, may not be as relevant to nutrient cycling by the vegetation.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the characteristics of gaseous exchanges and chlorophyll a fluorescence under different irradiances in two liana species Canavalia parviflora Benth. (Fabaceae) and Gouania virgata Reissk (Rhamnaceae), both of a semi-deciduous tropical forest of Southeast Brazil. We used cultivated plants growing under irradiances of 100, 40, 10, and 1.5 % of the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Higher net photosynthetic rates (P N) were observed during early morning under full sunlight. After this, reduced P N values were recorded due to pronounced stomatal closure. In Canavalia, the gas exchange responses diminished concomitant with reduced irradiance. Gouania exhibited a narrower range of response, with high P N values even at 10 % PPFD. Marked reduction of the effective photochemical yield (\xce\x94F/Fm\xe2\x80\x99) near midday was observed, followed by increases in the non-photochemical quenching for both species under full sunlight. Despite the common occurrence of these species in open areas of the forest, both were able to maintain relatively high P N in shaded environments. We suggest that lianas present an intermediate physiological behaviour between shade and non-shade tolerant species.'

Abstract: 'We examined the mycobiota associated with Vismia guianensis leaf litter in three Atlantic Forest remnants of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s semiarid region. Among the study sites, two remnants were protected forest reserves, whereas the third was influenced by major anthropogenic activities. Eighteen litter samples were collected in wet and dry seasons and were processed by particle filtration technique. A total of 4750 fungal isolates of 142 taxa were identified. Species richness was higher in litter samples collected during wet season. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling multivariate analysis showed differences in the composition of fungal communities among the sampling sites and the seasons. Analysis of similarity showed that the differences were statistically significant (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.85; P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.0001). Our findings revealed that spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and human activities had significant impacts on the saprobic fungi of V. guianensis leaf litter.'

Abstract: 'Pithecia pithecia andChiropotes satanas are seed predators that eat fruits with hard pericarps. We measured resistance to puncturing and crushing of fruit and seeds eaten by these two pitheciins at two localities: in evergreen rain forest at Raleighvallen-Voltzberg, Surinam, and in tropical dry/transitional moist forest on islands in Guri Lake, Venezuela. Average measurements of pericarp hardness were similar at both sites for fruit eaten byChiropotes, but a higher maximum value was obtained at the rainforest site.Chiropotes andPithecia both ate fruits that had harder pericarps than did fruits eaten byAteles paniscus, but crushing resistances of seeds eaten were lower than values forAteles. Thus, both pitheciins selected fruits with hard pericarps and soft seeds, although there were notable intergeneric differences in hardness of fruit ingested. When fruit became scarce,Pithecia ate more flowers, whileChiropotes continued to eat fruits with hard seed coverings. Chemical analysis of species of seeds eaten byPithecia suggests that they avoided seeds with extremely high tannin levels, though they tolerated moderate tannin levels in combination with high levels of lipids. We propose that sclerocarpic harvesting (the preparation and ingestion of fruit with a hard pericarp) allows pitheciin monkeys to obtain nutritious seeds, with reduced tannins, that are softer than those ingested by other frugivores.'

Abstract: 'Nitrogen mineralization, nitrification potentials, pH, total N, C, extractable P and cations were measured in soils under 4-year-old, mono-specific stands of six fast-growing, native tree species, an abandoned pasture, and a 20-year-old secondary forest, as part of a study on the use of indigenous tree species for rehabilitation of soil fertility on degraded pastures at the La Selva Biological Station in the Atlantic humid lowlands of Costa Rica. Soil net nitrification potential rates were higher under two N-fixing, leguminous species,Stryphnodendron microstachyum Poepp. et Endl. (1.1\xe2\x80\x931.9 mg kg\xe2\x88\x921 day\xe2\x88\x921) andDalbergia tucurensis Donn. Smith (0.7\xe2\x80\x931.5 mg kg\xe2\x88\x921 day\xe2\x88\x921), than under the non-N-fixing trees in the plantation,Vochysia guatemalesis Don. Sm.,Vochysia ferruginea Mart,Dipteryx panamensis (Pittier) Record and Mell andHyeronima alchorneoides Fr. Allemao (0.2\xe2\x80\x930.8 mg kg\xe2\x88\x921 day\xe2\x88\x921). Values under the N-fixing trees were comparable to those found in secondary forest. There were no statistically significant differences in soil total N or in other nurtients between the species. Results of pH measurements done before and after incubation did not show any clear evidence of a pH drop attributable to nitrification.'

Abstract: 'The creation of the NYBG Institute of Economic Botany (IEB) was intended to help revitalize the field of economic botany and ethnobotany, through the work of a multidisciplinary staff who would study important issues of great human concern. Early staff appointments included anthropologists and ecologists, who utilized perspectives from the social and natural sciences that, when combined with NYBG staff trained in systematic botany, economic botany and ethnobotany, have been effective in changing research approaches to the study of the relationships between plants, people and culture. IEB staff activities include research projects, teaching in graduate and undergraduate programs, mentoring students, publishing the results of scientific research and outreach to the public as well as communities in areas where its programs operate. Thirty-five years after the creation of the IEB, the fields of economic botany and ethnobotany have greater preeminence as scientific disciplines and classes in these topics have grown from only a handful at universities in the 1980s to over 70 today. Several dozen graduates of the IEB\xe2\x80\x99s Ph.D. programs now teach or carry out research at many major institutions around the world, as well as in the private sector; it is this next generation who will continue and expand studies of this field.'

Abstract: 'About 4,500 free-living ciliate morphospecies have been described, applying an average synonymy rate of 20%. We estimate that 83\xe2\x80\x9389% of the ciliate diversity is still undescribed, using the following probabilities: detailed habitat studies suggest that the described number of morphospecies must be doubled: 4,500 \xe2\x86\x92 9,000; this figure has to be increased by about 50% due to species with similar interphase morphology but different resting cysts: 9,000 \xe2\x86\x92 13,500; the genetic and molecular data suggest that this value must be doubled or trebled: 13,500 \xe2\x86\x92 27,000 to 40,000 free-living, biological ciliate species. The knowledge on geographic distribution of ciliates heavily depends on flagship species and statistical analyses because reliable faunistic studies are rare and molecular data are still in its infancy. We present a list of 52 ciliate flagship species as a testable hypothesis, i.e., the hypothesis of restricted distribution of certain ciliate species must be refused when a considerable number of them is found in all or most biogeographic regions. Flagship species and statistical analyses consistently show Gondwanan and Laurasian ciliate communities, suggesting that the split of Pangaea deeply influenced ciliate distribution and rare species play a key role in geographic differentiation. However, there is also substantial evidence for continental, regional, and local endemism of free-living ciliates. The molecular studies usually show a high level of genetic diversity underlying ciliate morphospecies, suggesting that morphologic and molecular evolution may be decoupled in many ciliate species. Molecular studies on ciliate biogeography are at variance, possibly because most are still focusing on single molecular markers. In sum, the data indicate that ciliate biogeography is similar to that of plants and animals, but with an increased proportion of cosmopolites, favouring the moderate endemicity model.'

Abstract: 'Brazil has an amazing diversity in living species - plants, animals and microorganisms - due to its great territorial extension and combination of different biomes, such as the Cerrado, Atlantic forest, and Amazon rainforest [1].'

Abstract: 'In Brazil, at least 14 species of soft ticks (Argasidae) are associated with bats. While Ornithodoros hasei seems to be abundant among foliage-roosting bats, other groups of ticks are found exclusively inside caves. In this paper, noteworthy records of soft ticks infesting bats are documented in new localities from Bahia, Pernambuco, Piau\xc3\xad, and Rond\xc3\xb4nia states. Out of 201 bats examined, 25 were infested by 152 ticks belonging to seven taxa: Ornithodoros cavernicolous, O. hasei, Ornithodoros marinkellei, Ornithodoros cf. fonsecai, Ornithodoros cf. clarki, Antricola sp., and Nothoaspis amazoniensis. These findings provide new insights into the geographical distribution and host association of soft ticks occurring in the Neotropical region. Remarkably, morphological and biological observations about O. hasei are inferred based on the examination of on-host-collected first stage nymphs.'

Abstract: 'In ethnobotanical research, the investigation into traditional knowledge of medicinal plants in the context of migration has been of increasing interest in recent decades since it is influenced and changed by new environmental and social conditions. It most likely undergoes transformation processes to match the different living circumstances in the new location. This study compares the traditional knowledge of medicinal plants held by Tyroleans \xe2\x80\x93 and their descendants \xe2\x80\x93 who emigrated to Australia, Brazil and Peru at different time scales. The study\xe2\x80\x99s findings allow a discussion of the complexities and dynamics that influence this knowledge within the context of long-distance migration.'

Abstract: 'The effects of neighboring vegetation and soil fertility on the establishment, survival and growth of tree species were studied in a subtropical old-field area in south Brazil. Seed damage, germination and seedling establishment of four tree species plus growth and survival of two transplanted tree species were monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control). Facilitation was the main process affecting plant performance. The presence of pioneer vegetation significantly improved germination, establishment, growth and survival of most study species. Around 90% of sown seeds were damaged and the removal of pioneer vegetation significantly increased seed damage for all species studied, decreased germination in three out of four species, and decreased establishment in one species. Moreover a significantly higher seedling growth rate of Inga\xc2\xa0virescens was found after the first year of the experiment in plots where vegetation was present. The presence of vegetation significantly increased seedling survival of I.\xc2\xa0virescens by protecting seedlings from leaf loss due to winter frosts. Competition was detected by the second year when a higher growth of transplanted seedlings of the species Araucaria\xc2\xa0angustifolia occurred in plots where vegetation was present and fertilizer were applied. A lower growth rate was detected in plots where vegetation was present but fertilizer was not applied. These results indicate a balance between competition for soil nutrients and protection by neighbor vegetation. Damage of seedlings by leaf cutter ants was an important barrier for plant survival. Damage occurred in 80% of the A.\xc2\xa0angustifolia seedlings and 58% of these damaged seedlings died. The presence of neighboring vegetation tended to protect seedlings from ant damage. Although competition occurred, facilitation seems to be the main process driving early successional changes in this subtropical old field. This was mainly due to the improvement of local microclimatic conditions and protection against herbivores by neighboring vegetation. Facilitation occurred during establishment and growth phases in a subtropical area that is considered a productive, low stress environment. Our results indicate that facilitation may be more frequent in productive environments than previously thought.'

Abstract: 'Estimates of the extent of the discrimination against13CO2 during photosynthesis (\xce\x94A) on a global basis were made using gridded data sets of temperature, precipitation, elevation, humidity and vegetation type. Stomatal responses to leaf-to-air vapour mole fraction difference (D, leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference divided by atmospheric pressure) were first determined by a literature review and by assuming that stomatal behaviour results in the optimisation of plant water use in relation to carbon gain. Using monthly time steps, modelled stomatal responses toD were used to calculate the ratio of stomatal cavity to ambient CO2 mole fractions and then, in association with leaf internal conductances, to calculate \xce\x94A. Weighted according to gross primary productivity (GPP, annual net CO2 asimilation per unit ground area), estimated \xce\x94A for C3 biomes ranged from 12.9\xe2\x80\xb0 for xerophytic woods and shrub to 19.6\xe2\x80\xb0 for cool/cold deciduous forest, with an average value from C3 plants of 17.8\xe2\x80\xb0. This is slightly less than the commonly used values of 18\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\xb0. For C4 plants the average modelled discrimination was 3.6\xe2\x80\xb0, again slightly less than would be calculated from C4 plant dry matter carbon isotopic composition (yielding around 5\xe2\x80\xb0). From our model we estimate that, on a global basis, 21% of GPP is by C4 plants and for the terrestrial biosphere as a whole we calculate an average isotope discrimination during photosynthesis of 14.8\xe2\x80\xb0. There are large variations in \xce\x94A across the globe, the largest of which are associated with the precence or absence of C4 plants. Due to longitudinal variations in \xce\x94A, there are problems in using latitudinally averaged terrestrial carbon isotope discriminations to calculate the ratio of net oceanic to net terrestrial carbon fluxes.'

Abstract: 'Germplasm of the calabash tree (Crescentia cujete L.) was collected in five major regions of Colombia, i.e. the Andes, Caribbean, Amazon, Orinoco, and Pacific regions. Collecting this multipurpose tree was guided by the indigenous knowledge of farmers and artisans in each region. Large variation in fruit shapes and sizes was found, of which some forms were typical for certain regions. Overall 56 accessions were collected and roughly classified into 22 types by eight fruit shapes and eight sizes. Molecular markers (Amplified fragment length polymorphisms) were applied to leaf tip tissue originating from vegetatively propagated plants in order to assess the diversity available in the germplasm collected as well as to detect patterns of geographical or morphological similarity. One accession each of C. alata H.B.&K. and C. amazonica Ducke were used as outgroups. Overall, genetic diversity was high (mean Nei and Li\xe2\x80\x99s coefficient of 0.43). No relations could be established between either geographical provenance or fruit morphology and patterns of genetic diversity. Concerning the outgroups, the C. amazonica accession appeared to be a distinct species. The C. alata accession, however, did not seem to be sufficiently distinct from C. cujete to merit species status. The latter material may in fact be a hybrid or serve to challenge the validity of interspecific organization of the genus Crescentia.'

Abstract: 'The inter-Andean tropical rainforests and dry forests of the Magdalena river basin (Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot) in northern Colombia have undergone significant forest loss and degradation in recent decades. Six primate species inhabit this region, five of which are currently threatened with extinction and one of which\xe2\x80\x94the brown spider monkey, Ateles hybridus\xe2\x80\x94is considered critically endangered. Accurate and recent information on the distribution and conservation status of these threatened primate populations is scarce or nonexistent, even though such data are needed to implement successful conservation actions and management plans. Between 2006 and 2016, we evaluated the status and distribution of primates across inter-Andean lowland forests in northern Colombia. We visited 30 sites to evaluate the presence/absence of brown spider monkeys and other primate taxa in the region. We also carried out surveys at 10 of these sites to obtain estimates of primate population densities and demographic information from forests with different levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Novel data on primate presence/absence were obtained for 27 sites, and 136 records were collected in total. Only 33% of the sites visited were large forest fragments (>\xe2\x80\x89500\xc2\xa0Ha). This study confirms that at least six primate species are still present in the Rio Magdalena region, which represents the highest platyrrhine diversity west of the Andes. This study also confirms the persistence of a wild population of Colombian woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha lugens) in the Serran\xc3\xada de San Lucas. Assigning formal protected status to this region is an urgent priority for the conservation of primates in the Rio Magdalena region.'

Abstract: 'We used data from experimental plots (control, partially cut and clear-cut) established in 1998, in a tropical dry forest (TDF) in Jamaica, to assess changes in above ground biomass (AGB) 10\xc2\xa0years after disturbance. The treatments reduced AGB significantly in 1999 (partially cut: 37.6\xc2\xa0%, clear-cut: 94.4\xc2\xa0%) and after 10\xc2\xa0years, AGB did not recover overall, nor did it recover in the clear-cut plots. Partially cut plots, however, recovered the lost AGB in 10\xc2\xa0years via growth of uncut trees, which contributed significantly to biomass recovery, with only minor contributions from recruited trees and coppice shoots. For clear-cut plots, coppice shoots contributed significantly to the recovered AGB when compared with recruited biomass. Together, they recovered 26\xc2\xa0% of AGB lost, despite recovering 78\xc2\xa0% of the density and height of the control plots. The probability of survivorship decreased for trees with higher pre-treatment AGB values, but was higher for trees with multiple stems in 1998, regardless of treatment. The magnitude of biomass reduction varied among the species assessed and this had a differential effect on their ability to recover AGB. We estimate that it will take approximately 45.4\xc2\xa0years for the clear-cut plots to recover pre-treatment AGB; this is significantly longer than AGB recovery time for some successional rainforests on abandoned pastures/farmland. Consequently, this TDF may not be as resilient as tropical rainforests.'

Abstract: 'Tree species diversity was measured in a network of very small galleryforests within the Mountain Pine Ridge savanna in Belize. Research focussed onforest patches smaller than 1 ha in size (micro-forests) and linearstrips of trees along creeks lacking interior core zones with low understoreylight levels (tree thickets). Twenty-five micro-forests and 51 tree thicketsites were sampled throughout the savanna. A total of 144 morphospecies \xe2\x89\xa55cm dbh (106 in micro-forests and 117 in tree thickets) werefound, which represents 1/5 of the approximately 700 native tree species in Belize.Most (85.3%) of the species encountered are typically found in tropical rainforests and few are restricted to savanna or riparian environments. Speciesaccumulated at a much faster rate in micro-forests than in tree thickets. Onlyone species, the palm Acoelorraphe wrightii, was extremelyabundant, accounting for almost 30% of all stems. Many of the species werepresent in very low densities: 19% of all species found in micro-forests and 42%of those found in tree thickets had on average one or fewer stems per hectare. Alarge proportion of species were also found infrequently across the landscape,being present in only 36% of micro-forests and at 52% of tree thicket sites. Theresults indicate that networks of very small forest patches can contain highnumbers of species and could therefore contribute to the maintenance of regionalbiodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Fires are critical elements in the Earth System, linking climate, humans, and vegetation. With 200\xe2\x80\x93500 Mha burnt annually, fire disturbs a greater area over a wider variety of biomes than any other natural disturbance. Fire ignition, propagation, and impacts depend on the interactions among climate, vegetation structure, and land use on local to regional scales. Therefore, fires and their effects on terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to global change. Fires can cause dramatic changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. They have significant impacts on the atmosphere and biogeochemical cycles. By contributing significantly to greenhouse gas (e.g., with the release of 1.7\xe2\x80\x934.1 Pg of carbon per year) and aerosol emissions, and modifying surface properties, they affect not only vegetation but also climate. Fires also modify the provision of a variety of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, soil fertility, grazing value, biodiversity, and tourism, and can hence trigger land use change. Fires must therefore be included in global and regional assessments of vulnerability to global change. Fundamental understanding of vulnerability of land systems to fire is required to advise management and policy. Assessing regional vulnerabilities resulting from biophysical and human consequences of changed fire regimes under global change scenarios requires an integrated approach. Here we present a generic conceptual framework for such integrated, multidisciplinary studies. The framework is structured around three interacting (partially nested) subsystems whose contribute to vulnerability. The first subsystem describes the controls on fire regimes (exposure). A first feedback subsystem links fire regimes to atmospheric and climate dynamics within the Earth System (sensitivity), while the second feedback subsystem links changes in fire regimes to changes in the provision of ecological services and to their consequences for human systems (adaptability). We then briefly illustrate how the framework can be applied to two regional cases with contrasting ecological and human context: boreal forests of northern America and African savannahs.'

Abstract: 'The input of phosphorus (P) through mineral aerosol dust deposition may be an important component of nutrient dynamics in tropical forest ecosystems. A new dust deposition calculation is used to construct a broad analysis of the importance of dust-derived P to the P budget of a montane wet tropical forest in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. The dust deposition calculation used here takes advantage of an internal geochemical signal (Sr isotope mass balance) to provide a spatially integrated longer-term average dust deposition flux. Dust inputs of P (0.23\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.08\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) are compared with watershed-average inputs of P to the soil through the conversion of underlying saprolite into soil (between 0.07 and 0.19\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921), and with watershed-average losses of soil P through leaching (between 0.02 and 0.14\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) and erosion (between 0.04 and 1.38\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921). The similar magnitude of dust-derived P inputs to that of other fluxes indicates that dust is an important component of the soil and biomass P budget in this ecosystem. Dust-derived inputs of P alone are capable of completely replacing the total soil and biomass P pool on a timescale of between 2.8\xc2\xa0ka and 7.0\xc2\xa0ka, less than both the average soil residence time (~15\xc2\xa0ka) and the average landslide recurrence interval (~10\xc2\xa0ka).'

Abstract: 'Natural ecosystems are generally considered to be one of the most vulnerable sectors to negative impacts from rapid climate change. Australia\xe2\x80\x99s rich biodiversity is already under considerable threat from multiple human impacts, and climate change will impose additional stress. Opportunities for most Australian species to adapt to climate change by altering their distribution will be limited due to a number of characteristics of the Australian environment, both physical and biotic, including topography, habitat fragmentation, low capacity for dispersal and the restricted geographic ranges of many species. This review summarizes recent and projected climate trends in Australia and discusses how species may respond to these changes in the context of the particular environmental characteristics and biogeographic history of the continent. It also identifies particular regions and ecosystems likely to be most negatively affected in the short to medium term.'

Abstract: 'Cloud forests in central Guatemala are fragmented and decreasing in area due to slash-and-burn agricultural activities. We studied bird species composition, abundance, guild composition, and site tenacity of a 102\xc2\xa0ha plot located in a cloud forest region of the Sierra Yalijux in Guatemala, half of which was primary forest and half young secondary forest (<7-years-old). Of the 100 species present 14 were restricted to the Endemic Bird Area \xe2\x80\x98Northern Central American highlands\xe2\x80\x99 (i.e. 66% of a total of 21 endemics). Five of the 100 analysed species, including one of the restricted-range species (Troglodytes rufociliatus), had a significantly different abundance in primary and secondary forests. Theoretical analysis suggests that seven species out of a community comprised of 141 bird species are already extirpated and only three out of the 14 present restricted-range species might survive the current state of deforestation. Insectivores were the dominant guild on the plot in terms of numbers of species, followed by omnivores, frugivores and granivores. However, in terms of individuals, omnivores made up nearly half of the bird individuals in primary forest, but declined by 44% in secondary forest, whereas granivores more than doubled in this habitat type. Numbers of species per guild were not significantly different between habitats, while numbers of individuals per guild were significantly different. In general, individuals per species are significantly different in the two habitats. Results suggest that most of the species that are currently surviving in the remnant forests of the Sierra Yalijux might be fairly well adapted to a range of forest conditions, but that populations of a number of restricted-range species might be small. Even generalists species like the Common Bush Tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus) are less abundant in secondary vegetation than in primary forest of the study plot.'

Abstract: 'The current worldwide concern about tropical deforestation raises questions about the sustainability of avian populations in isolated forest fragments. One of the most important issues concerns the sizes of forest fragments necessary to maintain populations and the genetic variation within them. We address this by: (1) using mtDNA sequence variation to infer aspects of the population structure of four species of understory birds from four sites in southern Costa Rican rainforest; and (2) determining whether forest fragmentation that has occurred in the last 50\xc2\xa0years has had an effect on the amount of within-population variation for the species in question. High levels of between-population differentiation (D xy ) were found over a relatively small geographic scale (<130\xc2\xa0km) for white-breasted wood-wren (Henicorhina leucosticta), bicolored antbird (Gymnopithys leucaspis), and gray-headed tanager (Eucometis penicillata), suggesting that these species are highly sedentary and exhibit strong female philopatry. No mtDNA variation was found in Plain Antvireo (Dysithamnus mentalis). In all three of the polymorphic species there was a significant decrease in mtDNA nucleotide diversity in populations isolated by forest fragmentation as compared to populations in contiguous primary forest. Even in relatively large (250\xe2\x80\x931000\xc2\xa0ha) forest reserves, sedentary avian species have lost roughly half (range 43\xe2\x80\x9385) of the nucleotide diversity in mtDNA over a relatively short period of time. Our results indicate that sedentary avian species in forest fragments isolated by clearing have undergone severe reductions in effective population size due to population bottlenecks perpetuated by prolonged isolation and potential edge effects.'

Abstract: 'We analyzed the tolerance of Copaifera lucens seeds to submersion in water to assess the use of this species for direct seeding in riparian forest restoration programs. Seeds were submerged in water for 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 days or not submerged (control = 0 days of submergence). For the control and at the end of each period of submersion, germination and seedling vigor tests were carried out. For germination tests, seeds were sown in plastic pots containing sand and kept in laboratory conditions. The percentage of seed germination, the germination rate and the average germination time were analyzed. For seedlings, total biomass, leaf area, leaf mass per area and leaf area ratio were analyzed. Submersion time drastically affected the dissolved oxygen content and seed germination. Between 4 and 8 days of submersion there was a decrease from 83.8% to 15.6% in the germination percentage. No seed germination occurred after 16 days of submersion. Although there was a significant decrease in the percentage of seed germination between 4 and 8 days of submersion, seedling vigor was not affected. Seeds of this species were partially tolerant to submersion in water, suggesting that C. lucens is a promising species for direct seeding in riparian forest restoration projects.'

Abstract: 'As financial markets start to acknowledge the significance of environmental issues, it is interesting to analyse how they combine finance and sustainable development. Dutch investment funds participating in tropical forest plantations project high expected returns. However, they carry huge financial risks, in particular country risk, currency risk, price risk and credit risk. The environmental and developmental returns appear to be positive but rather small. In addition, the environmental and developmental risks do not appear to be very large, as most plantations are established on former farmland and the quantitative impact of the plantations is still limited.'

Abstract: 'During the Early Cretaceous, ocean-floor spreading gradually opened up the tropical Atlantic and the Indian Ocean basin widened as the eastern segments of Gondwanaland were conveyed farther apart. At the same time, epeiric seas were advancing on all continents, reaching maximum extent during the Cenomanian. The resultant trend to widespread, more equable climate favored the invasion into the lowlands of angiosperms whose postulated origin was in mild uplands at low latitudes during pre-Cretaceous times. As tropical and subtropical lands were rafted farther apart by ocean-floor spreading following Albian-Cenomanian times, new taxa (species, genera, tribes, families) evolved in isolation. This accounts in part for the increasing richness of the three major tropical floras following the Cretaceous. Changes in Mesozoic paleogeography also appear to clarify several other puzzling aspects of early angiosperm history and distribution, including their early appearance at middle latitudes.'

Abstract: 'A process-based approach to modelling the effects of land use change and climate change on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems was applied at global scale. Simulations were run both with and without land use change. In the absence of land use change between 1700 and 1990, carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems was predicted to increase by 145 Pg C. When land use change was represented during this period, terrestrial ecosystems became a net source of 97 Pg C. Land use change was directly responsible for a flux of 222 Pg C, slightly higher but close to estimates from other studies. The model was then run between 1990 and 2100 with a climate simulated by a GCM. Simulations were run with three land use change scenarios: 1. no land use change; 2. land use change specified by the SRES B2 scenario, and; 3. land use change scaled with population change in the B2 scenario. In the first two simulations with no or limited land use change, the net terrestrial carbon sink was substantial (358 and 257 Pg C, respectively). However, with the population-based land-use change scenario, the losses of carbon through land use change were close to the carbon gains through enhanced net ecosystem productivity, resulting in a net sink near zero. Future changes in land use are highly uncertain, but will have a large impact on the future terrestrial carbon balance. This study attempts to provide some bounds on how land use change may affect the carbon sink over the nextcentury.'

Abstract: 'Close correspondence between stable carbon isotope ratios (\xce\xb4 13 C), pollen, and charcoal profiles in sediment cores from Laguna Zoncho and Machita swamp, Costa Rica, shows that prehistoric forest clearance and crop cultivation can be detected in the stable carbon isotope ratios of total organic carbon (\xce\xb4 13C TOC ). Analyses of \xc3\x8e\xc2\xb4 13C TOC  complement evidence from pollen, charcoal, and phytoliths and provide a proxy that is sensitive to the intensity and/or proximity to core sites of prehistoric forest clearance and agriculture in watersheds. Stable carbon isotope analyses are particularly useful in situations in which other evidence of forest clearance and agriculture is limited.'

Abstract: 'Through the ethnographic record of the subsistence activities partially or completely performed in the domestic sphere in two Mby\xc3\xa1-Guaran\xc3\xad settlements in Misiones (Argentina), we outline factors important in describing the local natural environment. Data was collected through systematic observation and also through semi-structured interviews. Analysis indicates that the natural environment of the area is characterized by the indigenous community in several different ways. Thus, local people view the environment as made up of different \xe2\x80\x9cmicro-environments,\xe2\x80\x9d and they consequently think of the elements that compose these \xe2\x80\x9cmicro-environments\xe2\x80\x9d as having different, distinct characteristics. In the context of their daily activities, both these \xe2\x80\x9cmicro-environments\xe2\x80\x9d and the elements that compose them are regarded as resources, in that they are viewed in terms of what is in them relevant to the subsistence of these groups in the rainforest. It is the intention of this study to initiate the systematic recording and processing of information on how these indigenous communities know and manage the natural resources available to them in their daily life.'

Abstract: 'Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii is the primary vector of human and simian malarias in Brazilian regions covered by the Atlantic Rainforest. Previous studies found that An. cruzii presents high levels of behavioural, chromosomal and molecular polymorphisms, which led to the hypothesis that it may be a complex of cryptic species. Here, An. cruzii specimens were collected in five sites in South-East Brazil located at different altitudes on the inner and coastal slopes of two mountain ranges covered by Atlantic Rainforest, known as Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueria. Partial sequences for two genes (Clock and cpr) were generated and compared with previously published sequences from Florian\xc3\xb3polis (southern Brazil). Genetic diversity was analysed with estimates of population structure (F ST ) and haplotype phylogenetic trees in order to understand how many species of the complex may occur in this biome and how populations across the species distribution are related.'

Abstract: ' Tropical forests play a disproportionately large role in the global climate system, yet the extent to which nutrients limit the potential for tropical trees to increase carbon gain as atmospheric carbon dioxide rises is unknown. '

Abstract: 'Community forestry is practiced in various countries throughout the world, with respect to both native forests and plantations, for livelihood and forest protection purposes and also for urban amenity values. While forests have been managed to some extent by communities for thousands of years, modern models of community forestry have been practiced widely for only about 30 years. Community forestry takes many forms; there is no unique definition or categorisation, although a number of characteristics are frequently present. There is in general, involvement of a local community in forest planning as well as management, for a form of forestry which is usually relatively small-scale, motivated by multiple objectives, and receiving some financial support and organisational assistance by government and non-government organisations. Where plantations are established, these may be managed as common property, individual property rights may apply, or there may be a combination of both. Analysis of the specific research studies included in this issue reveals that community forestry systems have been refined over time as experience is gained in program designs, and notable successes have been achieved. However, \xe2\x80\x98the jury is still out\xe2\x80\x99 on whether community forestry has lived up to the optimistic expectations of its proponents.'

Abstract: 'Due to the increasing search for alternative sources of natural rubber (NR) whose properties are similar to Hevea brasiliesis, several sources have been studied in the past few years. Among them, Mangabeira (Hancornia speciosa Gomes), which is native to Amazon rainforest and other regions of Brazil, has a potential as another viable rubber source. As a continuation of a series of comparative studies between Hancornia and Hevea (clone RRIM 600) these two species by our research team, their thermal behavior was analyzed by thermogravimetry (TG) using Flynn\xe2\x80\x93Wall\xe2\x80\x93Ozawa\xe2\x80\x99s approach in order to obtain kinetic parameters (reaction order, pre-exponential factor and activation energy) of the decomposition process. Results indicated that the thermal behavior of NR from Hancornia was comparable to Hevea with some differences observed as follows: reaction order for Hancornia was higher than for Hevea at the beginning of degradation and very close for temperatures over 350\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C; activation energy and pre-exponential factor had the same trend, i.e., increased with increasing degree of conversion remaining almost constant between 20 and 70% and then increasing for higher degrees, although Hevea was slightly more thermally stable than Hancornia. These major influences in the degradation process in the early stage are attributed to differences in non-rubber constituents present in these two species.'

Abstract: 'This article concerns contemporary problems of indigenous peoples and human rights. In general, the human rights of indigenous people occupy marginal space in the global discourse. Overcoming cultural hurdles, and recognizing that indigenous peoples are not objects of juridical concern, not abstractions of analytically precise units of analysis, but in fact are subjects who come with perspectives of identity, demand and expectations, is a necessary starting point for both the scholar and the advocate. This article deals with a particular indigenous nation in the Amazon: the Shuar. The Shuar hold important perspectives of identity, demand and expectation encompassing the critical values that sustain their lives in the community.'

Abstract: 'Road construction and transportation generate significant environmental impacts. Hence, it is increasingly important to understand the environmental burdens produced throughout the different stages of road development: construction, maintenance, traffic, and end-of-life. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used as an environmental management methodology to determine the impacts associated with a 22.4\xc2\xa0km stretch of the South Pan-American (PS) highway in the province of Lima, Peru, one of the main access routes for traffic and goods entering Lima, located in a hyper-arid area parallel to the Pacific Ocean.'

Abstract: 'The vertical stratification of bird species has been intensively studied in both temperate and tropical bird communities. I investigated the vertical stratification of bird species and their use of vegetation structures and light habitats using observation data from 92 rainforest species. Most observations were made from a 40 m high canopy crane situated close to the Surumoni river (65\xc2\xb040\xe2\x80\xb2W, 3\xc2\xb010\xe2\x80\xb2N) near Esmeralda, Estado Amazonas, southern Venezuela. Further observations were made at several forest sites nearby. Previous analyses had shown that bird species foraged in stratified vertical niches, with wider niches for midstorey birds than for either canopy or understorey birds. In this study, I used across-species as well as phylogenetically-controlled analyses to correlate the vertical position of bird species with variables relating to vegetation structures and the amount of illumination. I found that species which foraged low in the forest were mostly found in small gap and forest shade light habitats, while species that foraged high were mostly found in large gap and woodland shade light habitats. Furthermore it was the lower-foraging species that were more often found in dimmer light conditions inside denser cover. In correspondence with their wider vertical niches, midstorey birds foraged in a wider range of light habitats and illumination than either canopy or understorey birds. While preserving their overall stratification, species actively moved within their preferred stratum, e. g. downwards and into denser vegetation during hours of strong sunlight and around midday when temperatures are highest. Bird activity appeared to be lowest shortly after midday, as I discovered when controlling for the effects of chance encounters with multi-species flocks. These observations are important not only for the determination of foraging niches, but also for the study of crypsis and the conspicuousness of a bird species in relation to its foraging stratum.'

Abstract: 'Soil degradation, caused by land misuse and soil mismanagement, has plagued humanity since the dawn of settled agriculture. Many once thriving civilizations collapsed due to erosion, salinization, nutrient depletion and other soil degradation processes. The Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, that saved hundreds of millions from starvation in Asia and elsewhere, by-passed Sub-Saharan Africa. This remains the only region in the world where the number of hungry and food-insecure populations will still be on the increase even by 2020. The serious technological and political challenges are being exacerbated by the rising energy costs. Resource-poor and small-size land-holders can neither afford the expensive input nor are they sure of their effectiveness because of degraded soils and the harsh, changing climate. Consequently, crop yields are adversely impacted by accelerated erosion, and depletion of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrients because of the extractive farming practices. Low crop yields, despite growing improved varieties, are due to the severe soil degradation, especially the low SOM reserves and poor soil structure that aggravate drought stress. Components of recommended technology include: no-till; residue mulch and cover crops; integrated nutrient management; and biochar used in conjunction with improved crops (genetically modified, biotechnology) and cropping systems, and energy plantation for biofuel production. However, its low acceptance, e.g. for no-till farming, is due to a range of biophysical, social and economic factors. Competing uses of crop residues for other needs is among numerous factors limiting the adoption of no-till farming. Creating another income stream for resource-poor farmers, through payments for ecosystem services, e.g., C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems, is an important strategy for promoting the adoption of recommended technologies. Adoption of improved soil management practices is essential to adapt to the changing climate, and meeting the needs of growing populations for food, fodder, fuel and fabrics. Soil restoration and sustainable management are essential to achieving food security, and global peace and stability.'

Abstract: 'The Amazonian brown brocket deer (Mazama nemorivaga) is an endemic species of the Amazon rainforest region, which has suffered constant threats due to hunting and increasing deforestation. Artificial insemination (AI), combined with genomic banks, is considered an important tool for maintaining conservation programs of endangered species; however, the number of live offspring born from AI in non-domesticated cervids is extremely low. Thus, studies designed to develop, adapt, or enhance AI techniques are of fundamental importance. This report describes a successful transposition of the cervix with semen deposition in the uterine lumen of a M. nemorivaga female, based on the transcervical AI technique used in sheep, as well as using specific tools develop for IA in small ruminants, which have resulted in the birth of a healthy male fawn.'

Abstract: 'This study investigates the impact of global warming on the savannization of the tropical land region and also examines the relative roles of the impact of the increase of greenhouse gas concentration and future changes in land cover on the tropical climate. For this purpose, a mechanistic\xe2\x80\x93statistical\xe2\x80\x93dynamical climate model with a bidirectional interaction between vegetation and climate is used. The results showed that climate change due to deforestation is more than that due to greenhouse gases in the tropical region. The warming due to deforestation corresponds to around 60% of the warming in the tropical region when the increase of CO2 concentration is included together. However, the global warming due to deforestation is negligible. On the other hand, with the increase of CO2 concentration projected for 2100, there is a lower decrease of evapotranspiration, precipitation and net surface radiation in the tropical region compared with the case with only deforestation. Differently from the case with only deforestation, the effect of the changes in the net surface radiation overcomes that due to the evapotranspiration, so that the warming in the tropical land region is increased. The impact of the increase of CO2 concentration on a deforestation scenario is to increase the reduction of the areas covered by tropical forest (and a corresponding increase in the areas covered by savanna) which may reach 7.5% in future compared with the present climate. Compared with the case with only deforestation, drying may increase by 66.7%. This corroborates with the hypothesis that the process of savannization of the tropical forest can be accelerated in future due to global warming.'

Abstract: 'A survey of crustose microlichens at Los Amigos Biological Station in Amazonian Peru revealed 116 species of Graphidaceae at this site. This is the second highest number of Graphidaceae ever reported for a single site world-wide, after the Surumoni crane station in Venezuela, with 131 species, and followed by Fakahatchee Strand Park Preserve in Florida, with 111 species. Based on the number of Graphidaceae found at Los Amigos, we predict the total lichen species richness at this site to be approximately 700 species.

Abstract: 'This study analyzed the evolution of socioeconomic, sanitary, and personal factors as well as spatiotemporal changes in the prevalence of helminthiasis and giardiasis in urban Amazonian children between 2003 and 2011. Child age, lack of sanitation, and lack of access to bottled water were identified as significant associated factors for helminthiasis and giardiasis. There was an overall improvement in socioeconomic and sanitary conditions in the city resulting in decreased helminth prevalences from 12.42 to 9.63% between 2003 and 2010, but the prevalence increased to 15.03% in 2011 due to migratory movement and unstable sanitary conditions. As for Giardiasis, socioeconomic and environmental changes were not enough to reduce prevalence (16% in 2003 and 23% in 2011). Spatial analysis identified a significant cluster for helminthiasis in an area of poor housing conditions. Control programs in the Amazon need to target high-risk areas focusing changes in sanitation, water usage, and health education.'

Abstract: 'Residual soils (saprolites) developed on crystalline rocks appear to form by an essentially isovolumetric process (i.e. without dilation or compaction). Isovolumetric geochemical analysis of a suite of saprolite samples developed on a common parent rock can be used to estimate the relative rates of long-term losses of P and Si during weathering. Using the export of dissolved Si in rivers as a weathering index, one can then estimate the rate of P release due to chemical weathering by means of the P-Si loss ratio in saprolite. For three basins where data are available (Liberty Hill, SC; Amazon River, Brazil: Rio Negro, Brazil) estimated P weathering release rates are 163, 457, and 242 moles P km\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921 respectively. These compare to precipitation inputs of 684, 700 and 630 moles P km\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921 and total river exports of 256, 4490 and 820 moles P km\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The Rio Negro shows a near perfect balance between the input of P via precipitation and chemical weathering and the riverine output of dissolved and suspended P. This system, however, raised the unsolved problem of the source that supports the atmospheric P input.'

Abstract: "\xe2\x80\x82The behavioral response of the obligate bamboo-nesting ant Cataulacus muticus to nest flooding was studied in a perhumid tropical rainforest in Malaysia and in the laboratory. The hollow internodes of giant bamboo, in which C. muticus exclusively nests, are prone to flooding by heavy rains. The ants showed a two-graded response to flooding. During heavy rain workers block the nest entrances with their heads to reduce water influx. However, rainwater may still intrude into the nest chamber. The ants respond by drinking the water, leaving the nest and excreting water droplets on the outer stem surface. This cooperative 'peeing' behavior is a new survival mechanism adaptive to the ants' nesting ecology. Laboratory experiments conducted with two other Cataulacus species, C. catuvolcus colonizing small dead twigs and C. horridus inhabiting rotten wood, did not reveal any form of water-bailing behavior."

Abstract: 'Anthropogenic grasslands, meaning grasslands that have been influenced and modified by humans, are one of the most important land covers of the tropics, but their management is dominated by conflicted and contested views, which is reflected in the problematic record of grassland development intervention. This chapter analyzes the historic, cultural, political, and institutional factors that affect the way grasslands are viewed, drawing largely on data from Southeast Asia. These data suggest that perceptions of grasslands are colored in part by the marginal place that they occupy in the cosmology of western industrialized societies, which idealize forest covers. Consequently, national and international agencies view grasslands not as a common land cover but as a development problem. The agendas of government and development agencies are often not grounded in a proper understanding of the local human and bio-physical ecology of grasslands or of successful local agroforestry practices; and research on many of the most important dimensions of grassland management is poorly conducted and/or utilized. The recent rise in scientific interest in indigenous knowledge, environmental history, and non-equilibrium systems, has opened up new possibilities for the study of grasslands. Agroforestry, given its inherent bridging of nature and culture, is ideally suited to benefit from these possibilities, by focusing research attention on the bio-social factors that determine the appearance, disappearance, and maintenance of anthropogenic grasslands.'

Abstract: 'The geographical characteristics of a total of 1839 forest fragments surrounded by sugar cane fields were studied in the Brazilian Atlantic rain forest region of the northeastern state of Pernambuco. The size and shape of the fragments as well as inter-fragment distances and the effects of varying edge width were examined using a geographical information system. The analyses show that the fragments are relatively small and close to each other. Approximately 48% of the rain forest fragments are <10 hectares, while only about 7% are >100 hectares. Forest fragments are close to each other, as fragments located 50m or less apart formed groups that included ca. 50% of the total forest area. At 350m inter-fragment distance, 98% of the rain forest area was included in groups of fragments. Due to the small size and irregular shape of the fragments, the total area of edge zone exceeds that of the interior habitat when the edge width is ca. 60m. At an edge width of 300m ca. 94% of the total fragment area is edge zone. For conservation purposes, ways of establishing networks of forest fragments connected by corridors and stepping stone fragments are demonstrated using GIS. Simulations using these techniques show that reforestation of sugar cane fields between the forest fragments would considerably increase the area of interior forest habitat and connectivity between fragments.'

Abstract: ' Late-Quaternary sections (about 1\xc2\xa0Ma) from the Congo deep-sea fan (ODP Leg 175, site\xc2\xa01075) were used to reconstruct the terrigenous organic matter supply to the easternmost equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Variations in quantity and quality of the riverine organic matter reflect the interaction between the paleoclimatic development within the continental catchment area and the paleoceanographic conditions in the Congo river plume. To characterize the delivery of organic matter from terrigenous and marine sources, we used elemental and bulk carbon isotopic analyses, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, lignin chemistry, and organic petrology. High-amplitude fluctuations occurring about every 15\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xa0ka reveal a mainly precessional control on organic sedimentation. Results from Rock-Eval pyrolysis indicate a mixed kerogen type III/II, as would be anticipated in front of a major river. Fluctuations in Tmax from Rock-Eval pyrolysis demonstrate pronounced cyclic changes in the delivery of low- and high-mature organic matter. Contribution of the low-mature organic fraction was strongest during warm climates supporting enhanced marine production offshore of the Congo. Organic petrological observations confirm the existence of abundant terrigenous plant tissues, both non-oxidized (vitrinite) and oxidized (inertinite). Charcoal-like organic matter (fusinite) is attributed to periods of increased bush fires in the continental hinterland, and implies more arid climatic conditions. Results from ratios of specific phenolic lignin components suggest that terrigenous organic matter in Late-Quaternary sections of site\xc2\xa01075 mainly derives from non-woody angiosperm tissue, i.e., grasses and leaves. Correlation between the amount of specific lignin phenols and the bulk \xce\xb413Corg signature fosters the conclusion that an appreciable amount of the terrigenous organic fraction derives from C4 plant matter. This may cause an underestimation of the terrigenous proportion of bulk organic matter when assessments are based on bulk carbon isotopic signatures alone.'

Abstract: ' The distributions of organic matter in the tropical swamps in southern Thailand are reported. The concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC) in the Bang Nara River, which drains swamp forests and nearby paddy fields, were 2.9 \xc2\xb1 2.0 and 6.2 \xc2\xb1 1.3 mg C l\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. Although the variation was large, DOC concentration in the Bang Nara River seemed to be higher than POC in November 1992 (DOC/POC ratio, 2.8 \xc2\xb1 2.2). River waters from the upland areas were characterized by low POC and DOC concentrations as compared with Bang Nara River water. The \xce\xb413C values of POC and river sediments were useful to distinguish between organic matter originating in upland and swamp areas. It is suggested that the distributions of organic matter and its isotopic composition reflect the difference in drainage characteristics between lowland swamp and upland areas. Isotopic analyses of plant leaves and soils revealed that the swamp forest ecosystems were characterized by low \xce\xb413C and low \xce\xb415N values, which suggested low efficiency of water use by plants and large contributions of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, respectively. Although CO2 recycling in the forest might be an important factor determining the \xce\xb413C values of understory plants, the main process in carbon metabolism of tropical swamp forests would be CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and forest canopy.'

Abstract: 'Identifying factors that cause genetic differentiation in plant populations and the spatial scale at which genetic structuring can be detected will help to understand plant population dynamics and identify conservation units. In this study, we determined the genetic structure and diversity of Pterocarpus officinalis, a widespread tropical wetland tree, at three spatial scales: (1) drainage basin \xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d (<10\xc2\xa0km), (2) within Puerto Rico (<100\xc2\xa0km), and (3) Caribbean-wide (>1000\xc2\xa0km) using AFLP. At all three spatial scales, most of the genetic variation occurred within populations, but as the spatial scale increased from the watershed to the Caribbean region, there was an increase in the among population variation (\xce\xa6ST=0.19 to \xce\xa6ST=0.53). At the watershed scale, there was no significant differentiation (P=0.77) among populations in the different watersheds, although there was some evidence that montane and coastal populations differed (P<0.01). At the island scale, there was significant differentiation (P<0.001) among four populations in Puerto Rico. At the regional scale (>1000\xc2\xa0km), we found significant differentiation (P<0.001) between island and continental populations in the Caribbean region, which we attributed to factors associated with the colonization history of P. officinalis in the Neotropics. Given that genetic structure can occur from local to regional spatial scales, it is critical that conservation recommendations be based on genetic information collected at the appropriate spatial scale.'

Abstract: 'Environmental issues and the future sustainability of society are among the greatest concerns facing society today. How to formulate a pathway toward a sustainable society is a critical question. Several issues associated with this question are presented and discussed. First, a structuring of the issues is presented. The environment can be said to consist of three systems\xe2\x80\x94the natural, social, and human\xe2\x80\x94and their interactions; environmental problems may therefore be defined in terms of perturbations of the interactions among the three systems. A sustainable society can be realized by restoring these interactions. Next, the characteristics of the issues are discussed. Because environmental issues relate to the future, forecasts of the future are essential. Because it is impossible to predict the future with complete accuracy, however, we should develop a method of using information about the future with allowance for error. It should be noted that error characteristics differ according to their time-scale. Third, the relationship between environmental issues and society is discussed. To take collective action on these issues we need society-wide consensus, which requires a reliable and objective platform. Here, more attention must be paid to the distribution of knowledge across society, because scientific knowledge in a modern society tends to be monopolized by research organizations. The role of the media is therefore important. Another important factor is the commitment of the general public; user-friendly ways of galvanizing such commitment should be developed.'

Abstract: 'Multiresolution decomposition is applied to 10 months of nocturnal turbulence observations taken at eight levels within and above a forest canopy in Central Amazonia. The aim is to identify the contributions of different temporal scales of the flow above and within the canopy. Results show that turbulence intensity in the lower canopy is mostly affected by the static stability in the upper canopy. Horizontal velocity fluctuations peak at time scales longer than 100 s within the canopy, which correspond to the scale of non-turbulent submeso motions above the canopy. In the vertical velocity spectrum near the surface, the peak occurs at time scales around 100 s, which are larger than the time scales of the turbulent flow above the canopy. Heat-flux cospectra within the canopy peak at the same temporal scales as the vertical velocity fluctuations at that level, suggesting the existence of buoyancy driven turbulence. Case studies are presented as evidence that low-frequency fluctuations propagate towards the canopy interior more easily than does turbulence.'

Abstract: 'The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is native to the Amazon region and it is the major source of natural rubber in the world. Rubber tree breeding is time-consuming and expensive. However, molecular markers such as microsatellites can reduce the time required for these programs. This study reports new genomic microsatellite markers developed and characterized in H. brasiliensis and the evaluation of their transferability to other Hevea species.'

Abstract: 'To assess the susceptibility of the base metal budget of a remote tropical montane forest in Ecuador to environmental change, we determined the extent of biological control of base metal fluxes and explored the impact of atmospheric inputs and precipitation, considered as potential drivers of ecosystem change, on the base metal fluxes. We quantified all major base metal fluxes in a ca. 9.1\xc2\xa0ha forested catchment from 1998 to 2013. Mean (\xc2\xb1s.d.) annual flux to the soil via throughfall\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0stemflow\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0litterfall was 13800\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01500\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 Ca, 19000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01510\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 K, 4690\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0619\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 Mg and 846\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0592\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 Na of which 22\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa06, 45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa016, 39\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa010 and 84\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa033%, respectively, were leached to below the organic layer. The mineral soil retained 79\xe2\x80\x9394% of this Ca, K and Mg, while Na was released. Weathering rates estimated with three different approaches ranged from not detected (ND) to 504\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 Ca, ND-1770\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 K, 287\xe2\x80\x93597\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 Mg and 403\xe2\x80\x93540\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 Na. The size of mainly biologically controlled aboveground fluxes of Ca, K and Mg was 1\xe2\x80\x932 orders of magnitude larger than that of mainly geochemically controlled fluxes (sorption to soil and weathering). The elemental catchment budgets (total deposition \xe2\x88\x92 streamflow) were positive for Ca (574\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0893\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922) and K (1330\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0773\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922), negative for Na (\xe2\x88\x92370\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01300\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922) and neutral for Mg (1.89\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0304\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922). Our results demonstrate that biological processes controlled element retention for Ca, K and Mg in the biological part of the ecosystem. This was different for Na, which was mainly released by weathering from the study catchment, while the biological part of the ecosystem was Na-poor. The deposition of base metals was the strongest driver of their budgets suggesting that the base metal cycling of the study ecosystem is susceptible to changing deposition.'

Abstract: 'This paper reviews the research on land use change and its corresponding ecological responses. Patterns of land use changes in spatio-temporal level are produced by the interaction of biophysical and socio-economic processes. Nowadays, the studies derived from different socioeconomic conditions and scales show that at short-term scale, human activities, rather than natural forces, have become a major force in shaping the environment, while biophysical factors control the trends and processes of land use change under the macro environmental background. Providing a scientific understanding of the process of land use change, the impacts of different land use decisions, and the ways that decisions are affected by a changing environment and increasing ecological variability are the priority areas for research: (1) explanation of scale dependency of drivers of land use change; (2) quantification of driving factors of land use change; (3) incorporation of biophysical feedbacks in land use change models; and (4) underlying processes and mechanisms of ecological impacts of land use change.'

Abstract: 'In India, slash and burn agriculture is one of the major factors contributing to deforestation, especially in the hilly north-eastern region and Eastern Ghats. Studies on vegetation dynamics associated with slash and burn agricultural practices have been intensively studied in the north-eastern part of India. These have covered semi-evergreen/evergreen vegetation, but similar studies on tropical mixed dry deciduous ecosystems are not as common. In the present study, we used the century ecosystem model to study vegetation dynamics in shifting cultivation areas on the mixed dry deciduous forests covering the Eastern Ghats of India. The site-specific parameters, temperature, precipitation, biomass and nutrient pools were used, and, by collecting information from local management practices, a 12-year shifting cultivation cycle during a 70-year period from 1960 to 2030 was simulated. century estimated a total loss of 239 tonnes carbon (tC) in soil organic matter over the simulation period, and the total nitrogen content of the soil organic matter showed an initial increase followed by a decline (344.3 g m2 during 1960 to less than 318.3 g m2 during 2030). century estimated that 66 tC ha\xe2\x88\x921 would be lost from the forest system, reducing the initial forest system carbon level from 118.5 tC ha\xe2\x88\x921. An increase in productivity from 0.49 tC ha\xe2\x88\x921 during 1960 to 1.2 tC ha\xe2\x88\x921 during the initial forest slash and burn in 1962 was observed, but thereafter productivity declined to 0.7 tC ha\xe2\x88\x921 during the year 2030. Results obtained in other studies of similar types of agricultural practices are also reviewed.'

Abstract: 'Humans utilise about 40% of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s net primary production (NPP) but the products of this NPP are often managed by different sectors, with timber and forest products managed by the forestry sector and food and fibre products from croplands and grasslands managed by the agricultural sector. Other significant anthropogenic impacts on the global carbon cycle include human utilization of fossil fuels and impacts on less intensively managed systems such as peatlands, wetlands and permafrost. A great deal of knowledge, expertise and data is available within each sector. We describe the contribution of sectoral carbon budgets to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Whilst many sectors exhibit similarities for carbon budgeting, some key differences arise due to differences in goods and services provided, ecology, management practices used, land-management personnel responsible, policies affecting land management, data types and availability, and the drivers of change. We review the methods and data sources available for assessing sectoral carbon budgets, and describe some of key data limitations and uncertainties for each sector in different regions of the world. We identify the main gaps in our knowledge/data, show that coverage is better for the developed world for most sectors, and suggest how sectoral carbon budgets could be improved in the future. Research priorities include the development of shared protocols through site networks, a move to full carbon accounting within sectors, and the assessment of full greenhouse gas budgets.'

Abstract: ' The periodicity of growth ring formation was studied in Tabebuia cassinoides (Lam.) DC, Tabebuia umbellata (Sond.) Sandwith, Symphonia globulifera L., and Alchornea sidifolia M\xc3\xbcll. Arg. in a swamp forest within the Atlantic Rain Forest of the state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Mechanical wounds of the vascular cambium allowed cyclic growth to be observed, and the position of latewood relative to the wounds was analysed. Radial growth was correlated with phenology, temperature, precipitation, photoperiod, flooding regime, and endogenous rhythms. All species showed annual growth rings; however, there were different patterns of radial growth. Phenology was an important factor influencing the activity of the vascular cambium. The period of leaf abscission was correlated with the formation of latewood in three of the species studied, but it occurred at different times for each species. Flooding was a determinant of periodic growth in T. cassinoides; photoperiod was indirectly responsible for radial growth rhythm in T. umbellata, and endogenous rhythms accounted for the radial growth rhythm of S. globulifera and A. sidifolia.'

Abstract: 'Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) calls for stabilization of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations at levels that prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference (DAI) in the climate system. However, some of the recent policy literature has focused on dangerous climatic change (DCC) rather than on DAI. DAI is a set of increases in GHGs concentrations that has a non-negligible possibility of provoking changes in climate that in turn have a non-negligible possibility of causing unacceptable harm, including harm to one or more of ecosystems, food production systems, and sustainable socio-economic systems, whereas DCC is a change of climate that has actually occurred or is assumed to occur and that has a non-negligible possibility of causing unacceptable harm. If the goal of climate policy is to prevent DAI, then the determination of allowable GHG concentrations requires three inputs: the probability distribution function (pdf) for climate sensitivity, the pdf for the temperature change at which significant harm occurs, and the allowed probability (\xe2\x80\x9crisk\xe2\x80\x9d) of incurring harm previously deemed to be unacceptable. If the goal of climate policy is to prevent DCC, then one must know what the correct climate sensitivity is (along with the harm pdf and risk tolerance) in order to determine allowable GHG concentrations. DAI from elevated atmospheric CO2 also arises through its impact on ocean chemistry as the ocean absorbs CO2. The primary chemical impact is a reduction in the degree of supersaturation of ocean water with respect to calcium carbonate, the structural building material for coral and for calcareous phytoplankton at the base of the marine food chain. Here, the probability of significant harm (in particular, impacts violating the subsidiary conditions in Article 2 of the UNFCCC) is computed as a function of the ratio of total GHG radiative forcing to the radiative forcing for a CO2 doubling, using two alternative pdfs for climate sensitivity and three alternative pdfs for the harm temperature threshold. The allowable radiative forcing ratio depends on the probability of significant harm that is tolerated, and can be translated into allowable CO2 concentrations given some assumption concerning the future change in total non-CO2 GHG radiative forcing. If future non-CO2 GHG forcing is reduced to half of the present non-CO2 GHG forcing, then the allowable CO2 concentration is 290\xe2\x80\x93430\xc2\xa0ppmv for a 10% risk tolerance (depending on the chosen pdfs) and 300\xe2\x80\x93500\xc2\xa0ppmv for a 25% risk tolerance (assuming a pre-industrial CO2 concentration of 280\xc2\xa0ppmv). For future non-CO2 GHG forcing frozen at the present value, and for a 10% risk threshold, the allowable CO2 concentration is 257\xe2\x80\x93384\xc2\xa0ppmv. The implications of these results are that (1) emissions of GHGs need to be reduced as quickly as possible, not in order to comply with the UNFCCC, but in order to minimize the extent and duration of non-compliance; (2) we do not have the luxury of trading off reductions in emissions of non-CO2 GHGs against smaller reductions in CO2 emissions, and (3) preparations should begin soon for the creation of negative CO2 emissions through the sequestration of biomass carbon.'

Abstract: 'Climatic extremes such as drought have becoming a severe climate-related problem in many regions all over the world that can induce anomalies in vegetation condition. Growth and CO2 uptake by plants are constrained to a large extent by drought. Therefore, it is important to understand the spatial and temporal responses of vegetation to drought across the various land cover types and different regions. Leaf area index (LAI) derived from Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) data was used to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought occurrence across Yunnan Province, China (2001\xe2\x80\x932010). The meteorological drought was assessed based on Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values. Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s correlation coefficients between LAI and SPI were examined across several timescales within six sub-regions of the Yunnan. Further, the drought-prone area was identified based on LAI anomaly values. Lag and cumulative effects of lack of precipitation on vegetation were evident, with significant correlations found using 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month timescale. We found 9-month timescale has higher correlations compared to another timescale. Approximately 29.4% of Yunnan\xe2\x80\x99s area was classified as drought-prone area, based on the LAI anomaly values. Most of this drought-prone area was distributed in the mountainous region of Yunnan. From the research, it is evident that GLASS LAI can be effectively used as an indicator for assessing drought conditions and it provide valuable information for drought risk defense and preparedness.'

Abstract: 'The ecological characteristics of a species, along with small-scale landscape features are known to affect the patterns of genetic structure within populations. Due to dispersal limitation, closely-related individuals tend to be closer spatially, leading to spatial genetic structure. Physical barriers also may prevent individuals from dispersing further, and lead individuals on one side of a barrier to be more related than individuals from different sides. We tested these hypotheses by examining patterns of fine-scale spatial genetic structure within populations of three relatively sedentary Amazonian-forest understorey birds that differ in their ecological requirements. We sampled birds in a 10,000\xc2\xa0ha reserve, covered by largely undisturbed old-growth forests and traversed by a central ridge. We found positive spatial genetic structure at short distances only for Percnostola rufifrons, a treefall-gap specialist. Positive genetic structure occurred at 6\xc2\xa0km for Glyphorynchus spirurus, a solitary bark-forager; no spatial genetic structure was found for Gymnopithys rufigula, an army-ant follower. Individuals of none of the three species were more related on a given side of the ridgeline than between different sides but, at greater distances, there was a tendency of individuals located on opposite sides of the ridgeline to be less related than individuals located on the same side, for all species analysed. Our study indicates that local topographic features do not prevent, but likely reduce, gene flow within populations in continuous forests, and that the development of fine-scale spatial genetic structure may depend on the dispersal propensity of a species. Thus, studies of species assemblages need to account for the different ecological characteristics of the constituent species.'

Abstract: 'In this article, I offer an ethnographic and historical analysis of an alternative governmental project emerging in Ampiyacu basin, a highly biodiverse tropical area in Peruvian Amazonia. By considering the ways in which the Bora and Huitoto communities produce and deal with procedures and documentation that evoke the traditional structures of the State bureaucracy, I seek to understand the complex means by which these communities relate to the State\xe2\x80\x99s forms of authority in their attempts to self-regulate logging activities within their claimed territories. I argue that the governmental project advanced by these communities is interwoven in a dialectical relationship between authoritative claims formulated through State evocations and the contingency of everyday affects. While any form of regulation ultimately depends on the uncoordinated actions and partial agreements achieved among indigenous dwellers, such regulations continuously produce innovative ways of interpreting the State\xe2\x80\x99s forms of authority and experimenting (with) liberal democratic institutions. I show how different forms of biopolitical production take place in this process, and how this alternative governmental project is not reducible to either State\xe2\x80\x99s forms of authority or to the commonalities of affective immaterial labour. Rather, I seek to draw attention on the ways in which State authority is evoked, appropriated, transformed and disputed in the contingent flow of life in common in Ampiyacu basin.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests have long been of interest to biologists because of their high species diversity and their complicated patterns of community organization. The traditional notion of the rain forest as an ancient, unvarying archive of species has been challenged by a host of recent ecological studies which have demonstrated that tropical trees are diverse in their reproductive biology and dynamic in their population structure.'

Abstract: 'Participation has been widely touted as \xe2\x80\x9cthe answer\xe2\x80\x9d to a number of problems facing sustainable development programs. It is not enough, however, to involve rural people as workers and informants in research and planning endeavors defined by outsiders. A truly collaborative approach will depend upon our ability to broaden our definitions of research and participation, to accommodate a wide spectrum of land users and local knowledge, and to expand our repertoire of research methods. This paper presents a critique of facile approaches to participation, outlines a more inclusive framework for who participates on what terms, and reviews a variety of methods that address the complex realities of rural livelihoods and landscapes. The final section of the paper suggests a multi-institutional model that combines the complementary strengths of several types of organizations in participatory field research and planning.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the responses of tropical trees to increasing [CO2] and climate change is important as tropical forests play an important role in carbon and hydrological cycles. We used stable carbon isotopes (\xce\xb413C) in tree rings to study the physiological responses of a tropical dry forest tree species in southern Mexico, Mimosa acantholoba to changes in atmospheric [CO2] and variation in climate. Based on annual records of tree ring \xce\xb413C, we calculated intrinsic water use efficiency (W i) and intercellular [CO2] (c i). Our results showed that trees responded strongly to the increase in atmospheric [CO2] over the last four decades; W i increased dramatically by 40%, while c i remained largely constant. The maintenance of a constant c i indicates that photosynthetic rates are unlikely to have increased in response to higher [CO2], and that improvements in W i are probably due to a reduction in stomatal conductance. This may have large consequences for the hydrological cycle. Inter-annual variation in c i was strongly correlated with total annual rainfall (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.70), and not influenced by temperature, solar radiation or cloud cover. Our results show that \xce\xb413C in tree rings of tropical dry forest trees may be a powerful tool to evaluate long-term responses of trees to increasing [CO2] and to variation in climate.'

Abstract: "\xe2\x80\x98Greening\xe2\x80\x99 the economy requires the creation of new markets in ecological goods and services, and there exist today many different payment mechanisms that differ significantly in terms of their distributional outcomes. Laura Rival compares three case studies: a forest conservation scheme involving payments for ecosystem services (PES) in the state of Amazonas, Brazil; Ecuador's government-led PES aimed at avoiding carbon dioxide emissions by keeping oil in the ground; and a ten-year grassroots project in the state of Minas Geiras, Brazil, which combats social exclusion with the dissemination of agroecological practices among poor small-scale farmers to provide viable economic alternatives to out-migration. The three programmes result from the efforts of social actors who have sought to create innovative sustainability-enhancing institutions in order to achieve environmental and social policy integration."

Abstract: 'Although levels of biological diversity may seem to be equivalent in different areas, diversity is created and maintained by a range of different ]processes: overlap of habitat on gradients; a dynamic mosaic of communities; and accumulation and evolution of taxa in extremely stable areas. These different communities will respond in very different ways to disturbance. The most fragile are those whose component taxa are genetically adapted to the stability of a predictable environment. These areas are often under pressure from local rural populations and require intensive local conservation management actions. In other areas, where diversity is adapted to dynamism, communities are more resilient to disturbance and conservation can be best effected by policy instruments.'

Abstract: 'Harvesting different species as foods or raw materials calls for differing skills depending on the species being harvested and the circumstances under which they are being taken. In some situations and for some species, the tactics used are mainly behavioral\xe2\x80\x94that is, people adjust, or adapt, their own actions to fit the behavior and circumstances of the species they are taking. Under other circumstances and for other species, the skills and tactics used may call for greater environmental preparation or manipulation. Therefore, instead of trying to distinguish people today and in the past as either \xe2\x80\x9cforagers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfarmers,\xe2\x80\x9d it makes sense to define human subsistence behavior as an interactive matrix of species and harvesting tactics, that is, as a provisions spreadsheet.'

Abstract: 'Although there are different results from different studies, most assessments indicate that climate variability would have negative effects on agriculture and forestry in the humid and sub-humid tropics. Cereal crop yields would decrease generally with even minimal increases in temperature. For commercial crops, extreme events such as cyclones, droughts and floods lead to larger damages than only changes of mean climate. Impacts of climate variability on livestock mainly include two aspects; impacts on animals such as increase of heat and disease stress-related death, and impacts on pasture. As to forestry, climate variability would have negative as well as some positive impacts on forests of humid and sub-humid tropics. However, in most tropical regions, the impacts of human activities such as deforestation will be more important than climate variability and climate change in determining natural forest cover.'

Abstract: 'Identifying appropriate temporal and spatial boundaries for assessments of human\xe2\x80\x93environment systems continues to be a challenge in sustainability science. The livelihood of Indigenous peoples in the northwestern Brazilian Amazon are characterized by complex ecological management systems entwined with sociocultural practices and sophisticated astronomical and ecological calendars. Sustainability of fisheries and bitter manioc production, key elements of food systems and economic activities in this region, depend on cyclic high river levels for fish spawning as well as periods of dry days for preparation of agricultural fields. Since 2005, participatory research has been underway between Indigenous communities of the Tiqui\xc3\xa9 River and the Brazilian Socio-environmental Institute (ISA). Indigenous agents of environmental management (AIMAs) keep notebooks of ethno-astronomical, ecological, and socio-economic observations of the annual cycles, and some of them have reported that river levels and dry periods have become more irregular in some years. To investigate how these possible climatic changes may impact the sustainability of resources, we share knowledge from the Tukano ecological calendar with methodology for examining changes in precipitation and river levels and their interactions at multiple timescales. Our collaboration indicates that high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation patterns and river levels may complicate climate change and sustainability analyses. However, combining results from participatory research with novel methods for climate analysis helps identify a 4-day trend in precipitation that may impact agroecosystem management. Indigenous participation in systematic data collection and interpretation of results is essential for distinguishing between socio-economic and climate forcings and evaluating climate impacts. Continued efforts to bridge Indigenous and Western knowledge systems are vital for sustainable environmental management in Indigenous territories and other regions where traditional management may be challenged in the context of global climate change.'

Abstract: 'This study investigated the relationship between environmental factors and the spatial and seasonal variations in the species richness and abundance of ferns and lycophytes in four gallery forests in the Cerrado savanna biome of central Brazil. The species composition, diversity, and similarity of the assemblages were analyzed, along with the influence of environmental factors on the spatial\xe2\x80\x93seasonal variation found in these parameters. A total of 72 species was recorded. Species richness was affected by the rockiness of the substrate in both the rainy and dry seasons. Abundance was affected by the presence of bamboos and Marantaceae in both seasons. Many species occurred in plots with reduced exposure to sunlight, and plots with the highest soil humidity had the highest species richness, including species found only in these plots. The seasonal variation in species richness and abundance was related primarily to the reduction in humidity during the dry season. Two highly similar groups were detected. For the first group, the factors that most influenced species richness (rockiness in the soil) and abundance (presence of bamboos and Marantaceae) are also related to the greater environmental heterogeneity of the streams. On the other hand, in the second group the highest levels of similarity in species composition were related to the environmental homogeneity of the streams.'

Abstract: 'From March 2007 to March 2009 we quantified plant diversity at Chilapatta Reserve Forest in Terai Duars in the Indian eastern Himalayas. We sampled stratified random nested quadrats. Species richness was 311, representing 167 genera and 81 families. The species diversity index and concentration of dominance of the forest were 2.20 and 0.0072, respectively. Shannon-Wiener index and evenness indices were 4.77 and 1.44, respectively. The Importance Value Index (IVI) of species ranged from 0.13 to 37.94. The estimated diversity indices indicated heterogeneity of the forest in its composition, structure, function and dynamics. Rich forest plant diversity supports the need for continued conservation of tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of fire in insular Southeast Asia from July 1996 to December 2001 using a set of consistent, nighttime fire observations provided by the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) sensor. Monthly ATSR fire counts were analyzed relative to georeferenced climatic and land-cover data from a variety of sources. We found that fires were strongly correlated with Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (r = \xe2\x88\x920.75) and Ni\xc3\xb1o 3.4 index (r = 0.72) in forested land-cover types within the equatorial belt (5.5\xe2\x88\x98S\xe2\x80\x935.5\xe2\x88\x98N). Cross-correlation analysis revealed that detrended SOI was modestly correlated (r = 0.42) with detrended monthly fire count with a positive lag of four months. However, our analysis also revealed that fire counts reached their maximum 6 months before the absolute maximum of SOI. Annual sums of SOI (\xe2\x88\x91SOI) and fire counts revealed linearity for \xe2\x88\x91SOI\xe2\x89\xa4 0. Overall, the results suggest that ENSO indices may have limited predictive utility at a monthly time scale, but that temporal aggregation and additional fire observations may enhance our capacity to forecast fires in different cover types based on ENSO data.'

Abstract: 'The Cerrado is Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s tropical savannah, which is arguably under greater threat than the Amazon rainforest.

Amblyomma cajennense was the first and Amblyomma parvum the second host-seeking tick species found. Only two other tick species were found free-living: one Amblyomma nodosum and three Amblyomma naponense nymphs. Cattle were infested with Boophilus microplus and A. cajennense. Buffalos were infested with B. microplus and A. parvum. Dogs were infested with A. cajennense, Amblyomma ovale, A. parvum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Anocentor nitens, B. microplus, A. cajennense, and A. parvum were found on horses. Amblyomma auricularium were found attached to nine-banded armadillos and Amblyomma rotundatum to red-footed tortoise, cururu toads and a rattlesnake. The latter was also infested with an adult A. cajennense. No tick was found on a goat, a tropical rat snake and a yellow armadillo. Among the observations the infestation of several domestic animals with A. parvum seems be the main feature. It suggests that this species might become a pest. However, the life cycle of A. parvum in nature, as well as its disease vectoring capacity, are largely unknown. It would be important to determine if it is a species expanding its geographic range by adaptation to new hosts or if it has been maintained in high numbers at definite locations by specific and still undetermined conditions. A higher prevalence of A. cajennense in most Brazilian biomes, with the exception of rainforests, was already shown before. Thus this species is favored by deforestation and is an important research target as it is the most common vector associated with the Brazilian spotted fever.'

Abstract: 'Root biomass was measured in the soil and canopy of a tropical montane forest in Costa Rica. Below-ground total root biomass in the soil of this forest ranged from 1600 g m\xe2\x88\x922 to 7200 g m\xe2\x88\x922 and biomass of fine roots (<2 mm diam.) ranged from 300 g m\xe2\x88\x922 to 1300 g m\xe2\x88\x922, depending on slope position. A root mat was present on the forest floor which contained 50 to 70% of the below-ground fine root biomass. A similar estimate was obtained for fine root biomass in the forest floor (H+A1 horizons) using both soil cores (10 cm diam. n=15) and excavated soil pits (1 m\xe2\x88\x922, n=4). About 5% of the below-ground fine roots and 13% of the below-ground total root biomass resided in the B2 horizon, which extended from 85 to 185 cm below the forest floor surface.'

Abstract: 'Due to long-term weathering of land surfaces, aeolian nutrient contributions can become essential to maintain ecosystem fertility and avoid retrogression. However, studies that consider the qualitative and quantitative effects of dust deposition on ecosystem development are rare. We addressed this knowledge gap by studying an active Holocene dust flux gradient along a 6,500\xc2\xa0year old dune ridge and a nearby chronosequence outside the influence of dust deposition in a super-humid, high leaching environment, on the west coast of the South Island in New Zealand.'

Abstract: "Little of Brazil's remaining Atlantic forest is protected, so it is important to assess how well the region's wildlife can persist in areas/habitats outside reserves. We studied bird diversity and abundance during 546 point counts in the Sooretama/Linhares reserve, 200 point counts in 31 forest fragments (10\xe2\x80\x93150 h), and 50 point counts in <30-year-old Eucalyptus plantations, within 7 km of the reserve. Only eight bird species were recorded in Eucalyptus, and this impoverishment, as compared to some Eucalyptus plantations elsewhere in Brazil may be a result of intensive clearance of understory vegetation. Species diversity in forest fragments was significantly lower than in the reserve. Twelve, mostly non-forest or edge species, were significantly commoner in the fragments, but nineteen species were frequent in the reserve but rare or absent in forest fragments. These included two Pyrrhura parakeets, a Brotogeris parakeet, a trogon Trogon, a jacamar Galbula, woodpeckers Piculus and Campephilus, Myrmotherula antwrens, and Hemithraupus and Tachyphonus tanagers. Bird species richness at points in forest fragments did not decline with fragment size, distance from the reserve, or forest quality. However, forest in fragments was more heavily degraded than forest within the reserve and poor forest quality may be the cause of declines in some species. Whilst protection of forest within reserves is a priority, management of forest fragments may aid conservation of some threatened species."

Abstract: 'Future global emissions of aerosols will play an important role in governing the nature and magnitude of future anthropogenic climate change. We present in this paper a number of future scenarios of emissions of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) by world region, which we combine with sulfate (SO4) assessed in terms of the emissions of its precursor, SO2. We find that aerosol emissions from the household and industrial sectors are likely to decline along almost all future pathways. Transportation emissions, however, are subject to complex interacting forces that can lead to either increases or decreases. Biomass burning declines in many scenarios, but the Amazon rainforests remain vulnerable if unsustainable economic growth persists. East Asia is the key region for primary aerosols, and trends in China will have a major bearing on the direction and magnitude of releases of BC (expected reductions in the range of 640\xe2\x80\x931290 Gg), OC (reductions of 520\xe2\x80\x931900 Gg), and SO2 (ranging from an increase of 21 Tg to a reduction of 30 Tg). Analysis of joint BC, OC, and SO2 emission changes identifies a number of key world regions and economic sectors that could be effectively targeted for aerosol reductions.'

Abstract: "This paper reviews the floristic composition, vegetation structure, and diversity of three types of swamp forest that cover a considerable part of Guyana's North-West District. Trees, shrubs, lianas, herbs, and hemi-epiphytes were inventoried in three hectare plots: one in Mora forest, one in quackal swamp, and one in manicole swamp. The Mora forest, flooded annually by white water, was dominated by relatively few, large individuals of Mora excelsa. The very dense, thin-stemmed quackal forest, almost permanently flooded by black water, was characterized by Tabebuia insignis and Symphonia globulifera and contained few palms. The somewhat less dense manicole swamp, flooded regularly by brackish water, was distinguished by large numbers of Euterpe oleracea. Although the three swamps showed little overlap in floristic composition and densities of dominant species, they represent some of the lowest diversity forest in the Neotropics, with an \xce\xb1-diversity of 7.4 for the Mora forest, 8.2 for the quackal forest and 5.7 for the manicole swamp. When compared with similar vegetation types in the Guiana Shield, the swamp forests in this study show some interesting differences in species composition and density. The wetlands of the North-West District form the last stretch of natural coastline in Guyana and play an important role in the protection of riverine ecosystems. Furthermore, there is commercial potential for the extraction of non-timber forest products from these low-diversity forests. Nevertheless, in prolonged dry periods, large tracts of quackal forest are being burnt to give way to almost treeless, flooded savannas. For these reasons, adequate management and conservation strategies must be developed for the area."

Abstract: 'Current ex situ collections of the wild rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis were gathered more than 25\xc2\xa0years ago mainly from populations in Southwest Amazonia. Information regarding the structure of genetic diversity among these populations is fragmented and needs refinement. Having analyzed polymorphisms at 15 microsatellites loci throughout the Hevea genome, we report on the genetic diversity of 307 clonally propagated individuals from 19 different collection points. All analyzed loci were highly polymorphic, averaging 21.7 alleles per locus, and displayed heterozygote deficiency. Differentiation among populations was analyzed on a subsample of 220 individuals from 14 populations. The overall F ST is 0.12; although low, this value is significant and suggests moderate differentiation. Mato Grosso (Brazil) populations were genetically more distant from all other populations. A highly significant correlation between genetic and geographical distances over the whole area under study was shown by the Mantel test. The Bayesian algorithm used by STRUCTURE software allowed for the identification of three population clusters that match the boundaries of hydrographical basins of the main Amazon River tributaries. Differentiation among populations could therefore be jointly explained by both geographical location within the hydrographical Amazon network and by isolation by distance among populations belonging to distinct catchments. It is likely that some of these populations no longer exist due to severe deforestation. We provide suggestions to improve genetic resource management and sampling strategy in natural populations of H. brasiliensis.'

Abstract: 'This article examines the main impacts of the illegal logging activities with emphasis on the most important timber production regions. Although the discussion is focused on the environmental, socio-economic and governance impacts, it must be stressed that the term forest governance is the umbrella where the economy, the environmental values, and welfare of forest-dependent communities are sheltered. Considering the effects/impacts of the illegal logging as a whole, we can summarize the following negative key points: (1) Degradation of the most valuable forest stands threatening biodiversity, including rare and endangered species. (2) Increase in soil erosion and landslides. Increase in CO2 release and climatic changes. (3) Human rights abuses and disrespect of the basic needs of local communities and their culture. (4) Corruption, crime, coercion, and money laundering. (5) Reduction of royalties, taxes, and other charges paid by logging companies to the producer States. (6) Depreciation of legal activities due to the unfair concurrence. Despite multiple efforts, the results in the combat of illegal logging are far from satisfactory. Increase the certification area in parallel with an accurate control, devolve the state land to the ancient local owners, increase the cooperation between civil society and forest authorities, and finally strongly improve forest governance, particularly anti-money laundering laws, are crucial aspects in the combat of illegal logging. Furthermore, governments and businesses must implement the triple bottom line concept in order to reach sustainability.'

Abstract: 'Climate changes occurring during the past several decades in the high elevations of the tropical Andes Mountains have implications for the native plant and animal species, for the ecological integrity of the affected land cover, and for the human-biophysical systems involved. Consequences are also probable for rural inhabitants and their livelihoods, especially for farmers and pastoralists. Biophysical factors have always changed in these mountainous zones; the extent and degree of alteration acting on native and agricultural biodiversity is the concern. Addressing these climate changes is probably within the adaptive capacity of many local land-use systems, unless external socioeconomic or political forces are unsupportive or antagonistic. Suitable programs to provide information, subsidies, or alternatives could be designed. We highlight some of the inherent resiliencies of natural and cultural systems in the Andes and suggest that these systems contain lessons that could be useful elsewhere, in terms of the traits that allow for the sustainable utilization of dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes.'

Abstract: 'There is a widespread belief that we are experiencing a mass extinction event similar in severity to previous mass extinction events in the last 600 million years where up to 95% of species disappeared. This paper reviews evidence for current extinctions and different methods of assessing extinction rates including species\xe2\x80\x93area relationships and loss of tropical forests, changing threat status of species, co-extinction rates and modelling the impact of climate change. For 30\xc2\xa0years some have suggested that extinctions through tropical forest loss are occurring at a rate of up to 100 species a day and yet less than 1,200 extinctions have been recorded in the last 400\xc2\xa0years. Reasons for low number of identified global extinctions are suggested here and include success in protecting many endangered species, poor monitoring of most of the rest of species and their level of threat, extinction debt where forests have been lost but species still survive, that regrowth forests may be important in retaining \xe2\x80\x98old growth\xe2\x80\x99 species, fewer co-extinctions of species than expected, and large differences in the vulnerability of different taxa to extinction threats. More recently, others have suggested similar rates of extinction to earlier estimates but with the key cause of extinction being climate change, and in particular rising temperatures, rather than deforestation alone. Here I suggest that climate change, rather than deforestation is likely to bring about such high levels of extinction since the impacts of climate change are local to global and that climate change is acting synergistically with a range of other threats to biodiversity including deforestation.'

Abstract: 'This study investigated links between seed production by two species of Miconia (Melastomataceae), whose seeds are dispersed by birds, and later stages of recruitment in lowland forests of eastern Ecuador. Seed dispersal and survival in later stages are crucial for understanding and predicting patterns of plant population dynamics as well as for understanding patterns of diversity in tropical forests. A major goal was to determine if the spatial template of seed deposition established by birds predicted probability of recruitment. We used observational and experimental approaches to compare patterns of recruitment in Miconia fosteri and M. serrulata. We calculated probabilities of transition between successive stages of recruitment for each species in three habitats. The number of plants with fruit, number of fruits removed, and, to a lesser extent, patterns of seed deposition varied between species and among habitats, whereas seed survival, germination, and establishment showed little variation among habitats. The location of seed deposition directly influenced the cumulative probabilities of survival. Among-habitat differences in the probabilities of recruitment set by seed deposition were not modified by later stages, although probability of recruitment was 2.5 times higher for M. serrulata than for M. fosteri after 1\xc2\xa0year. The more critical stages for recruitment were seed removal and deposition. Our results from multiple life-cycle stages suggest that habitat associations among plants that reach reproductive maturity become established at early life stages and were mostly a consequence of seed dispersal by birds. These results differ from those obtained in temperate zones and suggest fundamental differences in the importance of recruitment processes. Dispersers, such as manakins, play significant roles in recruitment and population dynamics of M. fosteri, M. serrulata and numerous other understory plants of Neotropical forests. Their role in plant recruitment could be much greater than previously considered in megadiverse tropical forests. Thus, loss of dispersers could have long-term and far-reaching implications for maintenance of diversity.'

Abstract: "Transdisciplinary thinking is an emerging philosophy underpinning health social science. We advance a definition of transdisciplinary thinking and link it with complexity theory. Complexity theory's concern with non-linear relationships, interactive causality and emergent properties of systems compels researchers to adopt a transdisciplinary perspective. We construct a generic framework for analyzing health processes from diverse disciplines and apply it to coronary heart disease in the Australian Coalfields. Insights from this analysis support our argument that transdisciplinary thinking maximizes understanding of the complexity of human health."

Abstract: 'A broad regional understanding of tropical forest leaf photosynthesis has long been a goal for tropical forest ecologists, but it has remained elusive due to difficult canopy access and high species diversity. Here we develop an empirical model to predict sunlit, light-saturated, tropical leaf photosynthesis using leaf and simulated canopy spectra. To develop this model, we used partial least squares (PLS) analysis on three tropical forest datasets (159 species), two in Hawaii and one at the biosphere 2 laboratory (B2L). For each species, we measured light-saturated photosynthesis (A), light and CO2 saturated photosynthesis (A max), respiration (R), leaf transmittance and reflectance spectra (400\xe2\x80\x932,500\xc2\xa0nm), leaf nitrogen, chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, and leaf mass per area (LMA). The model best predicted A [r  2 \xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.74, root mean square error (RMSE)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02.9\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921)] followed by R (r  2 \xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.48), and A max (r  2 \xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.47). We combined leaf reflectance and transmittance with a canopy radiative transfer model to simulate top-of-canopy reflectance and found that canopy spectra are a better predictor of A (RMSE\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.07\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921) than are leaf spectra. The results indicate the potential for this technique to be used with high-fidelity imaging spectrometers to remotely sense tropical forest canopy photosynthesis.'

Abstract: 'A potential impact of climate change in the south Asian context in general and the Indian subcontinent in particular is an increase in rainfall, in some areas up to 50%. Using an extensive information base available on the dynamics of landscape structure and function of the northeastern hill areas of India, scenarios on landscape changes, as an adaptation to climate change, have been constructed. Climate change would impose a variety of stresses on sustainable livelihood of the inhabitants of the rain-forested areas through stresses on ecosystem function. It is concluded that appropriate management strategies for natural forests and plantation forestry should go hand in hand with a comprehensive rural ecosystem rehabilitation plan.'

Abstract: 'In this study, the concentrations of 16 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH), considered priority by US EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency), in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), were determined in a forest reserve and in an urban area in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The PM2.5 samples were collected in the Tijuca Forest (TF) and on the Maracan\xc3\xa3 campus of the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), using PM2.5 high-volume air samplers, from November 2015 to April 2016. The organic matter was extracted, separated by liquid chromatography, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The mean total PAH (excluding naphthalene, acenaphthene, and acenaphthylene) concentrations were 0.46\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.61\xc2\xa0ng\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x923 and 1.12\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.71\xc2\xa0ng\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x923 in PM2.5 collected at TF and UERJ, respectively. The diagnostic ratios suggested vehicular sources for both sites with no clear distinction between light and heavy vehicular sources. Cluster and principal component analyses were also used to clarify the possible PAH sources. Simulations of air mass trajectories confirmed the transport of pollutants from the city to the forest. Mutagenicity tests revealed that the PM collected in the UERJ presented mutagenic positive activity, likely for nitro-PAH and amino-PAH, which may be related to vehicular emissions. For the TF, although the forest was impacted by the pollutants, no positive activity was detected. Correlation and cluster analyses showed different PAH distributions for the TF and UERJ sites, which indicates that the TF receives the air masses from the city but is also impacted by local emissions.'

Abstract: ' The arboreal ant fauna was investigated in Budongo Forest, a seasonal rain forest in Uganda, using the insecticidal fogging technique. Ants were collected from 61 trees, between 7 and 33\xc2\xa0m in height, belonging to four tree species. Trees were growing in adjacent plots of forests characterized by different use and structure: an old primary forest, a primary swamp forest along a small river, and a secondary forest where selective logging was carried out for 30\xc2\xa0years. A total number of 37,065 ants, belonging to 161 species in 30 genera were collected. Considering the high number of species found only once, the completeness of the canopy ant fauna was relatively high and of relatively similar magnitude as samples from the Neotropics or the Oriental region. Up to 37 ant species on a single tree, with an average of 18.2\xc2\xa0species per tree, were found. Forty-four ant species (28.1%) were found only once, less than ten individuals were found for each of 88 species (54.7%), but 64.0% of all individuals belonged to one of five species. Considering the high numerical dominance of a few ant species like a Pheidole sp., Tetramoriumaculeatum (Mayr) and a Crematogaster sp., there is some evidence for an ant mosaic in the lower canopy of the Budongo Forest. Individual numbers of ants were strongly correlated with nests in the fogged tree, though the ants were not homogeneously distributed in the tree crowns. Diversity measures that strongly depend on individual numbers such as the Morisita-Horn index or rarefaction methods were calculated, but results were not concordant with those of incidence-based estimates such as jack-knife calculations. Differences in ant species richness and faunal composition between tree species were low, but more significant between forest types. The ant fauna in the secondary forest was less diverse with 12.6% fewer species compared to the primary forest sites. The average number of ant species per tree was significantly lower in the secondary forest (<20% of the species; F=8.03, df=59, P<0.01) than in the undisturbed forest types. Cataulacus, Leptothorax, Tetraponera, and Polyrhachis, which are typical canopy-dwelling ant genera, had a significantly higher diversity and frequency in the two primary forest types (F=4.17, df=53, P<0.05). Secondary forest trees are often younger, lacking dead branches and epiphytes which are important requisites for ant colonization on trees.'

Abstract: 'The pollen and charcoal record of a 1,500-cm-long lake sediment core from Lagoa Nova allows a reconstruction of vegetation, climate and fire history in the Atlantic lowland of southeastern Brazil. Today the potential vegetation of the study region would be dense and tall semi-deciduous forest, related to a dry season of 4\xc2\xa0months and 1,250\xc2\xa0mm precipitation per year. The lowermost core section of Lagoa Nova is probably of late Glacial age and contains only few, poorly preserved pollen grains, indicating dry environmental conditions. Pollen preservation was good above 1,005-cm core depth. Extrapolating from four radiocarbon dates, this interval represents about the last 10,000\xc2\xa0years. During the early Holocene (until about 8,500\xc2\xa0b.p.), the landscape was dominated by savanna of the campo cerrado type (open shrub woodland), with frequent trees of Curatella americana and small areas of gallery forests along the drainage system. Savanna fires, probably natural, were frequent at that time. The palaeovegetation pattern is consistent with a long dry season of about 6\xc2\xa0months and annual precipitation lower than today. Then, up to about 7,560\xc2\xa0b.p., gallery forests expanded in the valleys, reflecting a shorter dry season of about 5\xc2\xa0months and somewhat higher annual rainfall. Fire was less frequent during this wetter period. Between about 7,560 and 6,060\xc2\xa0b.p., savanna expanded and gallery forests retreated, indicating a return to drier climatic conditions of probably between 5 and 6\xc2\xa0months dry season and lower precipitation. Fire was again frequent, but not as frequent as during the early Holocene. During the mid to late Holocene period between about 6,060 and 2,180\xc2\xa0b.p., the valleys were covered by semi-deciduous forest, but on the hills cerrado vegetation continued to grow. The dry season was probably around 5\xc2\xa0months and rainfall was higher than in the preceding period. During the following period between about 2,810 and 600\xc2\xa0b.p., the open cerrado on the hills changed to closed cerrado, reflecting wetter conditions with a shorter dry season than in the previous period. It was only after about 600\xc2\xa0b.p. that dense semi-deciduous forests expanded throughout the study region, indicating the start of modern, wet climatic conditions with an annual dry season of about 4\xc2\xa0months. Fire was nearly absent during this period. The reconstructed palaeoenvironment from the Lagoa Nova record is similar to that of Lago do Pires, indicating that changes in past vegetation, climate and fire frequency are regionally consistent in southeastern Brazil.'

Abstract: ' The acetylene reduction method was used to measure nitrogen fixation in the phyllosphere of attached leaves of different phorophytes under natural conditions in a premontane rain forest in Costa Rica. Maximum rates of nitrogen fixation (26\xe2\x80\x89ng\xe2\x80\x89N\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\x89cm\xe2\x88\x922 leaf area\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\x89h\xe2\x88\x921) \xe2\x80\x93 mainly due to the activity of two species of Scytonema (Cyanobacteria) \xe2\x80\x93 were measured in the rainy season in bright sunlight. Rates of nitrogen fixation were correlated with the leaf area covered by Scytonema. In periods without precipitation the fixation activity decreased to zero within 2\xe2\x80\x933 days. As long as the epiphylls were sufficiently supplied with water, other microclimatic factors like temperature and light intensity also influenced nitrogen fixation rates, but to a lesser extent. Relative humidity and species of phorophyte showed no direct influence. It was concluded that the most important factor for nitrogen fixation in the phyllosphere was the availability of liquid water. Linking these results to meteorological data, the input of nitrogen by biological nitrogen fixation in the phyllosphere in the investigation area was estimated to be as much as 1.6\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.8\xe2\x80\x89kg\xe2\x80\x89N\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb7 ha\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921  per unit of leaf area index (LAI).

This work also demonstrates the importance of detailed knowledge of variation in microclimate throughout the year as a basis for extrapolation of the annual nitrogen input.'

Abstract: 'Results of recent ethnographic research in indigenous agricultural systems in the South American tropical forests indicate that the Geertzian model of the highly intercropped swidden that mimics the tropical forest it replaces is not the appropriate description of the agricultural regimes of several rainforest peoples. A model is proposed relating degree of intercropping to amount of agricultural labor.'

Abstract: 'The size class distribution in tree populations will continue to be used for analysing the regeneration of tree species and successional patterns in forest communities at extensive levels. However, information regarding the approximate estimates of lifetime expectancy (residence time) for each of the size classes, viz seedlings, saplings and trees, and the estimates of rate of net gain for them (population divided by residence time) can considerably enhance our understanding of the regeneration trends of species. It is shown that several population structures, based on size class distribution may indicate declining population trend, although the population, as indicated by rate of net gain parameter, in fact may foretell future expansion or stability. It appears that high species richness and high percentages of species with poor regeneration are interrelated with each other.'

Abstract: 'The Quilombola communities of Ipiranga and Gurugi, located in Atlantic Rainforest in Southern of Para\xc3\xadba state, have stories that are interwoven throughout time. The practice of meliponicultura has been carried out for generations in these social groups and provides an elaborate ecological knowledge based on native stingless bees, the melliferous flora and the management techniques used. The traditional knowledge that Quilombola have of stingless bees is of utmost importance for the establishment of conservation strategies for many species.'

Abstract: 'Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) is a dominant self-incompatible ant-plant or myrmecophyte, growing as an understorey tree in high-density patches. It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal, characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager\xe2\x80\x99s evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity index (0.1895) as well as of Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (0.1186). In each population, observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected, indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations, grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales. The clonality of H. brunonis may be a factor that contributes to its dominance in Western Ghat forests where it supports a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna.'

Abstract: "Interactions betweenGliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Steud., the crops maize and upland rice, and soil conditions were investigated in an alley cropping experiment on aFerralic Cambisol/Plinthic Lixisol in the rainforest area of the C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire. Conventional and mulched sole cropping treatments were included for comparison. Hedgerow integration significantly reduced N and Mg losses from the soil. These effects were neither observed in the mulched sole cropping treatment nor reduced by hedgerow root barriers, suggesting that they were not direct consequences of the input of hedgerow biomass into the soil. Crop yields were increased in the central part of the alleys as compared to sole cropping, but the effect was offset by the loss of cropped surface which was occupied by the hedgerows and by yield depressions at the tree-crop interface.Gliricidia mulch increased foliar nutrient concentrations of maize; however, unlike mineral fertilizer the mulch had no influence on the imbalance between low P and high K levels in maize leaves. Nutrient accumulation in the dry season vegetation tended to be higher in alley cropping than in sole cropping. Weeds were particularly efficient in accumulating those nutrients which were relatively low in the hedgerow biomass. Necessary improvements to the cropping system are discussed. The optimum composition of fertilizers in mulching systems deserves attention."

Abstract: 'Studies measuring the damage in degraded environments have increased, and it is necessary to obtain reliable biological and ecological indicators for the recovery of such degraded environments and subsequent preservation. This study aimed to conduct a survey of local insects and evaluate their utility in monitoring forest restoration in a degraded area in the Atlantic Forest biome in Ribeirao Grande, State of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, Brazil. Collections with Shuey traps were conducted from 2006 to 2011 in four distinct forest fragments characterized by environmental impacts, human actions, and phytophysiognomic profiles: Forest (FO), a preserved area with native plant species; \xe2\x80\x9cCapoeira\xe2\x80\x9d (CA), an area in the natural regeneration process; Planting (PL), an area reforested with native plants; and Pasture (PA), an area with only shrubs. A total of 2,456 specimens of Calliphoridae (Diptera) were collected. Mesembrinella bellardiana was the most abundant (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01,884) and dominant species in all environments sampled. The relative abundance of M. bellardiana in the most preserved environment (60.2\xc2\xa0% FO, 24.4\xc2\xa0% CA, 8.6\xc2\xa0% PL, and 6.7\xc2\xa0% PA) and other ecological parameters showed that it could be a bioindicator species, i.e., data on its presence or absence directly reflected the status of local preservation. Information on Neotropical dipterans associated with the forested environment is very scarce in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the occurrence of Calliphora lopesi (Calliphoridae) in the State of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo.'

Abstract: ' Hirsutella thompsonii (Fischer) (Ascomycota: Ophiocordycipitaceae), a fungal pathogen, often causes high mortality in populations of Calacarus heveae Feres (Acari: Eriophyidae), an important pest mite in rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg., Euphorbiaceae). However, the ecological and climatic factors regulating this host-pathogen system are poorly known. We compared fungal infections in agroforestry and traditional rubber plantations to evaluate the role of native vegetation and climatic factors on infection rates of C. heveae by H. thompsonii. While the prevalence of H. thompsonii was higher in managed rubber tree plantations, the abundance of C. heveae was about three times higher in traditional plantations. Abundance of C. heveae, agroecosystem management type and microclimatic variables were responsible for driving the infection rates of H. thompsonii. Native vegetation was a source for H. thompsonii and also modified the crop\xe2\x80\x99s microclimate, which contributed to its maintenance in the crop fields. Therefore, appropriate management practices may enhance the effects of entomopathogens on conservative biological control of pest mites in agroforestry systems.'

Abstract: "By applying principles of adaptive management, and by using the valuable information that arthropods provide from assessment and monitoring programs, managers can identify and reduce possible impacts on biodiversity in development projects. In 1996, the Smithsonian Institution's Monitoring and Assessment of Biodiversity program worked together with Shell Prospecting and Development Peru to establish an adaptive management program to protect biodiversity in a natural gas exploration project in a Peruvian rainforest. In this paper, we outlined the conceptual steps involved in establishing an assessment and monitoring program for arthropods, including setting objectives, evaluating the results and making decisions. We also present the results of the assessment using some of groups of arthropods, and summarize the steps taken to identify appropriate groups for monitoring."

Abstract: 'Research published in this special issue on cocoa agroforestry illustrates the multifunctional role of shade trees for sustaining cocoa production and improving farmers\xe2\x80\x99 livelihoods, and addresses tradeoffs between higher cocoa yield and the provision of ecosystem services to local households and global society. Indeed, the use of diverse shade in cocoa cultivation is threatened by a new drive towards crop intensification. The removal of shade trees diminishes smallholders\xe2\x80\x99 ability to adapt to global change driven by demographic pressure, food insecurity, cocoa price volatility and climate change. Some forms of crop intensification may reduce ecological resilience of cocoa production systems, making adaptation strategies, combining shade trees with innovative management practices, essential for sustaining cocoa yield. Managing trade-offs between yield and environmental services at the cocoa plot and landscape scales requires a multi-disciplinary approach to identify key management options that goes beyond the artificially polarized debates around intensified versus traditional agroforestry practices, or more generally, land-sparing versus land-sharing strategies. The global challenge facing the cocoa sector today is how to increase cocoa production to meet growing demand, without expanding the area under cocoa. This means finding sustainable ways to maintain cocoa production within today\xe2\x80\x99s producing regions, particularly West Africa, through a series of technical innovations geared towards smallholders. Inappropriate intensification may result in heavy deforestation on new pioneer fronts, such as the Congo basin, and existing cocoa being replaced either by other agricultural commodities, or by less resilient and less environmentally friendly production practices.'

Abstract: 'We studied the floristic composition and stand structure of lowland forests of the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) of El Pet\xc3\xa9n, Guatemala. Sampling was performed over a gradient of human influence, including a newly established returnee community (migrant), the cooperative Uni\xc3\xb3n Maya Itz\xc3\xa1, as well as an adjacent protected area within the core area of the MBR. Five 1-ha plots, each divided into 100 contiguous 10\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0m2 subplots, were used to record presence of all tree and vine species. The study area is a low-diversity rainforest with a canopy layer dominated by species of Fabaceae, a shrub layer dominated by Rubiaceae, and vines dominated by Bignoniaceae. Vines were conspicuous both in number and in diversity. Variation in both tree life-form composition and canopy abundance pattern apparently reflect variation in intensity of forestry among the plots. The similarities between the plots in the cooperative (a logging plot and a settlement plot) with regard to species area curves, and mean number of tree and understory species per subplot, may indicate effects of disturbance (in general) on vegetation structure. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to investigate gradients in species composition among the five plots (125 subplots) and to generate hypotheses about vegetation\xe2\x80\x93environment relationships. The study area appears as a mosaic of site-specific forest types or associations determined by a particular species or groups of co-dominant species. The main environmental characteristics of the area determining species composition and structure are related to the drainage of soils and human disturbance.'

Abstract: "The coffee (Coffea arabica) agro-ecosystem in the Central Valley of Costa Rica was formerly characterized by a high vegetational diversity. This complex system has been undergoing a major transformation to capital-intensive monocultural plantations where all shade trees are eliminated. In this study we examined the pattern of arthropod biodiversity loss associated with this transformation. Canopy arthropods were sampled in three coffee farms: a traditional plantation with many species of shade trees, a moderately shaded plantation with only Erythrina poeppigeana and coffee, and a coffee monoculture. An insecticidal fogging technique was used to sample both canopy and coffee arthropods. Data are presented on three major taxonomic groups: Coleoptera, non-formicid Hymenoptera, and Formicidae. Data demonstrate that the transformation of the coffee agro-ecosystem results in a significant loss of biological diversity of both canopy arthropods as well as arthropods living in coffee bushes. Percentage of species overlap was very small for all comparisons. Furthermore, species' richness on a per tree basis was found to be within the same order of magnitude as that reported for trees in tropical forests. If results presented here are generalizable, this means that conservation efforts to preserve biological diversity should also include traditional agro-ecosystems as conservation units."

Abstract: 'A taxonomic revision is presented of the Hydriastele wendlandiana group, a well-defined species grouping within the Indo-Pacific palm genus Hydriastele that occurs in New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and northern Australia. We accept five species: Hydriastele kasesa, H. rheophytica, H. variabilis, H. wendlandiana and H. apetiolata sp. nov. and provide fundamental information about each of those taxa including a summary of the group\xe2\x80\x99s taxonomic history and phylogeny, a distribution map, a key to the species, species descriptions with scientific illustrations, and IUCN Red List assessments.'

Abstract: 'The evaporation of deep crops such as forests is usually considered in terms of the two-resistance Penman-Monteith model, though this conflates two of the three resistances actually involved, i.e. the canopy resistancer c  between the transpiring leaves and the top of the canopy, and the resistancer s  due to the stomates of the leaves. A review of the literature on these and the aerodynamic resistancer a  (between the crop and the atmosphere) shows how distinctly different they are, and therefore how inappropriate it is to lump any two together.'

Abstract: 'In mildly seasonal tropical climates, the pattern of marks on hard body parts of fishes may be difficult to interpret and unreliable for age determination. Many tropical fishes are now known to have annual peaks in spawning activity which are reflected in their length-frequency distributions. Although scales from freshwater stream fishes in the Baram River system of Sarawak, Malaysia revealed no clearly discernable pattern of annual marks, age classes could be identified from the length-frequency histograms with sufficient accuracy for production to be calculated. For management of the numerous and relatively unknown species present in rapidly developing tropical fisheries, serial quantitative samples at the same localities and inter-locality comparisons of length-frequency histograms may offer a fast and effective method of establishing the necessary age structures.'

Abstract: 'We have investigated levels of genetic diversity within and among seven remnant populations of Caesalpinia echinata Lam., an endangered species found as fragmented populations in three major areas around the coastal regions of Brazil. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genetic markers, we detected levels of within-population genetic diversity ranging from 0.092 to 0.163, with the lowest values generally being found in the smallest populations. Estimates of between-population genetic differentiation were strongly correlated with geographical distance (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.884, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001), which,along with a neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis, strongly suggested high levels of genetic isolation by distance. Over half (62%) of the total genetic diversity was partitioned between populations, further highlighting the genetic distinctness of individual populations. Taken together, these results suggest that fragmentation has led to an increase in population differentiation between fragments of C. echinata. These formations will be of great value in the development of conservation plans for species exhibiting high levels of genetic differentiation due to fragmentation, such as indication of conservation unit size, which populations should be chosen as priority in conservation plans and which samples should be introduced in areas with a low number of individuals of brazilwood.'

Abstract: 'The effects of selective logging and other types of forest exploitation on bird communities are often studied latitudinally, i.e. a contemporaneous comparison of disturbed and pristine areas. Such an approach assumes that before disturbance those areas were equivalent. By comparing communities at a single site before and after disturbance, a so called longitudinal approach does not make that assumption but such studies can be resource intensive. In this study we adopt a latitudinal approach to explore the effects of disturbance on birds, but pay specific attention to whether natural geographically-based variation in the forest ecosystem may be a major contributory factor equal to, or greater than, effects of disturbance. Bird census data were collected from two Indonesian islands, Sumba and Buru. On Sumba the differences between habitat types in terms of species richness, species accumulation rates, and numbers of birds were swamped by simple site differences between the forest blocks sampled. On Buru, disturbed areas were more diverse than mature forest but it was still not possible to discount the effects of natural variation between forest areas. Although the islands support bird faunas which are rather similar in size and origin, local species diversities and abundances were significantly greater on Sumba. Substituting space for time is a common strategy in ecological research but the results of such studies should be viewed with caution.'

Abstract: 'Whole colonies of the arboreal termite Nasutitermes corniger (lsoptera, Termitidae, Nasutitermitinae) from a Costa Rican rainforest were assayed for nitrogen fixation by the acetylene reduction method, using a 21-1 test chamber. Nitrogenase activity was positively correlated with termite biomass for the nexts examined, providing the experiment was performed within 2 h of removal of the colony from the field. Total colony fixation rates of 0.25\xe2\x80\x931.0 mg N per colony per hour indicate a nitrogen doubling time of 200\xe2\x80\x93600 days, thereby making possible complete replacement of the nest population 1\xe2\x80\x932 times per year.'

Abstract: ' Disturbance events vary in intensity, size, and frequency, but few opportunities exist to study those that are extreme on more than one of these gradients. This article characterizes successional processes that occur following infrequent disturbance events that are exceptional in their great intensity or large size. The spatial variability in disturbance intensity within large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs) often leads to a heterogeneous pattern of surviving organisms. These surviving organisms dictate much of the initial successional pattern on large disturbances where the opportunities for seeds to disperse into the middle of the disturbance are limited. The traditional distinction between primary and secondary succession is insufficient to capture the tremendous variability in succession following LIDs. Disturbance size influences succession where long-distance colonization by propagules is important. Observations from LIDs suggest the following interrelated hypotheses about trends in succession with increasing distance from seed sources when disturbanceintensity is high: (a) initial densities of organisms will be lower; (b) nucleation processes, in which recovering patches serve as foci for additional colonization and expand spatially, will be more important; (c) competitive sorting will be less important relative to chance arrival in determination of community composition, and (d) community composition will be initially less predictable; and (e) the rate of recovery of community composition will be slower. Prediction of succession following LIDs without considering contingencies such as the abundance, types, and spatial distribution of residuals, and distance to seed sources is likely to be unsuccessful for large portions of the landscape. Abundance and spatial arrangement of survivors and arrival patterns of propagules may be the pivotal factors determining how succession differs between intense disturbances of large and small extent.'

Abstract: '\nThe sensitivity of evaporation to a prescribed vegetation annual cycle is examined globally in the Met Office Hadley Centre Unified Model (HadAM3) which incorporates the Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme (MOSES2) as the land surface scheme. A vegetation annual cycle for each plant functional type in each grid box is derived based on satellite estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI) obtained from the nine-year International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project II dataset. The prescribed model vegetation seasonality consists of annual cycles of a number of structural vegetation characteristics including LAI as well as canopy height, surface roughness, canopy water capacity, and canopy heat capacity, which themselves are based on empirical relationships with LAI. An annual cycle of surface albedo, which in the model is a function of soil albedo, surface soil moisture, and LAI, is also modelled and agrees reasonably with observed estimates of the surface albedo annual cycle. Two 25-year numerical experiments are completed and compared: the first with vegetation characteristics held at annual mean values, the second with prescribed realistic seasonally varying vegetation. Initial analysis uncovered an unrealistically weak relationship between evaporation and vegetation state that is primarily due to the insensitivity of evapotranspiration to LAI. This weak relationship is strengthened by the adjustment of two MOSES2 parameters that together improve the model\xe2\x80\x99s LAI-surface conductance relationship by comparison with observed and theoretical estimates. The extinction coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation, k  par , is adjusted downwards from 0.5 to 0.3, thereby enhancing the LAI-canopy conductance relationship. A canopy shading extinction coefficient, k  sh , that controls what fraction of the soil surface beneath a canopy is directly exposed to the overlying atmosphere is increased from 0.5 to 1.0, which effectively reduces soil evaporation under a dense canopy. When the experiments are repeated with the adjusted parameters, the relationship between evaporation and vegetation state is strengthened and is more spatially consistent. At nearly all locations, the annual cycle of evaporation is enhanced in the seasonally varying vegetation experiment. Evaporation is stronger during the peak of the growing season and, in the tropics, reduced transpiration during the dry season when LAI is small leads to significantly lower total evaporation.'

Abstract: 'Arturo Escobar examines the increasing number of conflicts over natural resources around the world in response to neo-liberal globalization. He argues that such escalating environmental conflicts can be conceptually understood through three inter-related rubrics: economic, ecological, and cultural. His interest is in the relationship between difference and equality of access in economic, ecological, and cultural distribution conflicts in order to set out a political ecology framework. He asks that we treat economic, ecological, and cultural distribution as equally important. If we are to live in a peaceful, just and balanced modern social world we can no longer deny people their rights to their own cultures, ecologies, and economies.'

Abstract: 'The N, P, and S cycles in pristine forests are assumed to differ from those of anthropogenically impacted areas, but there are only a few studies to support this. Our objective was therefore to assess the controls of N, P, and S release, immobilization, and transport in a remote tropical montane forest. The study forest is located on steep slopes of the northern Andes in Ecuador. We determined the concentrations of NO3-N, NH4-N, dissolved organic N (DON), PO4-P, dissolved organic P (DOP), SO4-S, dissolved organic S (DOS), and dissolved organic C (DOC) in rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, lateral flow (in the organic layer), litter leachate, mineral soil solution, and stream water of three 8\xe2\x80\x9313\xc2\xa0ha catchments (1900\xe2\x80\x932200\xc2\xa0m a.s.l.). The organic forms of N, P, and S contributed, on average, 55, 66, and 63% to the total N, P, and S concentrations in all ecosystem fluxes, respectively. The organic layer was the largest source of all N, P, and S species except for inorganic P and S. Most PO4 was released in the canopy by leaching and most SO4 in the mineral soil by weathering. The mineral soil was a sink for all studied compounds except for SO4. Consequently, concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic N and P were as low in stream water (TDN: 0.34\xe2\x80\x930.39\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921, P not detectable) as in rainfall (TDN: 0.39\xe2\x80\x930.48\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921, P not detectable), whereas total S concentrations were elevated (stream water: 0.04\xe2\x80\x930.15, rainfall: 0.01\xe2\x80\x930.07\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0S\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921). Dissolved N, P, and S forms were positively correlated with pH at the scale of soil peda except inorganic S. Soil drying and rewetting promoted the release of dissolved inorganic N. High discharge levels following heavy rainstorms were associated with increased DOC, DON, NO3-N and partly also NH4-N concentrations in stream water. Nitrate-N concentrations in the stream water were positively correlated with stream discharge during the wetter period of the year. Our results demonstrate that the sources and sinks of N, P, and S were element-specific. More than half of the cycling N, P, and S was organic. Soil pH and moisture were important controls of N, P, and S solubility at the scale of individual soil peda whereas the flow regime influenced the export with stream water.'

Abstract: 'Six islands, each less than a hectare in area, were isolated in about 1913 from the mainland of central Panam\xc3\xa1 by the rising waters of Gatun Lake. By 1980, the diversity of trees on all but one of these islands was far lower than on mainland plots of comparable size. A restricted subset of tree species has spread on these islands, notablyProtium panamense, Scheelea zonensis, Oenocarpus panamanus andSwartzia simplex. We constructed a null model to predict how chance would change tree diversity and the similarity of tree species compositions of different islands, assuming that each mature tree has equal chances of dying and/or reproducing, regardless of its species. This model cannot account for the diminished diversity of the changes in vegetation on these islands: some factors must be favoring a particular set of tree species.'

Abstract: 'By 2050, global livestock production is expected to double\xe2\x80\x94growing faster than any other agricultural sub-sector\xe2\x80\x94with most of this increase taking place in the developing world. As the United Nation\xe2\x80\x99s four-hundred-page report, Livestock\xe2\x80\x99s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, documents, livestock production is now one of three most significant contributors to environmental problems, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions, land degradation, water pollution, and increased health problems. The paper draws on the UN report as well as a flurry of other recently published studies in order to demonstrate the effect of intensive livestock production on global warming and on people\xe2\x80\x99s health. The paper\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to outline the problems caused by intensive livestock farming and analyze a number of possible solutions, including legislative changes and stricter regulations, community mobilizing, and consumers choosing to decrease their demand for animal products.'

Abstract: 'The method presented in here allows for the unequivocal differentiation between non-invasive samples of ocelots and margays, when used in combination with the protocol by Roques et al. (Mol Ecol Resour 11:171\xe2\x80\x93175, 2011). It reduced costs and laboratory processing, decreasing the chances of contamination, and therefore facilitating the identification of large numbers of samples by simple PCR amplification, without the need for sequencing. Our protocol was tested on 371 faeces collected in the field in 25 different sites across the distribution areas of both species, and compared to the mtDNA sequencing of 23 of the samples. The concatenation of a commonly used segment of Cytochrome b with other mitochondrial markers such as ATP-8 allows the identification of these two sister-species, but there was not enough resolution when used alone. With this new method, we could identify 98% of the field faeces, obtaining a global rate of 22.3 faeces of ocelot per margay sample in roads and trails located in potential areas of coexistence, suggesting generally lower densities of margay, although margays could be underestimated due to their arboreal habits. In Serra das Almas, located in the Brazilian Caatinga, the number of faeces of ocelot detected was especially elevated. Low densities of ocelots could be favoring higher densities of margays in areas like the Sinaloan dry forests and the Chimalapas montane forests, both in Mexico. Ocelots were found from open to forested habitats, including mosaic cropland and grassland, however margays were only found in forests where average canopy height exceeded 5\xc2\xa0m.'

Abstract: 'Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) infection is an ancient and widespread zoonosis distributed throughout the Americas. Ecologically, Brazil comprises several distinct biomes: Amazonia, Cerrado, Caatinga, Pantanal and the Atlantic Forest. Sylvatic T. cruzi transmission is known to occur throughout these biomes, with multiple hosts and vectors involved. Parasite species-level genetic diversity can be a useful marker for ecosystem health. Our aims were to: investigate sylvatic T. cruzi genetic diversity across different biomes, detect instances of genetic exchange, and explore the possible impact of ecological disturbance on parasite diversity at an intra-species level.'

Abstract: 'Soil CO2 evolution rates, soil temperatures and moisture were measured during the dry season in two forest-to-pasture chronosequences in Rond\xc3\xb4nia, Brazil. The study included pastures ranging from 3 to 80 years-old. Mean dry-season CO2 evolution from the forest in chronosequence 1, 88.8 mg CO2-C m\xe2\x88\x922h\xe2\x88\x921 was lower than from the pastures which ranged from 111 to 158 mg CO2-C m\xe2\x88\x922h\xe2\x88\x921. We found that temperature was not a good predictor of CO2 emissions from pasture but that there was a significant relationship (r = 0.72,p < 0.05) between soil moisture and pasture emissions. The \xce\xb413C of the soil CO2 emissions also was measured on chronosequence I; \xce\xb413C of the CO2 emitted from the C3 forest was \xe2\x88\x9229.43%. Pasture13CO2 \xce\xb4 values increased from \xe2\x88\x9217.91%. in the 3 year-old pasture to \xe2\x88\x9212.86% in the 80 year-old, reflecting the increasing C4 inputs with pasture age. Even in the youngest (3 year-old) pasture, 70 percent of the CO2 evolved originated from C4 pasture-derived carbon.'

Abstract: 'Cacao is an economically important commodity in Jamaica. Knowledge of the genetic diversity of Jamaican cacao germplasm is essential for their conservation and management. In spite of cacao\xe2\x80\x99s economic importance in Jamaica, the crop is under studied, therefore limiting sound decisions toward improving productivity. Assessment of germplasm and on-farm genetic diversity is required to assist selecting superior genotypes to propagate and distribute across the island, as well as to use them as parental clones in breeding programs. Using 94 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, 140 Jamaican cacao samples from two germplasm collections and a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s estate along with 150 reference samples were analyzed. The principal coordinate analysis demonstrated that the majority of the Jamaican cacao selections were hybrids derived from five original germplasm groups, including Criollo, Amelonado and three Upper Amazon Forastero groups. Among the Upper Amazon groups, the Bayesian clustering analysis revealed that the Parinari (PA) ancestral lineage contributed the most (29.9%) to the Jamaican cacao germplasm. The germplasm collections showed greater diversity in terms of ancestral contributions compared to the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s estate. However, the genetic differentiation between the three collecting sites was small (Fst\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.036), indicating that samples collected from the three sites were derived from a common pool of germplasm. The current study supports the historical records and clarified the ancestry of Jamaican cacao. Although the majority of the cacao genetic groups were observed in the Jamaican cacao collections, several diversity gaps were found in both germplasm collections and in\xc2\xa0the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s estate, especially germplasm with disease resistance to cacao frosty pod rot that was recently found in Jamaica.'

Abstract: ' We use microeconomic theory to frame hypotheses about the effects of income on the use of non-timber rain forest products. We hypothesize that an increase in income: (a) encourages foraging specialization, resulting in the extraction of fewer goods; (b) increases the share of household income from occupations besides foraging; (c) produces a yearly value from the extraction of nontimber forest goods of about $50 per hectare; and (d) produces depletion of forest goods entering commercial channels and sustainable extraction of goods facing cheaper industrial substitutes. To examine these hypotheses we present worldwide ethnographic information and preliminary findings from field work carried out among the Sumu Indians of Nicaragua. Field work suggests that higher income produces: (a) foraging specialization with animals rather than with plants; (b) a decline in the economic importance of forest goods in household income; (c) and a rise in the value of non-timber goods removed from the forest to about $35/ha/year. We did not have time to test hypothesis \xe2\x80\x9cd.\xe2\x80\x9d '

Abstract: 'There is a widely held notion that the increasing trend of urbanization accelerates loss of biodiversity and displaces native species. This study assessed the validity of this notion in the city of S\xc3\xa3o Lu\xc3\xads the capital of the state of Maranh\xc3\xa3o in the northeastern Brazil. The specific objectives of the study were to (1) assess plant and animal diversity of urban homegardens, (2) compare the diversity of homegardens in terms of origin of these species (exotic or indigenous to Brazil). We conducted a biodiversity survey in 40 randomly selected \xe2\x80\x98quintais\xe2\x80\x99 (hereafter called homegardens) from ten locations in the city of S\xc3\xa3o Luis. We evaluated the species richness and diversity of various use categories of plant and animal species indigenous to Brazil as well as exotic species. A total of 186 species of plants in 68 families were recorded in the sampled homegradens. A total of 63 fruit tree species representing 34% of all tree species were found. Of these species, those indigenous to Brazil accounted for 58% of the cases, and this was significantly higher than the exotic species. Most of the species (60%) were indigenous to Brazil (wild and semi-wild domesticates), while the rest (40%) were exotic. A total of 42 species of vertebrates (mainly reptiles, birds and mammals) were also found in the homegardens, of which 47% were indigenous to Brazil. Some of the plant and animal species found in the homegardens are endangered species in their native habitats, suggesting that homegardens could provide a unique opportunity for their conservation and sustainable use. These species continue to play a vital role in the socioeconomic and ecological landscape of the city.'

Abstract: 'Small farmers in the Bragantina (East-Amazonia, Brazil) traditionally apply a rotation of 2 years cultivation and 4\xe2\x80\x9310 years forest fallow. More recently introduced pepper plantations fell fallow after fungus hazards. We studied the floristic composition of this young secondary vegetation by means of 92 vegetation relev\xc3\xa9s in 58 plots of forest fallow and 34 plots of pepper fallow with sizes ranging from 40 to 300 m2. The age of the fallow vegetation ranged from 4 months to 10 years. We found 673 species belonging to 97 families. The list of plant species presented in the Appendix totals 827 species, including species collected in additional field surveys. The species are registered with scientific and local names as well as growth forms. The families with the largest numbers of species were Myrtaceae (34 species), Leguminosae (87), Sapindaceae (17), which contain mainly trees and shrubs, and Bignoniaceae (29), Connaraceae (12), Smilacaceae (22) with mainly vines, the forb dominated families Asteraceae (25), Euphorbiaceae (21), Rubiaceae (20), and Cyperaceae (16) and Poaceae (35). A comparison with local and regional inventories shows similarities to fallow vegetations and secondary forests, and floristic distance to primary forests.'

Abstract: 'Spatially precise forecasts of the impacts of climate change on the distribution of major vegetation types are essential for the implementation of effective conservation and land use policy. However, existing studies frequently omit major sources of climate variability that can significantly increase the uncertainty of projections. In this study we demonstrate how different predictions for sea surface temperature (SST) for the first half of the twenty-first century increase the uncertainty associated with forecasts of the future distribution of major ecosystems in South America. This is demonstrated through a numerical experiment using a coupled climate\xe2\x80\x93vegetation model (CCM3-IBIS) for IPCC emission scenario A2 that incorporates the SST data from ten different models. The study reveals an increasing uncertainty in the ability to forecast future vegetation patterns, such that by 2050 the simulation is unable to robustly forecast the vegetation cover in an area equivalent to 28\xc2\xa0% in South America (5\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89106\xc2\xa0km2). The future of the central and northeastern regions of Brazil is especially uncertain, with outcomes, ranging from savanna, and open shrubland to grassland. Recognizing and managing such uncertainty should be a priority for decision makers.'

Abstract: 'Literature on conservation and land reform politics concentrates on how local actors are characterized dualistically as either environmental villains or heroes. Here I present three different frames as exemplary of the multiple narratives at stake as actors create environmental subjectivities in relation to political opportunity, based primarily on ethnographic field research in a case study of Projects for Sustainable Development (PDSs) located in the Transamazon highway region of the Brazilian Amazon. I argue that local identities are mediated by their shifting relationships with other interested actors. Through a historical analysis of different frames of identity and land use, I examine how and why representation struggles occurred and shifted, based upon the ways in which powerful actors took advantage of political opportunities. This led to indeterminate outcomes in different local struggles across the region. In the process, local voices were often undermined in favor of interests of more powerful outsiders. The political process through which such struggles occur yield geographically and socially uneven effects contingent upon key events and contestation from disparate groups.'

Abstract: 'Managed forests are a major component of tropical landscapes. Production forests as designated by national forest services cover up to 400 million\xc2\xa0ha, i.e.\xc2\xa0half of the forested area in the humid tropics. Forest management thus plays a major role in the global carbon budget, but with a lack of unified method to estimate carbon fluxes from tropical managed forests. In this study we propose a new time- and spatially-explicit methodology to estimate the above-ground carbon budget of selective logging at regional scale.'

Abstract: 'Endemic South American river stingrays (Potamotrygonidae), which include the most diversified living freshwater chondrichthyans, were conspicuously absent from pre-Neogene deposits in South America despite the fact that recent phylogenetic analyses strongly suggest an older origination for this clade. To date, the rare representatives of this family were mostly represented by ambiguous isolated remains. Here, we report 67 isolated fossil teeth of a new obligate freshwater dasyatoid (Potamotrygon ucayalensis nov. sp) from the fossiliferous level CTA-27 (Yahuarango Formation), near Contamana, in the Peruvian Amazonia. We assigned this sample to a new representative of Potamotrygon by comparison with numerous fresh jaws of living specimens of Potamotrygonidae, thus providing the first detailed review of dental morphology for this poorly understood clade. These new fossils fill a long stratigraphic gap by extending the family range down to the middle Eocene (\xe2\x88\xbc41\xc2\xa0Mya). Moreover, the relative modernity and diversity in tooth morphology among Eocene freshwater stingrays (including Potamotrygon ucayalensis nov. sp. and coeval North American dasyatoids) indicate that the hypothetically marine ancestor of potamotrygonids probably invaded the rivers earlier than in the middle Eocene. The first potamotrygonids and affiliates were possibly more generalized and less endemic than now, which is consistent with an opportunistic filling of vacated ecospace.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation changes the hydrological, geomorphological, and biochemical states of streams by decreasing evapotranspiration on the land surface and increasing runoff, river discharge, erosion and sediment fluxes from the land surface. Deforestation has removed about 55% of the native vegetation and significantly altered the hydrological and morphological characteristics of an 82,632\xc2\xa0km2 watershed of the Araguaia River in east-central Brazil. Observed discharge increased by 25% from the 1970s to the 1990s and computer simulations suggest that about 2/3 of the increase is from deforestation, the remaining 1/3 from climate variability. Changes of this scale are likely occurring throughout the 2,000,000\xc2\xa0km2 savannah region of central Brazil.'

Abstract: 'Accurate monitoring of the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) in decreasing deforestation is increasingly important given the vital role of forest protection in climate change mitigation. Recent studies on PA effectiveness have used remote-sensing imagery to compare deforestation rates within PAs to surrounding areas. However, remote-sensing data used in isolation provides limited information on the factors contributing to effectiveness. We used landscape-modelling techniques to estimate the effectiveness of ten PAs in Madre de Dios, Peru. Factors influencing PA effectiveness were investigated using in situ key-informant interviews. Although all of the PAs studied had positive effectiveness scores, those with the highest scores were ecotourism and conservation concessions, where monitoring and surveillance activities and good relations with surrounding communities were reported as possible factors in decreasing deforestation rates. Native community areas had the lowest scores, with deforestation mainly driven by internal resource use and population growth. Weak local governance and immigration were identified as underlying factors decreasing the effectiveness of protection, whereas good relations with surrounding communities and monitoring activity increased effectiveness. The results highlight the need to combine remote sensing with in situ information on PA management because identification of drivers and deterrents of deforestation is vital for improving the effectiveness of protection.'

Abstract: 'This study focuses on investigating possible changes in hydrometeorological behavior on important Brazilian river basins for power generation purposes. Thereby, this research analyzes the historical averages and observed trends regarding rainfall and streamflow and their impact on the hydrological regime. Ten river basins were selected for the assessment of alterations in the precipitation and streamflow series throughout descriptive measures and statistical significance tests (Mann-Kendall and Sen\xe2\x80\x99s slope). These data are available over different time spans, but most of the records include information from 1961 to 2006. As long as these river basins are subjected to different climate types, their corresponding rainfall and streamflow patterns vary accordingly the basin location in the country, in addition to the season. Most of the country has a predominantly tropical climate, with a wet period concentrated between October and March and a dry period between April and September. Some exceptions are the Northeastern region, where the climate is semi-arid, besides the Southern region, where there is abundant precipitation throughout the year. According to the obtained results, it could be noted that the streamflow response to precipitation is faster in the smaller river basins, what can be due especially to the water travel time. It was found that Belo Monte basin, in Northern Brazil, presents a statistically significant reduction in the annual rainfall. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the annual streamflow was also identified in Xing\xc3\xb3 and Sobradinho basins, in the Northeastern region. In contrast, Itaipu basin, located in Southern Brazil, showed increasing statistically significant trends in annual rainfall and streamflow during the second half of the twentieth century. Relevant decreasing trends were also identified in the minimum streamflows of the Brazilian Northern and Northeastern basins and increasing ones in the maximum streamflows in the Southern region basins. The results obtained in this work will support the assessment of the impact of rainfall and streamflow future scenarios in regulating capacity of the hydroelectric power plant reservoirs.'

Abstract: "Unauthorized appropriation of geneticresources has been described by the term``biopiracy.'' Technological breakthroughsincluding biotechnological applications canincrease considerably the instrumental value ofbiodiversity as new products or products withnew properties can be made. Nevertheless, itappears that, in most cases, the properties inquestion were already known to the indigenouspeople and used for centuries. The analysisdiscusses both from an economic and an ethicalperspective whether it is just that traditionalknowledge is rewarded. As the conflictintensifies over questions of ownership andcontrol of biological materials, IntellectualProperty Rights are at the center ofcontroversies. The current global systemgoverning biotechnology has largely been shapedby Western expectations and valuations andconsequently has drawn severe criticism. Thecritics doubt both the stability andsustainability of the current patent system andargue for restructuring through benefit-sharingsystems in order to address some of theexisting inequalities. With the help of a casestudy (US patent no. 5,751 on ayahuasca) thetheoretical notion of biopiracy is applied toreal problems."

Abstract: 'Mapping the aboveground biomass of tropical forests is essential both for implementing conservation policy and reducing uncertainties in the global carbon cycle. Two medium resolution (500 m \xe2\x80\x93 1000 m) pantropical maps of vegetation biomass have been recently published, and have been widely used by sub-national and national-level activities in relation to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). Both maps use similar input data layers, and are driven by the same spaceborne LiDAR dataset providing systematic forest height and canopy structure estimates, but use different ground datasets for calibration and different spatial modelling methodologies. Here, we compare these two maps to each other, to the FAO\xe2\x80\x99s Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) 2010 country-level data, and to a high resolution (100 m) biomass map generated for a portion of the Colombian Amazon.'

Abstract: 'Stable isotopes are a powerful research tool in environmental sciences and their use in ecosystem research is increasing. In this review we introduce and discuss the relevant details underlying the use of carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions in ecosystem gas exchange research. The current use and potential developments of stable isotope measurements together with concentration and flux measurements of CO2 and water vapor are emphasized. For these applications it is critical to know the isotopic identity of specific ecosystem components such as the isotopic composition of CO2, organic matter, liquid water, and water vapor, as well as the associated isotopic fractionations, in the soil-plant- atmosphere system. Combining stable isotopes and concentration measurements is very effective through the use of \xe2\x80\x9dKeeling plots.\xe2\x80\x9d This approach allows the identification of the isotopic composition and the contribution of ecosystem, or ecosystem components, to the exchange fluxes with the atmosphere. It also allows the estimation of net ecosystem discrimination and soil disequilibrium effects. Recent modifications of the Keeling plot approach permit examination of CO2 recycling in ecosystems. Combining stable isotopes with dynamic flux measurements requires precision in isotopic sampling and analysis, which is currently at the limit of detection. Combined with the micrometeorological gradient approach (applicable mostly in grasslands and crop fields), stable isotope measurements allow separation of net CO2 exchange into photosynthetic and soil respiration components, and the evapotranspiration flux into soil evaporation and leaf transpiration. Similar applications in conjunction with eddy correlation techniques (applicable to forests, in addition to grasslands and crop fields) are more demanding, but can potentially be applied in combination with the Keeling plot relationship. The advance and potential in using stable isotope measurements should make their use a standard component in the limited arsenal of ecosystem-scale research tools.'

Abstract: 'Throughout history humans have manipulated their natural environment for an increased predictability and availability of plant and animal resources. Research on prehistoric diets increasingly includes small game, but edible insects receive minimal attention. Using the anthropological and archaeological literature we show and hypothesize about the existence of such environmental manipulations related to the procurement of edible insects. As examples we use eggs of aquatic Hemiptera in Mexico which are semi-cultivated by water management and by providing egg laying sites; palm weevil larvae in the Amazon Basin, tropical Africa, and New Guinea of which the collection is facilitated by manipulating host tree distribution and abundance and which are semi-cultivated by deliberately cutting palm trees at a chosen time at a chosen location; and arboreal, foliage consuming caterpillars in sub-Saharan Africa for which the collection is facilitated by manipulating host tree distribution and abundance, shifting cultivation, fire regimes, host tree preservation, and manually introducing caterpillars to a designated area. These manipulations improve insect exploitation by increasing their predictability and availability, and most likely have an ancient origin.'

Abstract: 'Aquatic vegetation is an important component of wetland and coastal ecosystems, playing a key role in the ecological functions of these environments. Surveys of macrophyte communities are commonly hindered by logistic problems, and remote sensing represents a powerful alternative, allowing comprehensive assessment and monitoring. Also, many vegetation characteristics can be estimated from reflectance measurements, such as species composition, vegetation structure, biomass, and plant physiological parameters. However, proper use of these methods requires an understanding of the physical processes behind the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and vegetation, and remote sensing of aquatic plants have some particular difficulties that have to be properly addressed in order to obtain successful results. The present paper reviews the theoretical background and possible applications of remote sensing techniques to the study of aquatic vegetation.'

Abstract: 'This study builds on earlier quantitative ethnobotanical studies to develop an approach which represents local values for useful forest species, in order to explore factors affecting those values. The method, based on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 ranking of taxa, compares favourably with more time-consuming quantitative ethnobotanical techniques, and allows results to be differentiated according to social factors (gender and ethnic origin), and ecological and socio-economic context. We worked with 126 respondents in five indigenous and five immigrant communities within a forest-dominated landscape in the Peruvian Amazonia. There was wide variability among responses, indicating a complex of factors affecting value. The most valued family is Arecaceae, followed by Fabaceae and Moraceae. Overall, fruit and non-commercialised construction materials predominate but women tend to value fruit and other non-timber species more highly than timber, while the converse is shown by men. Indigenous respondents tend to value more the species used for fruit, domestic construction and other NTFPs, while immigrants tend to favour commercialised timber species. Across all communities, values are influenced by both markets and the availability of the taxa; as the favourite species become scarce, others replace them in perceived importance. As markets become more accessible, over-exploitation of the most valuable species and livelihood diversification contribute to a decrease in perceived value of the forest.'

Abstract: 'Forests played an important role in carbon sequestration during the past two decades. Using a model tree ensemble method (MTE) to regress the seven reflectance bands of EOS-Terra-MODIS satellite data against country level forest biomass carbon density (BCD) of 2001\xe2\x80\x932005 provided by United Nations\xe2\x80\x99s Forest Resource Assessment (FRA), we developed a global map of forest BCD at 1 km\xc3\x971 km resolution for both 2001\xe2\x80\x932005 and 2006\xe2\x80\x932010. For 2006\xe2\x80\x932010, the total global forest biomass carbon stock is estimated as 279.6\xc2\xb17.1 Pg C, and the tropical forest biomass carbon stock is estimated as 174.4\xc2\xb15.4 Pg C. During the first decade of the 21st century, we estimated an increase of global forest biomass of 0.28\xc2\xb10.75 Pg C yr\xe2\x88\x921. Tropical forest biomass carbon stock slightly decreased (\xe2\x88\x920.31\xc2\xb10.60 Pg C yr\xe2\x88\x921); by contrast, temperate and boreal forest biomass increased (0.58\xc2\xb10.28 Pg C yr\xe2\x88\x921) during the same period. Our estimation of the global forest biomass carbon stock and its changes is subject to uncertainties due to lack of extensive ground measurements in the tropics, spatial heterogeneity in large countries, and different definitions of forest. The continuously monitoring of forest biomass carbon stock with MODIS satellite data will provide useful information for detecting forest changes.'

Abstract: 'The vegetation of the Campinaranas occurs in humid areas with hydromorphic sandy soils at the Amazon region. Thus, the determination and in situ monitoring of moisture content in Campinarana soils, besides the detection of subsurface layers are key measures for studying these soil\xe2\x80\x93vegetation systems. Also, the application of ground penetrating radar (GPR) in deep sandy sedimentary sequence of Amazonia is a promising tool to enhance the knowledge on depositional and soil formation features.'

Abstract: 'The Pantanal is the largest wetland in the world with extremely high plant and animal diversity, but large areas have been invaded by Vochysia divergens Pohl (Vochysiaceae), a tree that is native to the Amazon Basin, and Curatella americana L. (Dilleniaceae), a tree that is native to the Brazilian savanna (cerrado). V. divergens is reportedly floodadapted, thus its ability to invade the Pantanal may not be surprising, but the invasion of C. americana is counterintuitive, because this species is adapted to the well-drained soils of the cerrado. Thus, we were interested in comparing the photosynthetic capacity, in terms of CO2 conductance, carboxylation, and electron transport of these species over a seasonal flooding cycle. Given that V. divergens is reportedly flood-adapted, we predicted that this species would have a higher photosynthetic capacity than C. americana, especially under flooding. To test this hypothesis we measured the photosynthetic CO2 response (P N/C c) of V. divergens and C. americana within 1 year to determine, if photosynthetic capacity varied systematically over time and between species. Contrary to our hypothesis, V. divergens did not always have a higher photosynthetic capacity than C. americana. Rather, species differences were influenced by temporal variations in flooding and the leaf age. Leaf CO2 assimilation and photosynthetic capacity of both species were lower during the flood period, but the differences were not statistically significant. The physiological performance of both species was strongly related to leaf N and P concentrations, but P limitation appeared to be more important than N limitation for these species and ecosystem. Photosynthetic capacity was higher and more stable for V. divergens, but such an advantage did not result in a statistically significant increase in P N. Our results suggest that both species are tolerant to flooding even though they are adapted to very different hydrological conditions. Such physiological plasticity, especially for C. americana, might be a key feature for the ability to survive and persist in the seasonally flooded Pantanal.'

Abstract: "Shipibo Indians, who formed a village to establish a school and health clinic, are gradually depleting local fish and game resources. Men, recently adopting rice as a cash crop, tend to fish and hunt less than other men working only their subsistence gardens. Sale of fish and game in the village is becoming common, and pigs, once raised exclusively for sale to non-Shipibo, are now more regularly eaten and used for attracting agricultural labor. Other research has indicated that cash cropping often competes for workers' time in subsistence and so dietary change usually accompanies changing activity patterns. This paper explores the latter possibility by examining the relationship between cash cropping, wild meat procurement, and diet among the Shipibo. Time allocation and food consumption data are analyzed statistically to test a mathematical theory and model which relates indigenous work patterns to diet."

Abstract: ' I studied a group of woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha)for 1800 hr from early 1985 until September 1987 near the lower Apaporis river of the Vaup\xc3\xa9s Department in the eastern Colombian Amazon. The group had an activity budget of 29.9% rest, 38.8% move, 25.8% forage, and 5.5% other activities during 720 hr of observations evenly spaced throughout this year. The only significant change in these activities during the study period was social activity, which increased as a function of increased food supply. Average diurnal activities of resting and moving are negatively correlated, and each activity show significant changes during the day, while foraging show no significant change. The activity budgets of the adult males and females are not significantly different, but the activities of the juveniles and infants showed much more social activity than the adults. High moving scores may be correlated with the comparative infertility of the soils of the Capar\xc3\xba forest, which require increased effort to maintain the energy levels necessary for maintenance and reproduction in Lagothrix.'

Abstract: 'The present study reports field data of ticks infesting wild carnivores captured from July 1998 to September 2004 in Brazil. Additional data were obtained from one tick collection and from previous published data of ticks on carnivores in Brazil. During field work, a total of 3437 ticks were collected from 89 Cerdocyon thous (crab-eating-fox), 58 Chrysocyon brachyurus (maned-wolf), 30 Puma concolor (puma), 26 Panthera onca (jaguar), 12 Procyon cancrivorus (crab-eating-raccoon), 4 Speothos venaticus (bush-dog), 6 Pseudalopex vetulus (hoary-fox), 6 Nasua nasua (coati), 6 Leopardus pardalis (ocelot), 2 Leopardus tigrinus (oncilla), 1 Leopardus wiedii (margay), 1 Herpailurus yagouaroundi (jaguarundi), 1 Oncifelis colocolo (pampas-cat), 1 Eira barbara (tayara), 1 Galictis vittata (grison), 1 Lontra longicaudis (neotropical-otter), and 1 Potus flavus (kinkajou). Data obtained from the Acari Collection IBSP included a total of 381 tick specimens collected on 13 C. thous, 8 C. brachyurus, 3 P. concolor, 10 P. onca, 3 P. cancrivorus, 4 N. nasua, 1 L. pardalis, 1 L. wiedii, 4 H. yagouaroundi, 1 Galictis cuja (lesser grison), and 1 L. longicaudis. The only tick infested-carnivore species previously reported in Brazil, for which we do not present any field data are Pseudalopex gymnocercus (pampas fox), Conepatus chinga (Molina\xe2\x80\x99s hog-nosed skunk), and Conepatus semistriatus (striped hog-nosed skunk). We report the first tick records in Brazil on two Felidae species (O. colocolo, H. yagouaroundi), two Canidae species (P. vetulus, S. venaticus), one Procyonidae species (P. flavus) and one Mustelidae (E. barbara). Tick infestation remains unreported for 5 of the 26 Carnivora species native in Brazil: Oncifelis geoffroyi (Geoffroy\xe2\x80\x99s cat), Atelocynus microtis (short-eared dog), Pteronura brasiliensis (giant otter), Mustela africana (Amazon weasel), and Bassaricyon gabbii (olingo). Our field data comprise 16 tick species represented by the genera Amblyomma (12 species), Ixodes (1 species), Dermacentor (1 species), Rhipicephalus (1 species), and Boophilus (1 species). Additional 5 tick species (3 Amblyomma species and 1 species from each of the genera Ixodes and Ornithodoros) were reported in the literature. The most common ticks on Carnivora hosts were Amblyomma ovale (found on 14 host species), Amblyomma cajennense (10 species), Amblyomma aureolatum (10 species), Amblyomma tigrinum (7 species), Amblyomma parvum (7 species), and Boophilus microplus (7 species).'

Abstract: 'Phosphorus, manganese, sulfur (S), lead, and strontium of atmospheric total suspended particulate matter, sampled during the rainy season and the dry season 2002 at the Ilha Grande Island (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil) have been analyzed by XRF techniques. The results showed total mean concentrations of 27\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8916\xc2\xa0ng P\xc2\xa0m-3, 11\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x897\xc2\xa0ng Mn\xc2\xa0m-3, 159\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89126\xc2\xa0ng S\xc2\xa0m-3, 4.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.6\xc2\xa0ng Pb\xc2\xa0m-3, and 208\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89148\xc2\xa0ng Sr\xc2\xa0m-3. Generally, there is no clear influence of the two different climatic periods on the concentrations of most analyzed trace elements, with exception of sulfur the mean concentration of which, during the dry season, is about 60% higher than during the rainy season. This is probably due to biomass burning, a common practice in the Brazilian Southeast and Amazon region and/or to the presence of marine aerosols. The linear correlation coefficients strongly suggest the same source for P, Pb, and Mn. Some Pb, Mn, and P concentrations are in the range of typical values of urban areas. Potential sources of such elements are the urban and industrial emissions from the States of Rio de Janeiro and/or S\xc3\xa3o Paulo.'

Abstract: 'Not many years ago both anthropology and political science experienced internal disputes\xe2\x80\x94in the first case over the publication of a book accusing a noted anthropologist of endangering indigenous subjects and in the second over the nature of the field. While the first led to polarization, the second produced a partial convergence and modest reforms. This article examines the two processes and seeks the key mechanisms that produced those differences, closing with a call for broadening the study of contentious politics to cover non-public controversies like the ones examined in this article.'

Abstract: 'Climate models often use a simplified and static representation of vegetation characteristics to determine fluxes of energy, momentum and water vapour between surface and lower atmosphere. In order to analyse the impact of short term variability in vegetation phenology, we use remotely-sensed leaf area index and albedo products to examine the role of vegetation in the coupled land\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere system. Perfect model experiments are carried out to determine the impact of realistic temporal variability of vegetation on potential predictability of evaporation and temperature, as well as model skill of EC-Earth simulations. The length of the simulation period is hereby limited by the availability of satellite products to 2000\xe2\x80\x932010. While a realistic representation of vegetation positively influences the simulation of evaporation and its potential predictability, a positive impact on 2\xc2\xa0m temperature is of smaller magnitude, regionally confined and more pronounced in climatically extreme years.'

Abstract: 'Moving back in time from the early colonial to the late pre-colonial period we evaluate the hypothesis asserting the migratory movement of Cariban-speaking groups from the Middle Orinoco River area towards north-central Venezuela. The explanation in vogue maintains that the migration followed fluvial routes and occurred between 1350 and 1150 BP (AD 600\xe2\x80\x93800). We examine archaeological, linguistic, ethnohistorical, genetic, and ecological data seeking similarities between the Orinoco emigrants and their north-central Venezuelan descendants. As a result, we propose an alternative terrestrial/fluvial route and suggest these events occurred between 1150 and 1050 BP (AD 800\xe2\x80\x93900). The route first proceeded upstream along rivers of the central llanos and later followed a natural terrestrial geomorphological corridor into the Lake Valencia Basin. We argue that, while future interdisciplinary (especially archaeo-linguistic and bioarchaeological) research is needed to further assess the results of these analyses, the Orinocan descendants in north-central Venezuela emerge as one of the most dynamic sociopolitical Cariban-speaking entities in all northeastern South America and the insular Caribbean on the eve of the European Conquest.\n'

Abstract: 'The white-fronted spider monkey, Ateles marginatus, is endemic to Brazilian Amazon between the Tapaj\xc3\xb3s and Xingu Rivers, and is classified as endangered due primarily to habitat loss. This study presents data on the distribution and relative abundance of the species in the northwestern corner of its distribution, on the lower Tapaj\xc3\xb3s River, centered on the 545,000\xc2\xa0ha Tapaj\xc3\xb3s National Forest (Flona Tapaj\xc3\xb3s). Quantitative data were collected in line transect surveys at 14 sites, and confirmatory interviews were conducted at these, and a further four sites. The results indicate that A.\xc2\xa0marginatus is extinct or extremely rare at sites in the northern extreme of the study area, but is relatively widespread further south, except in very small fragments (<100 ha). While the present-day occurrence of A.\xc2\xa0marginatus is clearly affected by habitat fragmentation, the species\xe2\x80\x99 original distribution appears to have been characterized by local lacunas, determined by factors relating to habitat quality. While hunting pressure does not seem to be a major threat at the present time, competition with a second atelid, Alouatta discolor, may have reinforced the effects of habitat disturbance in some areas, especially smaller fragments. Grouping patterns were typical of the genus, including an apparent female bias in the sex ratio of adults. Overall, the results indicate an ongoing decline in the occurrence of A.\xc2\xa0marginatus within the study area, local extinction, especially in smaller fragments, and an urgent need for the establishment of effective conservation measures.'

Abstract: 'The results of the first detailed study of the use of medicinal plants by a group of Yanomami Indians are presented. Contrary to previous assumptions, they are shown to possess a substantial pharmacopoeia, including at least 113 species of plants and fungi. The changes in their use and knowledge of plant medicine are discussed in the context of the past and present influences on the Yanomami by the outside world.'

Abstract: 'Despite its central importance to tropical forest conservation, the understanding of patterns in traditional resource use still is incipient. To address this deficiency, we compared known palm uses among two indigenous (Yawanawd and Kaxinaw\xc3\xa1) and two folk (rubber tapper and ribeirinho) communities in Southwestern Amazonia (Acre, Brazil). We conducted one-hundred-and -forty semi-structured \xe2\x80\x9cchecklist\xe2\x80\x9d interviews about palm uses with male and female adults in the four communities. The knowledge of each community about the uses of the 17 palm species common to all communities was compared by testing for significant differences in the mean number of uses cited per informant and by calculating the Jaccard similarity index of known uses of palm species among the four communities. The following three hypotheses were confirmed: 1) the use of palms differs according to the cultural preferences of each community; 2) indigenous communities know significantly more about palm uses than folk communities; and 3) part of the indigenous knowledge was acquired through contact with Amazonian folk communities.'

Abstract: 'Aiming to complement the group\xe2\x80\x99s taxonomy, the objective of this work is to describe and characterise,  searching for morpho-anatomical patterns, the leaf anatomy of the Manilkara species occurring in the northeast region of Brazil. The leaves of all Manilkara species were analysed, using herbaria specimens and collections made in the field by the authors. The characterisation of the leaf blades was performed according to the usual protocols in vegetal anatomy. As diagnosed by anatomical characters, the Manilkara Adans. genus presents petioles with a thick cuticle, a uniseriate epidermis, a sclerenchymatous sheath involving the vascular bundle, and laticifers on the cortical and medullar regions. The anatomical data increase the M. elata and M. huberi synonymisation and show the importance of the anatomy as a complementary tool to the taxonomy based on external morphology.'

Abstract: 'Using a three-dimensional (3-D) transport model of the troposphere, we calculated the global distributions of ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH 4 + ), taking into account removal of NH3 on acidic aerosols, in liquid water clouds and by reaction with OH. Our estimated global 10\xc2\xb0\xc3\x9710\xc2\xb0 NH3 emission inventory of 45 Tg N-NH3 yr\xe2\x88\x92 provides a reasonable agreement between calculated wet NH 4 +  deposition and measurements and of measured and modeled NH 4 +  in aerosols, although in Africa and Asia especially discrepancies exist.'

Abstract: 'The oil industry is a major source of contamination in Peru, and wastewater and sediments containing oil include harmful substances that may have acute and chronic effects. This study determined polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations by GC/MS, mutagenicity using TA98 and TA100 bacterial strains with and without metabolic activation in the Muta-ChromoPlate\xe2\x84\xa2 test, and Microtox\xc2\xae 5-min EC50 values of Peruvian crude oil, and water and sediment pore water from the vicinity of San Jos\xc3\xa9 de Saramuro on the Mara\xc3\xb1\xc3\xb3n River and Villa Trompeteros on the Corrientes River in Loreto, Peru. The highest total PAH concentration in both areas was found in water (Saramuro\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89210.15\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml, Trompeteros\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89204.66\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml). Total PAH concentrations in water from San Jos\xc3\xa9 de Saramuro ranged from 9.90 to 210.15\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml (mean\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8966.48\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml), while sediment pore water concentrations ranged from 2.19 to 70.41\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml (mean\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8924.33\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml). All water samples tested from Saramuro and Trompeteros sites, and one out of four sediment pore water samples from Trompeteros, were found to be mutagenic (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). One sediment pore water sample in Saramuro was determined to have a measurable toxicity (Microtox EC50\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89335.1\xc2\xa0mg/l), and in Trompeteros, the EC50 in water and sediment pore water ranged from 25.67 to 133.86\xc2\xa0mg/l. Peruvian crude oil was mutagenic using the TA98 strain with metabolic activation, and the EC50 was 17.18\xc2\xa0mg/l. The two areas sampled had very high PAH concentrations that were most likely associated with oil activities, but did not lead to acute toxic effects. However, since most of the samples were mutagenic, it is thought that there is a greater potential for chronic effects.'

Abstract: "We determined the effect of fertilization treatments (control (C), complete nutrient amendment without nitrogen (PT), nitrogen only (N) and a complete nutrient amendment (NPT)) on fine root biomass in a tropical montane forest in Hawai'i. Fertilization significantly decreased root biomass; live fine root mass (<2 mm diameter) for the C, PT, N and NPT treatments were 335, 145, 110 and 105 g\xc2\xb7m-2, respectively. Nutrient availability appears to control fine root mass in this primary successional forest."

Abstract: 'In a 1 ha square plot of terra firme forest at 260 m elevation in Amazonian Ecuador, all trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) \xe2\x89\xa55 cm were studied. There were 1561 individuals, 473 species, 187 genera and 54 families. Of these, 693 individuals, 307 species, 138 genera and 46 families had a dbh \xe2\x89\xa510 cm. This is the highest number of tree species ever recorded for a tropical rain forest sample of this size. In both dbh classes, the most species-rich families were: Fabaceae sensu lato (including Mimosaceae and Caesalpiniaceae), Lauraceae and Sapotaceae; the most species-rich genera, were Pouteria, Inga and Protium. The vertical space was partitioned among species: 166 species were found only in the 5\xe2\x80\x9310 dbh cm class and were mostly sub-canopy treelets, and 307 species with dbh \xe2\x89\xa510 cm were mostly large canopy trees.'

Abstract: 'Spatial variability of physical and chemical properties in Amazonian soils is evaluated on sites of natural rain forest and pastures of different age in the Amazon region. The sampling scheme was regionalized using transects of fifty points 3 m apart each. Variables analysed were: soil bulk density; resistance to penetration; soil water content; available water; pH and extractable ions such as Ca, K, Al, P and Zn. Geostatistical analyses show that most variables are space independent for the 3 m spacing used. Variances indicate a much lower variability of the measured properties in the forest as compared to pastures.'

Abstract: 'The general circulation model of the NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS GCM) was designed primarily for global climate change and climate sensitivity applications. The modelling group at GISS has developed new and more physically appropriate parameterizations of meteorological/hydrological processes which are being validated in an effort to improve the performance of the Model II version of the GISS GCM. This study discusses some preliminary evaluations of this testing based on multiple-year simulations at 4\xc2\xb0 latitude by 5\xc2\xb0 longitude horizontal resolution. These runs individually incorporate new formulations of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the moist cumulus convection scheme and the ground hydrology and compare results using B-grid and C-grid numerics. The new PBL produces a realistically stronger tropical surface circulation, while the new cumulus scheme generates more realistic distributions of tropical convection and moisture. The main impact of the more sophisticated ground hydrology model is to increase surface air temperatures. Improvements in modelled sea level pressure and rainfall features by the C-grid are somewhat offset by increases in speed excesses at the cores of the summer hemisphere westerly jets. Each modelling innovation targeted a different aspect of the climate not adequately represented by Model II. However, since the various modelling changes were tested individually, the present evaluation could not demonstrate many dramatic improvements in the simulated climates. This documentation of impacts should, however, serve as a benchmark for the validation of future simulations of the GISS GCM that combine all of the modelling improvements.'

Abstract: 'This study compares historical simulations of the terrestrial carbon cycle produced by 10 Earth System Models (ESMs) that participated in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Using MODIS satellite estimates, this study validates the simulation of gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and carbon use efficiency (CUE), which depend on plant function types (PFTs). The models show noticeable deficiencies compared to the MODIS data in the simulation of the spatial patterns of GPP and NPP and large differences among the simulations, although the multi-model ensemble (MME) mean provides a realistic global mean value and spatial distributions. The larger model spreads in GPP and NPP compared to those of surface temperature and precipitation suggest that the differences among simulations in terms of the terrestrial carbon cycle are largely due to uncertainties in the parameterization of terrestrial carbon fluxes by vegetation. The models also exhibit large spatial differences in their simulated CUE values and at locations where the dominant PFT changes, primarily due to differences in the parameterizations. While the MME-simulated CUE values show a strong dependence on surface temperatures, the observed CUE values from MODIS show greater complexity, as well as non-linear sensitivity. This leads to the overall underestimation of CUE using most of the PFTs incorporated into current ESMs. The results of this comparison suggest that more careful and extensive validation is needed to improve the terrestrial carbon cycle in terms of ecosystem-level processes.'

Abstract: 'Four hectares were inventoried for all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) of 10cm or greater in a terra firme forest 200km Northeast of Manaus, Central Amazonia. The number of species varied from 137 to 168, the number of individuals from 639 to 713, total basal area from 32.8 to 40.2 and total biomass from 405 to 560 tons per hectare. The majority of trees, 90%, had a DBH between 10 and 30 cm. Leguminosae, Lauraceae, Sapotaceae, Chrysobalanaceae and Moraceae were the most rich families (number of species) in all sampled hectares. The most abundant families in all sampled hectares (number of trees) were Leguminosae, Burseraceae, Myristicaceae, Moraceae and Chrysobalanaceae. The most dominant families in all sampled hectares (basal area and biomass) were Leguminosae, Lecythidaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Bombacaceae and Moraceae. Similarity indexes at family level varied from 67 to 86% between the four hectares sampled. Alexa grandiflora (Leguminosae) was the most abundant species in the hectares one and three, while Scleronema micranthum (Bombacaceae), and Oenocarpus bacaba (Palmae) were the most abundant species in hectares two and four. S. micranthum was the most dominant species (basal area) in hectares one and two, while Bertholletia excelsa (Lecythidaceae) and Goupia glabra (Celastraceae) were the most dominant species in hectares three and four. S. micranthum (Bombacaceae), Buchenavia sp. 2 (Combretaceae), B. excelsa (Lecythidaceae) Couepia obovata (Chrysobalanaceae) were the most dominant species (biomass) in hectares one to four, respectively. Similarity indexes at species level varied from 26 to 44% between the four sampled hectares. This inventory is compared with previous studies and it was found that, in our study area, there was a greater proportion of trees of 60cm diameter or more and consequently a considerably higher total basal area. It is concluded that there are still an inadequate number of inventories of Amazonian terra firme forests to elucidate the major floristic pattern a both regional and local levels. Since the area is a mosaic of distinct floristic communities it is essential to obtain further standardized inventory data in order to set adequate conservation policies for the region.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\xa2 Studies dealing with the estimation of biomass, site productivity and the contribution of forests to the global carbon balance require the use of allometric equations. There have been a great number of equations developed to estimate biomass components of trees and shrubs in various ecosystems. However, there are less literature compilations that address the calculations of biomass components.'

Abstract: 'Over the past century, the total material wealth of humanity has been enhanced. However, in the twenty-first century, we face scarcity in critical resources, the degradation of ecosystem services, and the erosion of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s capability to absorb our wastes. Equity issues remain stubbornly difficult to solve. This situation is novel in its speed, its global scale and its threat to the resilience of the Earth System. The advent of the Anthropence, the time interval in which human activities now rival global geophysical processes, suggests that we need to fundamentally alter our relationship with the planet we inhabit. Many approaches could be adopted, ranging from geo-engineering solutions that purposefully manipulate parts of the Earth System to becoming active stewards of our own life support system. The Anthropocene is a reminder that the Holocene, during which complex human societies have developed, has been a stable, accommodating environment and is the only state of the Earth System that we know for sure can support contemporary society. The need to achieve effective planetary stewardship is urgent. As we go further into the Anthropocene, we risk driving the Earth System onto a trajectory toward more hostile states from which we cannot easily return.'

Abstract: 'Weeds in tropical agricultural systems can cause serious economic damage, and their control often requires the commitment of substantial resources in the way of labor, capital, or pesticides. Tropical shifting cultivation systems employ a fallow period to help overcome weed infestations in addition to improving soil productivity and reducing other pest populations. Short-term, intensive fallow systems that employ herbaceous and woody species to facilitate rapid restoration of soil productivity have evolved as an alternative to long-term fallows. Short-term fallows can impact weeds at all growth stages and play a role in the integrated management of weeds and crops. Fallow management that promotes vegetative soil cover may reduce weed recruitment due to attenuation of soil temperature and/or shift in light quality at the soil surface. Residues or litterfall from fallow species may alter the chemical and microbial ecology of the soil to favor losses from the weed seed bank due to germination, loss of seed vigor, or seed decay. In addition, fallow vegetation can influence weed seed predation. Enhancement of soil productivity should increase the vigor of crop growth and enable crops to better compete with weeds. The burning of fallow species residues may result in weed seed death due to extreme temperatures or may induce seed germination by the release of mechanical dormancy or chemical germination cues. Certain weeds may serve as improved fallow species due to their high nutrient scavenging efficiency in low-fertility environments and their ease of establishment. Short-term improved fallows can be an important component of integrated weed management, particularly by promoting the prevention and tolerance of weeds in crops.'

Abstract: 'If specialization influences species presence, then high tropical tree and shrub diversity should correspond with high environmental heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity may be found among different successional communities (i.e., canopy types). We explore species associations in three forest-dominated canopy types, forest, gap, and edge, in Kibale National Park, Uganda and determine environmental, soil and light, differences among canopy types. To determine the strength of differences among forested canopy types, they are also compared to grasslands. Tree and shrub density and species richness using rarefaction analysis were determined based on data from 24 small plots (5\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0m) in all four canopy types and 16 large plots (10\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa050\xc2\xa0m) in forest and grassland canopy types. Environmental variables were determined along 10 (20\xc2\xa0m) transects in the four canopy types. Using analysis of variance and principal components analysis, we demonstrate that forest and gap environments had similar soils, but forest had lower light levels than gap. We also found that grassland and edge were more similar to one another than to forest and gap, but differed in a number of important biotic and abiotic factors controlling soil water availability (e.g., edge had higher root length density of small roots < 2\xc2\xa0mm diameter in the top 20\xc2\xa0cm than grassland). Using principal components analysis to assess similarities in community composition, we demonstrate that gap and forest had indistinguishable communities and that edge was similar to but distinct from both communities. Complete species turnover only occurred between grassland and the three forested canopy types. Even though overall community composition was similar in the three forested canopy types, in analyses of individual species using randomization tests, many common species were most frequently found in only one canopy type; these patterns held across size classes. These results suggest that despite differences among environments, community composition was similar among forested canopy types, which are likely intergrading into one another. Interestingly, individual species are more frequently found in a single canopy type, indicating species specialization.'

Abstract: 'In 1989 Guyana designated 3600 km2 of tropical rain forest as the \xe2\x80\x98Iwokrama Rain Forest Programme\xe2\x80\x99 (IRFP) for developing methods of sustainable forest utilization and for conserving biodiversity. Bat diversity was assessed in 5 km2 of the IRFP area over a ten-week period. Effort totalled 22 400 m2 mist-net hours during 26 nights, 227 m2 harp-trap hours during 8 nights and 28 person days searching for roosts. This revealed 38 species of bats. In comparison with two other neotropical sites alpha diversity was high as shown by a Shannon diversity index of 1.30 for the 33 species taken in foraging areas by mist net and harp trap.'

Abstract: "  Aim: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the ability of cat's claw, an Amazonian medicinal plant, to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, collect safety and tolerance information and compare the antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory actions of Uncaria guianensis and Uncaria tomentosa in vitro.\xc2\xb6Materials and methods: Forty-five patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were recruited, 30 were treated with freeze-dried U. guianensis, and 15 with placebo. Hematological parameters were assessed on entry and exit of the four-week trial. Pain, medical and subject assessment scores and adverse effects were collected at weeks 1, 2 and 4. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of the cat's claw species was determined by the \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-diphenyl-\xce\xb2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging method. Inhibition of TNF\xce\xb1 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was determined in RAW 264.7 cells by ELISA.\xc2\xb6Results: Cat's claw had no deleterious effects on blood or liver function or other significant side-effects compared to placebo. Pain associated with activity, medical and patient assessment scores were all significantly reduced, with benefits occurring within the first week of therapy. Knee pain at rest or at night, and knee circumference were not significantly reduced by cat's claw during this brief trial. In vitro tests indicated that U. guianensis and U. tomentosa were equivalent at quenching DPPH radicals (EC50, 13.6-21.7 \xce\xbcg/ml) as well as inhibiting TNF\xce\xb1 production. However, the latter action was registered at much lower concentrations (EC50, 10.2-10.9 ng/ml). Cat's claw (10 \xce\xbcg/ml) had no effect on basal PGE2 production, but reduced LPS-induced PGE2 release (P < 0.05), but at higher concentrations than that required for TNF\xce\xb1 inhibition.\xc2\xb6Conclusion: Cat's claw is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis. The species, U. guianensis and U. tomentosa are equiactive. They are effective antioxidants, but their anti-inflammatory properties may result from their ability to inhibit TNF\xce\xb1 and to a lesser extent PGE2 production."

Abstract: 'We compared ecological and morphological patterns among cichlid faunas from three different biotic regions: the R\xc3\xado Tortuguero/Rio Sarapiquf in Costa Rica, the R\xc3\xado Apure drainage in Venezuela, and the Upper Zambezi drainage in Zambia. Cichlids comprise 19 percent of the fish fauna in the Tortuguero and Upper Zambezi drainages and 6.5 percent in the Apure drainage. Cichlid faunas exhibited similar patterns of habitat and food resource utilization, although vegetation-dwelling is more common and detritivory and herbivory are rarer in the Apure fauna. We hypothesize that South American ostariophysan fishes were more preadapted than cichlids to exploit detritivore and herbivore niches. The Zambezi cichlid fauna shows less ecomorphological diversification than the other two faunas, even though the degree of dietary diversification is similar among faunas. Chaetobranchus flavescens from the Venezuelan fauna is the only species that specializes on zooplankton as an adult, and algae grazing (Neetroplus nematopus) and specialized fruit feeding (\xe2\x80\x98Cichlasoma\xe2\x80\x99 tuba) were represented only in the Costa Rican fauna. Based on the most recent hypothesized phylogeny for the family Cichlidae, we identified numerous interfaunal ecomorphological and feeding niche convergences. Patterns of ecomorphological divergence in relation to cladogenesis indicate a faster rate of evolutionary niche diversification in Central American cichlids compared with the two other faunas.'

Abstract: 'The demography of the acaulescent palm Attalea humilis was studied from 1996 to 1999 in three forest fragments (1.6, 6.4, and 9.9\xe2\x80\x89ha) in southeastern Brazil (22\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x9322\xc2\xb033\xe2\x80\xb2 S, 42\xc2\xb015\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x9342\xc2\xb019\xe2\x80\xb2 W). A human-induced fire damaged the populations in August\xe2\x80\x93September 1997. Palm density was higher in the medium-sized fragment, where it was concentrated in a single disturbed sector. Population ontogenetic stage structure was dependent on fragment and year, but in general later stages were more abundant than initial ones. Population finite growth rates projected from linear, stage-structured demographic models indicated that the populations were increasing before fire. Population growth rate in the smallest fragment was larger due to a single recruitment event, being most sensitive to changes in survival and growth of seedlings, virgins and the immature, and relatively insensitive to changes in shrinkage and fecundity. Observed growth rates for the entire study period showed that populations remained in equilibrium after fire, but the population in the medium-sized fragment showed a declining tendency. Population structure was resilient to fire, which caused a transitory concentration of individuals in the medium-sized stage. The self-sustainability of the population in the largest, most preserved fragment suggests that habitat-protection measures may suffice to ensure the persistence of populations in small fragments. However, population fluctuations and exclusion from hyper-disturbed sectors in the smallest fragment suggest that reduced fragment area, habitat degradation and human-induced fires can interact to threaten the persistence of even abundant, preadapted to fire, species like A. humilis.'

Abstract: "The world's tropical rain forests are being cleared at an ever-increasing and alarming rate. If their destruction continues, such forests will virtually disappear over the next half century, with grave consequences to mankind."

Abstract: 'General ecological expectations about the relationship between latitude and species richness are that at low latitudes (the tropics) species richness is greater than at higher latitudes (temperate and polar regions). Recent work suggests that this may not be the case for several habitat types and biological groups in Australia. Results are conflicting: on present evidence (admittedly sparse) it appears that in Australian tropical fresh waters species richness is generally depressed in zooplankton and littoral microfaunal communities, but not in macroinvertebrate communities in typical streams and in fish communities (and perhaps also in amphibian and reptile communities). The situation is indeterminate for tropical phytoplankton and macrophyte communities.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we investigate whether traditional swidden agriculture on nutrient-poor tropical soils can sustainably support a growing indigenous population within Manu National Park, Peru. Based on interviews with 50 Matsigenka farmers, as well as GPS mapping and field visits, we established the location and size of all 124 swidden gardens cultivated in 2000 and 2001. Using a GIS-based soil map of Manu Park, we identify the total extent of potential arable land (1) throughout the park zones currently available for Matsigenka habitation, and (2) within the vicinity of the two study communities. Taking into account current per capita garden size, cultivation and fallow practices, we calculate the maximum human carrying capacity of swidden agriculture for (1) all available park zones and (2) the immediate vicinity of the two current communities. Even given the second, highly limited scenario, the sustainable human carrying capacity is estimated to be 2,138 individuals, which is far higher than the current population of about 420 people. Thus, arable land does not appear to be a limiting factor for the growth of the indigenous population in Manu Park at the current time. Other possible limiting factors for population growth are identified and discussed. We conclude that a conservation policy of population stabilization around the current settlements is viable in that it will not result in reduced resource availability over the next few decades, and that the challenge is to identify and mitigate the forces causing population fissioning and spread.'

Abstract: ' Habitat fragmentation is recognized as one of the main factors associated with species extinction and is particularly acute in South American forest habitats. In this study, we examined the effects of forest fragmentation on the beetle assemblage at the relict temperate forest of Fray Jorge (Chile). We evaluated the following hypotheses: (1) there is a strong edge effect, so that the number of beetle species and individuals increases away from the edge, towards the inner part of each fragment, (2) this pattern should be apparent in the larger fragments but not in the smaller ones, where edge effects are expected to be stronger, and (3) there should be a significant interaction between number of species/individuals found inside and outside fragments (i.e., in the matrix) and season, because of an increase in aridity and water stress during austral summer months. We found that the relationship between the number of individuals and number of species vs distance from the matrix towards the forest interior was affected by fragment size and season. In general, both number of species and individuals tended to increase from the matrix towards the forest edge and then either decrease, increase or maintain a constant level, depending on fragment size and season. The result of an ANOVA analysis, which used season, size, and position (inside vs outside fragments) as factors and number of individuals as the response variable, showed a significant effect of fragment size, position, and season and a significant interaction between fragment size and season, season and position, and size and position. ANOVA analysis using number of species as the response variable showed that area, season, and position all had significant effects. The results also showed a significant interaction between size and season and between season and position. Our results emphasize the existence of strong fragment-size and seasonal effects modulating both the response of beetles to fragmentation and their abundance and distribution in temperate areas. Thus, seasonal dynamic effects can be of paramount importance to demonstrate and understand the effect of habitat fragmentation upon arthropod assemblages in temperate areas.'

Abstract: 'Pingbian Miao Autonomous County is one of the poorest rural areas in China. Land-use changes, mainly driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation, may significantly impact ecosystem services and functions, but such effects are difficult to quantify. In the present study, Landsat image data were combined with the published coefficients about the world and China ecosystem to quantify land-use and ecosystem service changes in the mountainous area. A sensitivity analysis was employed to determine the effect of manipulating these coefficients on the estimated values. Our results show that during the past decades (from 1973 to 2004) forests and grasslands were converted into shrubland and cropland, respectively, resulting in a continuous decrease in ecosystem service (from 124.5 US$ \xc3\x97 106 in 1973 to 100.4 US$ \xc3\x97 106 in 2004). We found that the decrease of mixed forest in the study area was the largest contributor (i.e., 25.4 US$ \xc3\x97 106) to the decline of the ecosystem service. Therefore we propose that future land-use policy should pay more attention to the crucial ecosystem functions of these forests (including tropical forest), and that it is necessary to balance the relationship between the livelihood of local farmers and environmental protection in order to maintain a healthy and stable ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Responding to the decline of game, fruit and fiber post-logging, communities along the Capim River in Par\xc3\xa1, Brazil, requested that research be initiated into the value of non-timber forest products. As a first step, an ethnobotanical inventory of one hectare of mature terra firme forest was conducted. The percentage use-values described reflect that Capimenses are knowledgeable about the use of many species (60% of inventoried species); however, active use has declined. Compared to other South American inventories, Capimenses demonstrate a higher degree of trade in timber, a lack of trade in non-timber products, the decreasing use of plants for technological purposes, and the description of the use of many species in the past tense. During the longitudinal study, the 15 most highly valued fruit, nut, game attracting, and medicinal tree species became included in the suite of species extracted by the timber industry.'

Abstract: 'Present study deals with the vegetation type mapping, structure and composition analysis of the tropical forests, spread over 1,294 km2 area in South Andaman Islands. Seventeen vegetation classes spreading over 89.92% forested area of the islands were mapped with the overall accuracy of 88.89%. Evergreen, semi-evergreen and mangrove forests were reasonably well distributed forests, while moist deciduous and littoral evergreen were narrowly restricted. The stocking was quite variable across the forest types. 60.04% of forested area was under medium to high canopy density. Secondary and degraded forest types were mapped. Information on floristic composition, structure and diversity of various forest types were obtained from 84 field sample plots. An inventory of 423 species of plants from 101 families included 155 trees, 84 shrubs, 150 herbs and 84 climbers. Tree density and mean basal area ranged from 517 to 900 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 36.15 to 53.58 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921 respectively. Evergreen forests accounted for highest diversity followed almost equally by semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests.'

Abstract: 'The prevalence of allergic airway diseases such as asthma and rhinitis has increased dramatically to epidemic proportions worldwide. Besides air pollution from industry derived emissions and motor vehicles, the rising trend can only be explained by gross changes in the environments where we live. The world economy has been transformed over the last 25 years with developing countries being at the core of these changes. Around the planet, in both developed and developing countries, environments are undergoing profound changes. Many of these changes are considered to have negative effects on respiratory health and to enhance the frequency and severity of respiratory diseases such as asthma in the general population.'

Abstract: 'Mountain areas are recognized centres of endemism and diversity on account of their isolation and altitudinal diversity. In tropical regions, mountain tops usually stand as islands of xeric vegetation among mesophytic assemblages. Unlike the vegetation growing on other rock outcrops lithologies, such as inselbergs (granite/gneiss) or campos rupestres (quartz/arenite), ironstone outcrop plant communities still lack systematic studies in Brazil. These outcrops (locally known as canga) share most of the characteristics of other rock outcrops, such as isolation and edapho-climatic harshness, but differ in that they are the object of opencast mining, and thus subjected to irrecoverable degradation. In addition, they are expected to harbour metal-tolerant and hyperaccumulator plant species. A botanical survey of two ironstone outcrop locations in the most important mining region of southeastern Brazil, the Iron Quadrangle, revealed a high within-site (138 and 160 species per site), and between-site diversity (only 27% of common species), totaling 64 families and 234 species among basal families and eudicots (154 species), monocots (68 species), and ferns (12 species). Canga crusts are rich in dicots, several of which play an important role in community structuring, together with the more usual monocot aggregations. Distinct plant communities are found associated to different microhabitats within the iron crust, depending primarily on the amount of soil and moisture retention in the different microtopographies. The environmental uniqueness, high diversity, lack of studies and rapid destruction of these ecosystems pose an immediate challenge for their conservation.'

Abstract: 'Walker & Syers (1976) proposed a conceptual model that describesthe pattern and regulation of soil nutrient pools and availability during long-term soil and ecosystem development. Their model implies that plantproduction generally should be limited by N on young soils and by P on oldsoils; N and P supply should more or less equilibrate onintermediate-aged soils. We tested the application of this model to nutrientlimitation, using a well characterized substrate age sequence in Hawaiianmontane rain forest. Earlier experiments had evaluated nutrient limitationin forests on a young (300 y) and an old (4,100,000 y) substrate on the samedevelopmental sequence; N alone limited tree growth on the youngsubstrate, while P alone did so on the old one. An additional fertilizerexperiment based on replicated treatments with N, P, and all othernutrients combined, applied in individually and in all factorialcombinations, was established in an intermediate-aged site in theLaupahoehoe Forest Reserve, Hawaii. Here, diameter increments of thedominant tree Metrosideros polymorpha increased slightly with Nadditions, and nearly doubled when N and P were added together.Additions of elements other than N and P had no significant effecton growth. These results show that N and P had equilibrated (relativeto plant requirements) in the intermediate aged site. Together withthe earlier experiments, these results suggest that the Walker and Syersmodel provides a useful starting point for explaining the nature anddistribution of nutrient limitation in forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'The impact of disturbance on species diversity may be related to the spatial scales over which it occurs. Here I assess the impact of logging and ENSO (El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation) -induced burning and forest isolation on the species richness (477 species out of more than 28,000 individuals) and community composition of butterflies and butterfly guilds using small (0.9\xc2\xa0ha) plots nested within large (450\xc2\xa0ha) landscapes. The landscapes were located in three habitat classes: (1) continuous, unburned forest; (2) unburned isolates surrounded by burned forest; and (3) burned forest. Plots with different logging histories were sampled within the two unburned habitat classes, allowing for independent assessment of the two disturbance factors (logging and burning). Disturbance within habitat classes (logging) had a very different impact on butterfly diversity than disturbance among habitat classes (due to ENSO-induced burning and isolation). Logging increased species richness, increased evenness, and lowered dominance. Among guilds based on larval food plants, the species richness of tree and herb specialists was higher in logged areas but their abundance was lower. Both generalist species richness and abundance was higher in logged areas. Among habitat classes, species richness was lower in burned forest and isolates than continuous forest but there was no overall difference in evenness or dominance. Among guilds, generalist species richness was significantly lower in burned forest and isolates than continuous forest. Generalist abundance was also very low in the isolates. There was no difference among disturbance classes in herb specialist species richness but abundance was significantly higher in the isolates and burned forest than in continuous forest. Tree specialist species richness was lower in burned forest than continuous forest but did not differ between continuous forest and isolates.'

Abstract: 'The Guinean rain forest (GRF) of West Africa, identified over 20\xc2\xa0years ago as a global biodiversity hotspot, had reduced to 113,000\xc2\xa0km2 at the start of the new millennium which was 18% of its original area. The principal driver of this environmental change has been the expansion of extensive smallholder agriculture. From 1988 to 2007, the area harvested in the GRF by smallholders of cocoa, cassava, and oil palm increased by 68,000\xc2\xa0km2. Field results suggest a high potential for significantly increasing crop yields through increased application of seed-fertilizer technologies. Analyzing land-use change scenarios, it was estimated that had intensified cocoa technology, already developed in the 1960s, been pursued in Cote d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon that over 21,000\xc2\xa0km2 of deforestation and forest degradation could have been avoided along with the emission of nearly 1.4 billion t of CO2. Addressing the low productivity of agriculture in the GRF should be one of the principal objectives of REDD climate mitigation programs.'

Abstract: 'The common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus is an excellent model organism for studying ecological vicariance in the Neotropics due to its broad geographic range and its preference for forested areas as roosting sites. With the objective of testing for Pleistocene ecological vicariance, we sequenced a mitocondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker and two nuclear markers (RAG2 and DRB) to try to understand how Pleistocene glaciations affected the distribution of intraspecific lineages in this bat.'

Abstract: 'Cloud forests are unusual and fragile habitats, being one of the least studied and least understood ecosystems. The tropical Andean dominion is considered one of the most significant places in the world as regards biological diversity, with a very high level of endemism. The biodiversity was analysed in an isolated remnant area of a tropical montane cloud forest known as the \xe2\x80\x9cBosque de Neblina de Cuyas\xe2\x80\x9d, in the North of the Peruvian Andean range. Composition, structure and dead wood were measured or estimated. The values obtained were compared with other cloud forests. The study revealed a high level of forest biodiversity, although the level of biodiversity differs from one area to another: in the inner areas, where human pressure is almost inexistent, the biodiversity values increase. The high species richness and the low dominance among species bear testimony to this montane cloud forest as a real enclave of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Land-use change from forest to cocoa agroforestry and other tree-based farming systems alters the structure of forest stands and influences the magnitude of canopy water fluxes and subsequent bio-element inputs to the forest floor. The partitioning of incident rainfall (IR) into throughfall (TF), stemflow (SF) and canopy interception loss (ILC) and their associated nutrient element concentrations and fluxes was examined along a replicated chrono-sequence: forest, 3, 15 and 30-year-old smallholder shaded-cocoa systems in Ashanti Region, Ghana. Mean annual precipitation during the 2-year observational period (2007 and 2008) was 1376.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa093.8\xc2\xa0mm. TF contributed between 76.5\xe2\x80\x9390.4%, and SF between 1.4\xe2\x80\x931.7% of the annual IR to the forest floor. There were significant differences in IR, TF and SF chemistry. While TF and SF were enriched in phosphorus (1.33\xe2\x80\x935.67-fold), potassium (1.1\xe2\x80\x935.69 fold), calcium (1.35\xe2\x80\x932.65 fold) and magnesium (1.4\xe2\x80\x932.68 fold) relative to IR, total N (NH4 ++NO3 \xe2\x88\x92) declined (0.5\xe2\x80\x930.91) of IR values in TF and SF in forest and shaded cocoa systems. Incident rainfall was significantly more acidic than TF and SF in both forest and shaded-cocoa systems. Mean annual total N, P, K, Ca and Mg inputs to the forest floor through IR were 5.7, 0.14, 13.6, 9.43 and 5.6\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921year\xe2\x88\x921 respectively. Though an important source of available nutrients for plant growth, incident rainfall provides only a small percentage of the annual nutrient requirements. With declining soil fertility and pervasive low cocoa yields, possible effects of the reported nutrient fluxes on nutrient budgets in cocoa systems merit further investigation. Against the background of increased TF and decreased ILC following forest conversion to shaded-cocoa, it is also recommended that more studies be carried out on rainfall partitioning and its impact on ground water recharge as a way of establishing its influence on the availability of moisture for agriculture in these systems.'

Abstract: 'Leaf litter ants are an important group of organisms for informing conservation planning. This study presents the beginning of a leaf litter ant dataset for Guyana. Following the ants of the leaf litter protocol, ants were extracted from sifted leaf litter sampled along eight transects from across Guyana. A total of 230 species were collected from 44 genera. Of those 230 species, 122 species (ca. 53%) were found at only one site. Out of the 122 species found at only one site, 43 species (ca. 19%) were singletons, being known from only one specimen. Using a cluster analysis, faunistic composition was compared among sites. While the lowland sites accounted for the highest species richness, Mt. Ayanganna possessed an especially distinctive ant fauna and may represent a center of endemism. Three leaf litter ant communities were identified: lowland and two Mt. Ayanganna communities, mid-elevation and upper elevation. Recent mining operations on Mt. Ayanganna threaten its pristine nature and this study confirms the need for further biological study of the area. With upwards of 70% of its area still forested Guyana has the opportunity to preserve its biological heritage before widespread deforestation occurs. If expanded, this leaf litter ant dataset will be increasingly useful for country-wide conservation planning.'

Abstract: 'The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or \xe2\x80\x98greenness index\xe2\x80\x99, based on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) aboard the NOAA-7 satellite, has been widely interpreted as a measure of regional to global vegetation patterns. This study provides the first rigorous, quantitative evaluation of global relationships between the NDVI and geographically representative vegetation data-bases, including field metabolic measurements and carbon-balance results from global simulation models. Geographic reliability of the NDVI is judged by comparing NDVI values for different surface types with a general global trend and by statistical analysis of relationships to biomass amounts, net and gross primary productivity, and actual evapotranspiration. NDVI data appear to be relatively reliable predictors of primary productivity except in areas of complex terrain, for seasonal values at high latitudes, and in extreme deserts. The strength of the NDVI-productivity relationship seems comparable to that of earlier climate-based productivity models. Little consistent relationship was found, across different vegetation types, between NDVI and biomass amounts or net biospheric CO2 flux.'

Abstract: 'In September 2000, the self-styled \xe2\x80\x9canthropological journalist\xe2\x80\x9d Patrick Tierney began to make public his work claiming that the Yanomam\xc3\xb6 people of South America had been actively\xe2\x80\x94indeed brutally\xe2\x80\x94harmed by the sociobiological anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon and the geneticist-physician James Neel. Following a florid summary of Tierney\xe2\x80\x99s claims by the anthropologists Terence Turner and Leslie Sponsel, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) saw fit to take Tierney\xe2\x80\x99s claims seriously by conducting a major investigation into the matter. This paper focuses on the AAA\xe2\x80\x99s problematic actions in this case but also provides previously unpublished information on Tierney\xe2\x80\x99s falsehoods. The work presented is based on a year of research by a historian of medicine and science. The author intends the work to function as a cautionary tale to scholarly associations, which have the challenging duty of protecting scholarship and scholars from baseless and sensationalistic charges in the era of the Internet and twenty-four-hour news cycles.'

Abstract: 'The moist forests of southern Bahia, although occupying less than 10% of the original cover, represent one of the last strongholds of lowland forest in eastern Brazil. Friedrich Sellow (1815) and K. F. P. von Martius (1818) were the first botanists to make significant collections in the region, a tradition which has been intensified by the efforts of the staff of the herbarium of the \xe2\x80\x9cCentro de Pesquisas do Cacau\xe2\x80\x9d (CEPEC) from 1965 to the present. The climate is hot and humid with 1200\xe2\x80\x931800 mm of rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year. These conditions are ideal for the cultivation of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), the principal crop of the region. The native forests are related structurally and in taxonomic composition to those of Amazonia and possess a high degree of endemism. Buttresses (17% of the trees), latex (20% of the trees), and mesophyll leaves with entire margins characterize the trees which are present in densities of 891.26 individuals over 10 cm DBH/hectare. Densities, frequencies, dominances, and importance values, based on a study of 600 trees, are given for the 178 species of trees found at a study site located near Buerarema, Bahia. Only 0.3% of the trees studied fell in the 80\xe2\x80\x9389 cm size class whereas 95.5% were in size classes below 50 cm DBH. The forest appears to be stratified into lower, canopy, and emergent layers. Epiphytes (on 80% of trees) and lianas (on 37.5% of trees) are common. Trees flower throughout the year but exhibit a definite peak of flowering in the spring (October to December) which is probably a response to increase in daylength and/or temperature. Leaf fall and leaf flush are also more prevalent in the spring. The five most important families in terms of diversity, density, and dominance are: Myrtaceae, Sapotaceae, Caesalpiniaceae, Lauraceae, and Chrysobalanaceae. A species list, based on the collections of the CEPEC herbarium, is included. Protected areas, in this rapidly disappearing vegetation type, represent only 0.1% of the original forest.'

Abstract: 'Parrots (Order Psittaciformes) are secondary cavity-nesters that depend on existing cavities for nest sites, and consume plant resources of fruits, seeds, and flowers that are highly variable, but little is known of resource selectivity by parrots, or how they deal with variable environments. We reviewed published studies of nest-cavity use by parrots, and those evaluating parrot diet and their relationship with food resources. Most studies have been conducted within the last 20\xc2\xa0years and these present data on resource use for only one-third of parrot species worldwide. However, basic information on resource requirements is lacking for the vast majority of Psittaciformes, particularly for species from the Asian region. Nesting studies have found that parrots use nest cavities in large trees, high above the ground,\xc2\xa0with large nest chambers, of 0.5\xe2\x80\x931\xc2\xa0m deep, and entrance diameters related to body size of the parrot\xc2\xa0species. A few studies demonstrate that parrots select nest sites based on cavity characteristics, which may influence nest success, but a complete evaluation of adaptive nest site selection by Psittaciformes is lacking. Parrots have varied diets and may employ a combination of strategies of diet switching, habitat shifts, and movements to track food resources. This plasticity in diet and foraging strategy may influence the extent to which parrots can respond to anthropogenic pressures of global change. Parrots may also play an important functional role in forest ecosystems, yet little is currently known of plant\xe2\x80\x93animal interactions of parrots, or the impact of parrot populations on forest dynamics. Based on our review of the literature, we suggest that to meet their resource requirements, parrots employ resource selection strategies of hierarchical nest site selection to increase the likelihood of nest success, and plasticity in diet and foraging strategy to track variable food resources. Future studies need to evaluate resource selection and the consequences of this for fitness in order to assess the potential impacts of global change on parrot populations, and to identify characteristics which make species vulnerable to human pressures.'

Abstract: 'Carbon sequestration is increasingly being promoted as a potential response to the risks of unrestrained emissions of CO2, either in place of or as a complement to reductions in the use of fossil fuels. However, the potential role of carbon sequestration as an (at-least partial) substitute for reductions in fossil fuel use can be properly evaluated only in the context of a long-term acceptable limit (or range of limits) to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, taking into account the response of the entire carbon cycle to artificial sequestration. Under highly stringent emission-reduction scenarios for non-CO2 greenhouse gases, 450 ppmv CO2 is the equivalent, in terms of radiative forcing of climate,to a doubling of the pre-industrial concentration of CO2. It is argued in this paper that compliance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (henceforth, the UNFCCC) implies that atmospheric CO2 concentration should be limited, or quickly returned to, a concentration somewhere below 450 ppmv. A quasi-one-dimensional coupled climate-carbon cycle model is used to assess the response of the carbon cycle to idealized carbon sequestration scenarios. The impact on atmospheric CO2 concentration of sequestering a given amount of CO2 that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere, either in deep geological formations or in the deep ocean, rapidly decreases over time. This occurs as a result of a reduction in the rate of absorption of atmospheric CO2 by the natural carbon sinks (the terrestrial biosphere and oceans) in response to the slower buildup of atmospheric CO2 resulting from carbon sequestration. For 100 years of continuous carbon sequestration, the sequestration fraction (defined as the reduction in atmospheric CO2 divided by the cumulative sequestration) decreases to 14% 1000 years after the beginning of sequestration in geological formations with no leakage, and to 6% 1000 years after the beginning of sequestration in the deep oceans. The difference (8% of cumulative sequestration) is due to an eflux from the ocean to the atmosphere of some of the carbon injected into the deep ocean.The coupled climate-carbon cycle model is also used to assess the amount of sequestration needed to limit or return the atmospheric CO2 concentration to 350\xe2\x80\x93400 ppmv after phasing out all use of fossil fuels by no later than 2100. Under such circumstances, sequestration of 1\xe2\x80\x932 Gt C/yr by the latter part of this century could limit the peak CO2 concentration to 420\xe2\x80\x93460 ppmv, depending on how rapidly use of fossilfuels is terminated and the strength of positive climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. To draw down the atmospheric CO2 concentration requires creating negative emissions through sequestration of CO2 released as a byproduct of the production of gaseous fuels from biomass primary energy. Even if fossil fuel emissions fall to zero by 2100, it will be difficult to create a large enough negative emission using biomass energy to return atmospheric CO2 to 350 ppmv within 100 years of its peak. However, building up soil carbon could help in returning CO2 to 350 ppmv within 100 years of its peak. In any case, a 100-year period of climate corresponding to the equivalent of a doubled-CO2 concentration would occur before temperatures decreased. Nevertheless, returning the atmospheric CO2concentration to 350 ppmv would reduce longterm sea level rise due to thermal expansion and might be sufficient to prevent the irreversible total melting of the Greenland ice sheet, collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and abrupt changes in ocean circulation that might otherwise occur given a prolonged doubled-CO2 climate. Recovery of coral reef ecosystems, if not already driven to extinction, could begin.'

Abstract: 'The Atlantic forests of southern Bahia in Brazil present great species richness and a high degree of endemism. A large part of these native forests were transformed into cacao plantations in an agroforestry system known locally as cabrucas, where native trees were culled and cacao was planted under the shade of remaining trees. The present study analyzed the influence of time of implantation (age) and time of abandonment of management practices on tree species diversity of cabruca plantations to evaluate the capacity for conservation and recovery of species richness of native Atlantic Forest trees in cabrucas. Phytosociological surveys were conducted in five cabrucas with different conditions of age and state of abandonment. All trees, including hemiepiphytes and excluding the cacao plants, with a minimum stem diameter of 10\xc2\xa0cm at breast height, were surveyed within a 3-ha sampling area in each plantation. A total of 2514 individual trees belonging to 293 species and 52 families were recorded in the five cabrucas. The Shannon diversity index varied from 3.31 to 4.22 among the cabrucas and was positively correlated with the time of abandonment (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.97). The new cabrucas showed the highest values of estimated total richness (Chao) and the highest proportion of late successional species than the old ones. All areas preserved a very high proportion of native forest species while the three old cabrucas showed a higher proportion of exotic species than the two new ones. Thus the exotic species seem to replace more of the native species in the long run because of management practices and local preferences. The cabrucas presented also a high capacity for the regeneration of tree species richness after abandonment. Simple alterations in management practices could improve the recruitment of late successional species in these areas. Economic incentives may be necessary for the farmers to adopt management practices to retain native species which bring no economic returns.'

Abstract: 'From a total woody flora of ca. 1000 species, a suite of 121 species forms an oligarchy dominating the cerrado biome. This mirrors patterns of dominance described in western Amazonian rain forests. Widespread sampling shows that across the biome this suite of species contributes on average 66% of the total species composition, and 75% of the total Importance Value Index in cerrado communities. An analysis of the floristic similarity between six cerrado phytogeographic provinces (southern, central and south-eastern, central-western, far-western, north-eastern, disjunct Amazonian) reveals great heterogeneity within the biome, principally of the less common species. Of the 951 species recorded from 375 floristic surveys across the biome, 494 species (more than half of the total) are found in only one of the provinces, with very few species (37, i.e., 3.9%) found in all six provinces. Each of the provinces contains a significant number of species which are apparently confined to it, ranging from 15 species (1.6% of the total woody cerrado flora) in the far-western province (primarily in the state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia) to 162 species (17%) in the central-western province. At the local level, floristic similarity can be very high. An analysis of the floristic composition of 13 sites within the Federal District shows a woody flora of 236 species, indicating that 25% of the total woody flora of the cerrado biome is represented in 0.3% of its area, illustrating the great conservation importance of this region. Floristic similarity between sites within the Federal District is high, although much of this similarity is accounted for by \xe2\x80\x98oligarch\xe2\x80\x99 species which account for between 59 and 89% of total species recorded per site. Informed conservation judgements within the cerrado need to take account of regional floristic patterns to ensure maximum protection of biodiversity, as the majority of species are not geographically widespread within the biome.'

Abstract: "It is argued that the Shipibo Indians follow a meat-procurement strategy that (1) takes into account seasonally variable exploitation costs of fishing and hunting, and (2) helps them satisfy their nutritional requirements for meat in a way which minimizes the amount of time they must allocate to meat procurement. To test this idea, linear programming theory is linked with Bergman's ethnographic description of the Shipibo system in order to construct a mathematical model of the Shipibo meat-procurement strategy. Statistical procedures and Bergman's data are used to estimate parameters in the model and the predictions of the model are then compared to observed values. This paper concludes by proposing a conceptual approach to human adaptation which distinguishes cognition from behavior, but interconnects the two in indigenous decision-making."

Abstract: 'The rate and extent to which biophysical resources are captured and utilized by the components of an agroforestry system are determined by the nature and intensity of interactions between the components. The net effect of these interactions is often determined by the influence of the tree component on the other component(s) and/or on the overall system, and is expressed in terms of such quantifiable responses as soil fertility changes, microclimate modification, resource (water, nutrients, and light) availability and utilization, pest and disease incidence, and allelopathy. The paper reviews such manifestations of biophysical interactions in major simultaneous (e.g., hedgerow intercropping and trees on croplands) and sequential (e.g., planted tree fallows) agroforestry systems.'

Abstract: 'Our limited knowledge of the size of the carbon pool and exchange fluxes in forested lowland tropical peatlands represents a major gap in our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Peat deposits in several regions (e.g. the Congo Basin, much of Amazonia) are only just beginning to be mapped and characterised. Here we consider the extent to which methodological improvements and improved coordination between researchers could help to fill this gap. We review the literature on measurement of the key parameters required to calculate carbon pools and fluxes, including peatland area, peat bulk density, carbon concentration, above-ground carbon stocks, litter inputs to the peat, gaseous carbon exchange, and waterborne carbon fluxes. We identify areas where further research and better coordination are particularly needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in estimates of tropical peatland carbon pools and fluxes, thereby facilitating better-informed management of these exceptionally carbon-rich ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infectious disease of global significance. Political, economic, demographic, ecologic, and other anthropogenically driven environmental changes have fueled the reemergence of this disease in industrialized and developing countries, and in both urban and rural settings. We argue that conventional disciplinary, even interdisciplinary, research methods are not sufficient to elucidate the complex mechanisms and causal relationships among the myriad factors responsible for infectious disease emergence. To address the significant gaps in the field of leptospirosis, an integrated research agenda is needed to guide successful public health remediation of the disease. Based on both working group analysis of literature and newly obtained information, we describe cross-disciplinary collaborative approaches that allow a novel approach to understand leptospirosis emergence with regard to mountain-to-sea ecosystems in Hawai\xe2\x80\x98i and other region-specific ecosystems. Leptospirosis research is a model for how complementary disciplines in the social, cultural, ecological, and biomedical sciences can optimally interact towards a higher understanding of emerging infectious diseases.'

Abstract: 'Madre de Dios, a southern state in the Peruvian Amazon basin, has experienced rapid development as well as an influx of migrants since the construction of the Interoceanic Highway (IOH) connecting Brazil, Bolivia, and the Peruvian coast. We explored perceptions of migration and development in up to eight communities along the IOH in Madre de Dios following construction of the highway.'

Abstract: 'Defining the linkages between landscape change, disease ecology and human health is essential to explain and predict the emergence of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria, a zoonotic parasite residing in Southeast Asian macaques, and transmitted by species of Anopheles mosquitos. Changing patterns of land use throughout Southeast Asia, particularly deforestation, are suggested to be the primary drivers behind the recent spread of this zoonotic parasite in humans. Local ecological changes at the landscape scale appear to be increasing the risk of disease in humans by altering the dynamics of transmission between the parasite and its primary hosts. This paper will focus on the emergence of P. knowlesi in humans in Malaysian Borneo and the ecological linkage mechanisms suggested to be playing an important role.'

Abstract: 'The climbing habit has evolved independently in many plant taxa, offering vines the ability to compete with non-climbing vegetation for resources such as light, nutrients, and water. This review examines the structural and functional characteristics that allow climbing plants to (1) achieve widespread dispersal, (2) transport large amounts of water throughout vessels, (3) maintain high photosynthesis levels through a large leaf area to biomass ratio, (4) achieve rapid vertical and horizontal expansion by fast growth rates and various climbing mechanisms and (5) survive and recover from disturbances. Due to the competitive effects of vines on trees, management of vine growth is used to preserve tropical timber plantations, combat invasive weeds, and promote rainforest recovery. In order to sustainably manage the vines into the future, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which they can alter tropical forest succession and the impacts of various management techniques.'

Abstract: 'Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions are affected by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors such as light intensity, temperature, CO2 and drought. Another stress factor, usually overlooked but very important for the Amazon region, is flooding. We studied the exchange of VOCs in relation to CO2 exchange and transpiration of 8 common tree species from the Amazonian floodplain forest grown up from seeds using a dynamic enclosure system. Analysis of volatile organics was performed by PTR-MS fast online measurements. Our study confirmed emissions of ethanol and acetaldehyde at the beginning of root anoxia after inundation, especially in less anoxia adapted species such as Vatairea guianensis, but not for Hevea spruceana probably due to a better adapted metabolism. In contrast to short-term inundation, long-term flooding of the root system did not result in any emission of ethanol or/and acetaldehyde. Emission of other VOCs, such as isoprenoids, acetone, and methanol exhibited distinct behavior related to the origin (igap\xc3\xb3 or v\xc3\xa1rzea type of floodplain) of the tree species. Also physiological activities exhibited different response patterns for trees from igap\xc3\xb3 or v\xc3\xa1rzea. In general, isoprenoid emissions increased within the course of some days of short-term flooding. After a long period of waterlogging, VOC emissions decreased considerably, along with photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance. However, even under long-term testing conditions, two tree species did not show any significant decrease or increase in photosynthesis. In order to understand ecophysiological advantages of the different responses we need field investigations with adult tree species.'

Abstract: 'Forests in lowland Bolivia suffer from severe deforestation caused by different types of agents and land use activities. We identify three major proximate causes of deforestation. The largest share of deforestation is attributable to the expansion of mechanized agriculture, followed by cattle ranching and small-scale agriculture. We utilize a spatially explicit multinomial logit model to analyze the determinants of each of these proximate causes of deforestation between 1992 and 2004. We substantiate the quantitative insights with a qualitative analysis of historical processes that have shaped land use patterns in the Bolivian lowlands to date. Our results suggest that the expansion of mechanized agriculture occurs mainly in response to good access to export markets, fertile soil, and intermediate rainfall conditions. Increases in small-scale agriculture are mainly associated with a humid climate, fertile soil, and proximity to local markets. Forest conversion into pastures for cattle ranching occurs mostly irrespective of environmental determinants and can mainly be explained by access to local markets. Land use restrictions, such as protected areas, seem to prevent the expansion of mechanized agriculture but have little impact on the expansion of small-scale agriculture and cattle ranching. The analysis of future deforestation trends reveals possible hotspots of future expansion for each proximate cause and specifically highlights the possible opening of new frontiers for deforestation due to mechanized agriculture. Whereas the quantitative analysis effectively elucidates the spatial patterns of recent agricultural expansion, the interpretation of long-term historic drivers reveals that the timing and quantity of forest conversion are often triggered by political interventions and historical legacies.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the time allocation decisions of lowland woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha poeppigii) in a terra firma forest in eastern Ecuador where they occur sympatrically with 9 other primate species. Woolly monkeys spent considerable amounts of time searching for and attempting to procure animal prey\xe2\x80\x94roughly as much time as they spent consuming plant material: ripe fruits, leaves, and flowers. The amount of time spent foraging for animal prey is positively related to the habitat-wide availability of ripe fruits (the predominant component of the woolly monkey diet), and negatively related to both ambient temperature and the abundance of potential prey items in the habitat. Time spent resting showed exactly the opposite pattern with respect to these ecological variables. These results suggest that woolly monkeys follow an energy-maximizing strategy of food acquisition during times of fruit abundance\xe2\x80\x94focusing on animal foods and perhaps laying down fat reserves to utilize when ecological conditions worsen\xe2\x80\x94and follow an energy-minimizing strategy when fruit resources are scarce. Such a strong and seasonal commitment to animal prey foraging is unique among the ateline primates and is not ubiquitous even among lowland woolly monkeys. We suggest that this foraging strategy, and the greater intragroup cohesion that characterizes some populations of Lagothrix, are both opportunistic responses to regional differences in habitat quality. Identifying and accounting for such intraspecific variation should be a goal of any analysis of comparative socioecology.'

Abstract: 'Crotalus durissus are found from Mexico to northern Argentina in a highly disjunct distribution. According to some studies, this species is prone to occupy areas disturbed by human activities and floods comprise a plausible method of dispersal as inferred for some North American rattlesnakes. Based on the literature, it seems plausible that Crotalus durissus expanded their natural distribution in Brazil due to floods, but only in a few municipalities in Rio de Janeiro State. Data entries of Butantan Institute, in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, Brazil, from 1998 to 2012 show a declining tendency of snakes brought by donors. In addition, research shows no evidence of Crotalus durissus being an expanding species in the Brazilian territory.'

Abstract: '\nThe response of the six major summer monsoon systems (the North American monsoon, the northern Africa monsoon, the Asia monsoon, the northern Australasian monsoon, the South America monsoon and the southern Africa monsoon) to mid-Holocene orbital forcing has been investigated using a coupled ocean\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere general circulation model (FOAM), with the focus on the distinct roles of the direct insolation forcing and oceanic feedback. The simulation result is also found to compare well with the NCAR CSM. The direct effects of the change in insolation produce an enhancement of the Northern Hemisphere monsoons and a reduction of the Southern Hemisphere monsoons. Ocean feedbacks produce a further enhancement of the northern Africa monsoon and the North American monsoon. However, ocean feedbacks appear to weaken the Asia monsoon, although the overall effect (direct insolation forcing plus ocean feedback) remains a strengthened monsoon. The impact of ocean feedbacks on the South American and southern African monsoons is relatively small, and therefore these regions, especially the South America, experienced a reduced monsoon regime compared to present. However, there is a strong ocean feedback on the northern Australian monsoon that negates the direct effects of orbital changes and results in a strengthening of austral summer monsoon precipitation in this region. A new synthesis is made for mid-Holocene paleoenvironmental records and is compared with the model simulations. Overall, model simulations produce changes in regional climates that are generally consistent with paleoenvironmental observations.'

Abstract: 'Environmental degradation due to mining activities is pervasive in most mineral-rich countries and has been given little attention by the authorities. Surface mining frequently targets very specific and evolutionary unique ecosystems, usually on mountaintops, and is characterized by high environmental impact and irreversibility (Jacobi and do Carmo 2008; Gibson et al. 2010). Recently, the negative impacts of coal surface mining were exposed in relation to ecosystem degradation and damages to human health, underlining the need to improve regulatory measures to mitigate them (Palmer et al. 2010). The loss of plant species associated with mineral-rich areas should be added to the list of ecologic and genetic damages recurrently derived from surface-mining activities.'

Abstract: 'Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, we investigated the patterns of spatiotemporal variation in vegetation coverage and its associated driving forces in the Qinling-Daba (Qinba) Mountains in 2000\xe2\x80\x932014. The Sen and Mann\xe2\x80\x93Kendall models and partial correlation analysis were used to analyze the data, followed by calculation of the Hurst index to analyze future trends in vegetation coverage. The results of the study showed that (1) NDVI of the study area exhibited a significant increase in 2000\xe2\x80\x932014 (linear tendency, 2.8%/10a). During this period, a stable increase was detected before 2010 (linear tendency, 4.32%/10a), followed by a sharp decline after 2010 (linear tendency,\xe2\x80\x936.59%/10a). (2) Spatially, vegetation cover showed a \xe2\x80\x9chigh in the middle and a low in the surroundings\xe2\x80\x9d pattern. High values of vegetation coverage were mainly found in the Qinba Mountains of Shaanxi Province. (3) The area with improved vegetation coverage was larger than the degraded area, being 81.32% and 18.68%, respectively, during the study period. Piecewise analysis revealed that 71.61% of the total study area showed a decreasing trend in vegetation coverage in 2010\xe2\x80\x932014. (4) Reverse characteristics of vegetation coverage change were stronger than the same characteristics on the Qinba Mountains. About 46.89% of the entire study area is predicted to decrease in the future, while 34.44% of the total area will follow a continuously increasing trend. (5) The change of vegetation coverage was mainly attributed to the deficit in precipitation. Moreover, vegetation coverage during La Nina years was higher than that during El Nino years. (6) Human activities can induce ambiguous effects on vegetation coverage: both positive effects (through implementation of ecological restoration projects) and negative effects (through urbanization) were observed.'

Abstract: 'Ex situ seed conservation is an effective strategy to help safeguarding plants from extinction. The updated Global Strategy for Plant Conservation\xe2\x80\x99s (GSPC) Target 8 aims to include 75% of threatened plant species in ex situ collections by 2020, preferably in the country of origin. Halfway through the updated GSPC program, we evaluate the current state of knowledge and practice of ex situ seed conservation of threatened species from megadiverse Brazilian flora, contributing to this Target. We identify knowledge gaps and costs to achieve Target 8 through seed banking in Brazil within the time constraints of the GSPC and in a scenario of recent science budget funding cuts. Knowledge on seed storage behavior is available only for 24 Brazilian species (1.3%). Seed desiccation tolerance was concluded for 175 of 228 species, feasibly allowing safe storage of most Brazilian species at sub-zero temperatures. However, only 26 species (1.3%) are effectively banked in research institutions. Surprisingly, the percentage of banked threatened species hardly increased in the first 5\xc2\xa0years since the update of the Target (0.55%, 2011\xe2\x80\x932015), and Brazil now faces the challenge of banking almost 1500 species during 2016\xe2\x80\x932020. Despite a major lack of commitment of Brazilian institutions and of knowledge to achieve the Target, the costs for banking the remaining species were estimated to be only US$3.9 million. We call for a nationwide coordinated effort of government agencies, policy makers and research institutions to include ex situ seed conservation in the environmental agenda to pursue achievement of the Target by 2020.'

Abstract: 'A modified Bowen ratio (BRm), the sign of which is determined by the direction of the surface sensible heat flux, was used to represent the major divisions in climate across the globe, and the usefulness of this approach was evaluated. Five reanalysis datasets and the results of an offline land surface model were investigated. We divided the global continents into five major BRm zones using the climatological means of the sensible and latent heat fluxes during the period 1980\xe2\x80\x932010: extremely cold, extremely wet, semi-wet, semi-arid and extremely arid. These zones had BRm ranges of (\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9e, 0), (0, 0.5), (0.5, 2), (2, 10) and (10, +\xe2\x88\x9e), respectively. The climatological mean distribution of the Bowen ratio zones corresponded well with the K\xc2\xa8oppen-like climate classification, and it reflected well the seasonal variation for each subdivision of climate classification. The features of climate change over the mean climatological BRm zones were also investigated. In addition to giving a map-like classification of climate, the BRm also reflects temporal variations in different climatic zones based on land surface processes. An investigation of the coverage of the BRm zones showed that the extremely wet and extremely arid regions expanded, whereas a reduction in area was seen for the semi-wet and semi-arid regions in boreal spring during the period 1980\xe2\x80\x932010. This indicates that the arid regions may have become drier and the wet regions wetter over this period of time.'

Abstract: 'The challenges of reducing global hunger and poverty are different today than they were 30\xc2\xa0years ago. Current challenges include price volatility associated with increased integration of food, energy, and finance markets; the steady progression of climate change; poorly defined land institutions; and a failure to break vicious cycles of malnutrition and infectious disease. Farmland speculation is occurring globally\xe2\x80\x94often at odds with rural poverty alleviation\xe2\x80\x94and food insecurity remains a pressing issue with the estimated number of chronically malnourished people hovering around one billion. Given these patterns, food and agriculture are becoming increasingly ingrained in international security and policy discussions. This paper explores several ways in which the traditional field of agricultural development needs to expand to address the broader issues of international security and human welfare. It focuses on five key interrelated issues: the macroeconomic and energy contexts of agricultural development; climate change; deforestation, land access, and land markets; farming systems and technology for the ultra-poor; and food-health linkages with a specific focus on infectious disease. Recommendations for investments in capacity building, revised curricula, and development projects are made on the basis of evidence presented for each issue. It is clear that academic programs, government agencies, development and aid organizations, and foundations need to dismantle the walls between disciplinary and programmatic fields, and to find new, innovative ways to reach real-world solutions.'

Abstract: 'Structural and floristic changes of a fire-protected cerrado sensu stricto are described over a 13-year period. The study site is located in a biological reserve (2,800\xc2\xa0ha) surrounded by large Pinus spp. and Eucalyptus spp. plantations (36,000\xc2\xa0ha), in southwestern Bahia, Brazil. The region occurs in the outer-core of the Cerrado domain, near the Cerrado-Caatinga ecotone, and is mainly occupied by pasture and cropland. Surveys were carried out in 1991 and 2004 in 13 permanent plots (20\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa050\xc2\xa0m). Stems with diameter \xe2\x89\xa55\xc2\xa0cm at 0.30\xc2\xa0m above ground level were identified and measured. Floristic changes were significant (S\xc3\xb8rensen\xc2\xb4s index\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.45). Species number rose from 62 to 84 (35.48%). Alpha diversity increased significantly (P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.001). New species migrated to the area, and there was an expansion of many fire-sensitive species. Woody layer expanded, increasing 19.09% in density and 14.93% in basal area. Diameter distributions followed a \xe2\x80\x9creversed-j\xe2\x80\x9d pattern on both occasions, but differed (P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05) due to a significant increase in the first two size-classes, indicating a high recruitment. Community dynamics was high and had a positive balance between recruitment (3.72%\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921) and mortality (1.93%\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921). Conversely, mean annual increment was very small, 0.096\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921 (SD\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.14; N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0808). Most species, including many dominant ones, had a positive balance in favor of recruitment and low turnover, indicating that although species immigration rate is high (1.42\xc2\xa0spp\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921), structural changes in species composition happens at a much slower pace. The surrounding forest plantations are permeable and do not limit species immigration; and may be connecting the reserve with the larger neighboring natural fragments, providing an abundant source for diaspores, and possibly neutralizing any fragmentation effects. Succession is also influenced by the ecotonal condition. The structure and floristics of the cerrado sensu stricto at this site (under present climatic conditions) is fire-dependent.'

Abstract: 'From June 1994 to October 1995, I conducted a study of the feeding ecology of one group of black-headed uacaris (Cacajao melanocephalus melanocephalus) in Pico da Neblina National Park, Brazil, near the Venezuelan border (01\xc2\xb010\xe2\x80\xb2N to 00\xc2\xb026\xe2\x80\xb2S, 65\xc2\xb003\xe2\x80\xb2W to 66\xc2\xb052\xe2\x80\xb2W). Of a total of 429 feeding records, 89% corresponded to fruits from which black-headed uacaris ate ripe and unripe seeds, mesocarps and arils. Seeds were the single most important food item year-around, corresponding to 81% of the feeding records for fruits. Black-headed uacaris used 120 different plant species in 32 families as food. The 3 most important plant species in their diet, Micrandra spruceana, Eperua leucantha, and Hevea braziliensis (all trees), accounted for 38% of the feeding records for fruits. These species produced fruits that were protected by very hard green husks, were barochorous, did not have fleshy mesocarps, and were slow to mature, thus being available as unripe fruits for long periods. The second and third most important species in the diet of black uacaris, Eperua leucantha and Hevea braziliensis, were dominant in the forest: approximately 30% of trees \xe2\x89\xa510 cm dbh sampled in a 2-ha botanical transect at the study site. I discuss the formation of large social groups of black-headed uacaris in Pico da Neblina National Park in light of the peculiar floristic composition of the study site.'

Abstract: 'This study discusses the role of anti-brand websites and their importance in markets within a new conceptualisation\xe2\x80\x94Negative Double Jeopardy (NDJ): \xe2\x80\x98the most valuable brands attract more anti-brand sites while less valuable brands do not have such hate attraction on the Internet\xe2\x80\x99. In this context, the forms and reasons of anti-brand sites are investigated in light of this newly proposed NDJ phenomenon. NDJ components are identified as \xe2\x80\x98Brand Rank\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Brand Consistency\xe2\x80\x99. Typology of anti-brand sites with regard to NDJ is also studied and finally managerial implications are addressed.'

Abstract: 'This contribution attempts to bring some general information on the evolution and, in particular, on the geographic distribution of scorpion species noxious to humans. Since 95% of the scorpions incidents are generated by specimens of the family Buthidae C. L. Koch, the analysis will be limited to this familial group. As in previous similar contributions, the content of this work is mostly addressed to non-specialists whose research embraces scorpions in several fields such as venom toxins and public health. Only in recent years, efforts have been made to create better links between \xe2\x80\x98academic scorpion experts\xe2\x80\x99 and other academic non-specialists who use scorpions in their research. Even if a larger progress can yet be expected from such exchanges, crossed information proved to be useful in most fields of scorpion studies. Since the taxonomy of scorpions is complex, misidentifications and even more serious errors concerning scorpion classification/identification are often present in the general literature. Consequently, a precise knowledge of the distribution patterns presented by many scorpion groups and, in particular, those of infamous species, proves to be a key point in the interpretation of final results, leading to a better treatment of the problems caused by infamous scorpion species.'

Abstract: "The T'OLCHE' is a protected forest belt about 10\xe2\x80\x9320 m wide that runs through the Mayan landscape on the limits of the maize fields of the farmers. This study explores its traditional use and management and traces how it has changed in the last 30 years in the study village in Yucat\xc3\xa1n, Mexico. A major change is in its extent; little remains of the 10\xe2\x80\x9320% of the area it occupied in the past. Two of the causes of this are identified as being a credit programme of the local bank and 1973 state legislation concerning cattle. The causes and consequences of this decline are discussed in relation with other farmer-perceived changes in overall landuse, including a fall in maize yields. The ecological roles of the T'OLCHE' are examined. It is argued that the T'OLCHE' plays an essential role in the regeneration of the fallow vegetation and in the maintenance of biological diversity. The case of the T'OLCHE' suggests the need for a diversified and politicized look on Common Property Resource Management."

Abstract: 'Tropical forests represent repositories of medicinal plant species and indigenous ethnomedical knowledge. These biotic and cognitive resources are threatened by forest removal and culture change. It has, however, yet to be demonstrated quantitatively that tropical pharmacopoeias are concentrated in primary as opposed to disturbed forests, nor that folk ethnomedical knowledge is disappearing. I examined these questions by means of a useful species enumeration of 1-hectare primary and secondary forest plots, and a survey of the regional plant pharmacopoeia of the Atlantic forests of Bahia, Brazil, a region that has witnessed significant human and biological modification.'

Abstract: "A number of researchers have suggested that polyculture is characteristic of native tropical forest swiddens and have adduced theory from community ecology to account for its adaptiveness. Ye'kwana and Yanomam\xc3\xb6 swidden cultivation is examined, and it is shown that polyculture is not practiced to any significant degree. Instead, the concept of polyvariety is introduced along with a number of other cultivation practices that more simply account for the adaptiveness of Ye'kwana and Yanomam\xc3\xb6 gardening. In addition, comparative data from other parts of the tropical world indicate that polyculture is no more common than monoculture and recent advances in ecological research indicate that the diversity-stability hypothesis that underpins adaptive arguments of polyculture is in need of drastic revision."

Abstract: 'Species distribution models (SDMs) are helpful for understanding actual and potential biogeographical traits of organisms. These models have recently started to be applied in the study of fossil xenarthrans. SDMs were generated for 15 South American late Pleistocene xenarthrans: eight Cingulata (Glyptodon clavipes, Doedicurus clavicaudatus, Panochthus tuberculatus, Neosclerocalyptus paskoensis, Pampatherium typum, Pampatherium humboldtii, Holmesina paulacoutoi, and Holmesina occidentalis) and seven Folivora (Glossotherium robustum, Lestodon armatus, Mylodon darwinii, Catonyx cuvieri, Catonyx (=Scelidodon) chilensis, Megatherium americanum, and Eremotherium laurillardi). Models were evaluated for three periods: the last interglacial (LIG), the last glacial maximum (LGM), and the Holocene climatic optimum (HCO). Co-occurrence records were studied based on the overlap of the potential distributions and compared with the available biome reconstructions of South America during the LGM to analyze species distribution patterns, ecological requirements, and possible interactions. Our results suggest the existence of provincialization within xenarthran megamammals grouped in at least three bioregions. Northern and southwestern taxa overlap in the R\xc3\xado de la Plata region where also some endemic taxa are found. We observed overlapping potential distributions but separated and continuous realized distributions between closely related xenarthrans suggesting competitive exclusion. A generalized reduction in potential habitats at the end of the Pleistocene was not obvious as some taxa show stable potential areas during HCO when comparing with LGM. Nonetheless, fragmentation of the most suitable areas due to climate variation and the impact of reduction in available land due to sea level changes cannot be ruled out as involved in the extinction.'

Abstract: 'Use of mercury (Hg) for gold-mining in French Guiana (up until 2006) as well as the presence of naturally high background levels in soils, has led to locally high concentrations in soils and sediments. The present study maps the levels of Hg concentrations in river sediments from five main rivers of French Guiana (Approuague River, Comt\xc3\xa9 River, Mana River, Maroni River and Oyapock River) and their tributaries, covering more than 5 450\xc2\xa0km of river with 1 211 sampling points. The maximum geological background Hg concentration, estimated from 241 non-gold-mined streams across French Guiana was 150\xc2\xa0ng\xc2\xa0g-1. Significant differences were measured between the five main rivers as well as between all gold-mining and pristine areas, giving representative data of the Hg increase due to past gold-mining activities.'

Abstract: 'The effects of irrigation on fine root biomass, root production and litterfall were measured at the community level, in a semideciduous lowland forest in Panama. Biomass of roots less than 2 mm in dia. in the first 10 cm of the soil (measured with soil cores), was higher in irrigated (1.80 Mg ha-1) than in non-irrigated plots (1.24 Mg ha-1). During the dry season, productivity of roots (measured with ingrowth cylinders filled with root-free soil), was higher in irrigated (1.6 g m-2 day-1) than in control plots (0.3 g m-2 day-1). In control plots, root productivity was highly seasonal. Maximum root growth into the root-free soil, occurred during the transitions from dry to wet, and from wet to dry season, possibly as a response to water and/or nutrient pulses. Litterfall was not significantly different between irrigated (3.8 g m-2 day-1) and control plots (3.7 g m-2 day-1). The results of this study show that root-productivity is limited by the water supply during the dry season, and that water by itself, is not a limiting factor for community-level litter production.'

Abstract: "Predicting and redressing the threat of species extinction is not a success story. The science of estimating extinction rates and risk prediction is approached in a manner that is difficult to apply in the field, and yet current integrated ecosystem management programmes in many parts of the world, which are trying to place the conservation of species into sustainable community projects, need predictive tools for planning land use programmes. Such programmes involve US$100s of millions of multilateral and bilateral aid; many predicated on a site's biodiversity importance, the risks of extinction, sustainable extraction, production forms of land use, community livelihoods, water, and many others factors, but increasingly on ensuring that after the pump-priming funds are finished the programmes are both environmentally and economically sustainable (Swingland 2002, 2003, 2004; Swingland et\xc2\xa0al. 2003).

Since most species extinction is anthropocentric, research on species extinction needs to be more accessible and focussed on global problems."

Abstract: 'Yields of total fixed nitrogen and nitrogen fractions are summarized for thirty-one watersheds in which anthropogenic disturbance of the nitrogen cycle, either through land use or atmospheric deposition, is negligible or slight. These yields are taken as representative of background conditions over a broad range of watershed areas, elevations, and vegetation types. The data set focuses on watersheds of the American tropics, but also includes information on the Gambia River (Africa) and some small watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California. For the tropical watersheds, total nitrogen yield averages 5.1 kg ha \xe2\x88\x921 y\xe2\x88\x921. On average, 30% of the total is particulate and 70% is dissolved. Of the dissolved fraction, an average of 50% is organic and 50% is inorganic, of which 20% is ammonium and 80% is nitrate. Yields are substantially lower than previously estimated for background conditions. Yields of all nitrogen fractions are strongly related to runoff, which also explains a large percentage of variance in yield of total nitrogen (r2 = 0.85). For total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions, yield increases at about two-thirds the rate of runoff; concentration decreases as runoff increases. There is a secondary but significant positive relationship between elevation and yield of DIN. Ratios DON/TDN and PN/TN both are related to watershed area rather than runoff; DON/TDN decreases and PN/TN increases toward higher stream orders. The analysis suggests for tropical watersheds the existence of mechanisms promoting strong homeostasis in the yield of N and its fractions for a given moisture regime, as well as predictable downstream change in proportionate representation N fractions. Yields and concentrations for small tropical watersheds are much larger than for the few temperate ones with which comparisons are possible.'

Abstract: 'Biogeographic studies in Amazonia typically describe biodiversity across interfluvia, rarely within them, where geographic variability in morphological traits might be observed. We tested for intraspecific phenotypic variation in three bird species within the Purus\xe2\x80\x93Madeira interfluvium (Central Amazon) and whether phenotypes were correlated with environmental heterogeneity or geographic distance among sites. We compared coloration indexes derived from reflectance spectra and morphometrics of up to five adult individuals of each sex among 11 sites within the interfluvium and contrasted them with proxies for geographic distance and environmental variation (tree basal area and bird community). Environmental heterogeneity was minimally spatially autocorrelated, and there were no obvious geographical barriers to dispersal in the study region. The null hypothesis was that we would see either no phenotypic variation or random variation that was not explained by the tested variables. Half of the cases analyzed showed intraspecific morphological variation. Coloration varied more frequently than morphometrics, and color was better explained by environmental heterogeneity, particularly in males, whereas brightness also varied with geographic distance. Geographic distance explained the only case of variation in morphometrics. Our results indicate that coloration, particularly plumage brightness, is more labile than morphometric traits and that plumage color might be under stronger effects of local adaptation than brightness, which also seems to be under effects of neutral drift and gene flow among populations. Higher frequencies of association between male coloration and the environment suggest a role of non-arbitrary mechanisms of sexual selection on the expression of male phenotypes, whereas arbitrary intersexual selection might explain the randomly distributed variation that is not explained by environmental heterogeneity or geographic distance. We revealed intraspecific phenotypic variation in a spatial extent usually not considered in biogeographic studies in the Amazon and demonstrate that both local adaptation and neutral drift are important to explain intraspecific trait diversification at this geographical scale.'

Abstract: 'A study of the feeding habits of the fish stock of a gently sloping marginal zone of Plover Cove Reservoir, Hong Kong, has been carried out. Analysis of the stomach contents of five species of fish revealed that, after a rise in water level which led to the inundation of considerable quantities of terrestrial vegetation, such plants were the major dietary item of the animals collected. This finding was consistent whether the points, occurrence or dominance methods of gut content analysis were used. Additionally, statistical analysis of these data strongly suggested that the fish migrated into the marginal zone to feed upon the flooded material thus raising the possibility that these animals are normally food limited. A discussion of the findings of this study indicated that the fish in Plover Cove Reservoir played an important role as agents of transmission and conversion of the input of allochthonous carbon compounds from the surrounding terrestrial environment.'

Abstract: "'Greenhouse gases', especially carbon dioxide, are intimately connected to climate change. To understand the future evolution of the climate system and find ways to manage the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the processes and feedbacks that drive the carbon cycle must first be understood. However, our current knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns is uncertain, particularly over land and in regions of potentially high sensitivity to change like the boreal zone. The European Space Agency (ESA) GLOBCARBON project aims to generate fully calibrated estimates of at-land products quasi-independent of the original Earth Observation source for use primarily in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, but also as a contribution to the Global Carbon Project, a cooperation between the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme, International Human Dimensions Programme and the World Climate Research Programme to aid understanding of global carbon cycling. The service will feature estimation of global burned area, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), leaf area index (LAI) and Vegetation Growth Cycle. The demonstrator will focus on ten complete years, from 1998 to 2007 when overlap exists between ESA Earth Observation sensors and others that are synergistic. However, the system will be flexible so that it is not dependent on any single satellite sensor and therefore can be retrospectively applied to existing archives and used with future satellite sensors."

Abstract: 'We used a microsatellite enriched library to isolate and characterize 12 di-nucleotide microsatellite loci of Caiman crocodilus. Microsatellites were characterized in populations of C. c. crocodilus from Piaga\xc3\xa7u-Purus, Amazonas, Brazil and C. c. yacare from C\xc3\xa1ceres, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Results of characterization were comparable between the two subspecies, with number of alleles varying from three to 20 and one to 14 per locus in C. c. crocodilus and C. c. yacare, respectively. Observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.088 to 0.816 and 0.115 to 0.833, respectively. Joint paternity exclusion (QC) was\xc2\xa0>0.999 in both subspecies, and probability of genetic identity varied from 4.631\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x9213 in C. c. crocodilus to 2.233\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x928 in C. c. yacare. All loci are unlinked, and with the exception of three loci in C. c. crocodilus all loci were at Hardy\xe2\x80\x93Weinberg equilibrium. The characteristics of these loci makes them an excellent tool set for the study of mating systems, and fine-scaled population structuring in the Caiman crocodilus species complex.'

Abstract: 'In spite of the many advances in land use and land cover change modelling over the past decade many challenges remain. One of these challenges relates to the explicit treatment of feedback mechanisms in descriptive models of the land use system. This paper argues for model-based analysis to explore the role of feedback mechanisms as determinants of land use dynamics and system evolution. Different types of feedbacks in the land use system are discussed addressing interactions over scales of analysis, feedbacks between impacts and driving forces of land use change and feedbacks between agents and land units. The inclusion of feedbacks in land use models will require new methods for model parameterization and calibration, but will ultimately increase our understanding of land use system dynamics.'

Abstract: 'The present paper describes Heliconius hermathena curua Freitas & Ramos ssp. nov. This subspecies exhibits a non-mimetic phenotype typical of H. hermathena, but is characterized by the merging of the yellow streak over the forewing cubitus with the red postmedian band in the dorsal forewing. The subspecies is known from two localities in the south of Altamira, Par\xc3\xa1 State, Brazil, where it inhabits an isolated patch of \xe2\x80\x9ccampina\xe2\x80\x9d vegetation more than 600\xc2\xa0km from the nearest known H. hermathena populations. Geographic isolation of the population is supported by molecular data; based on the mitochondrial gene COI, all individuals of H. hermathena curua ssp. nov. form a monophyletic group and all haplotypes found in it are unique, suggesting that gene flow is not currently on-going. Given the fragile situation of Amazonian white sand forests and the proximity of the population to areas of intensive agriculture, this new subspecies and its habitat deserve attention.'

Abstract: 'Little is known about deep soil heterogeneity, or its relationship with fine root distribution. Beneath a mature, closed-canopy forest of eastern Amazonia, and the pastures and secondary forests that are derived from this forest, soil soft spots and hollow chambers occur to at least 9 meters depth. We measured the vertical distribution of these soil patches, and compared chemical characteristics, mycorrhizal infection, and root density of soil soft spots with the surrounding matrix of more homogeneous soil. Soil soft spots and chambers varied little with depth, but occupied the greatest soil volume (0.8 to 1.2%) from 4 to 6 m depth in the mature forest. Soft spots had lower pH, P availability and arbuscular mycorrhizal infection, and higher K availability than surrounding soil. Root length density was 2 to 15 times higher in soft spots than in surrounding soil. In the pastures, roots were found only in soil soft spots at depths of >3 m. Pastures and secondary forest had more soil chambers in the upper meter of soil than mature forest, but were otherwise indistinguishable in their patterns of deep soil heterogeneity. Soil soft spots may be vestiges of cutter ant nest chambers, while hollow chambers are cutter ant chambers and root channels. Chambers may act as conduits for root penetration and water penetration to deep soil.'

Abstract: 'The major Neotropical malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi, was reintroduced into the Iquitos, Loreto, Peru area during the early 1990s, where it displaced other anophelines and caused a major malaria epidemic. Since then, case numbers in Loreto have fluctuated, but annual increases have been reported since 2012.'

Abstract: 'Diaptomid copepods are prevalent throughout continental waters of the Neotropics, yet little is known about their biogeography. In this study we investigate the main biogeographical patterns among the neotropical freshwater diaptomid copepods using Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) based on species records within ecoregions. In addition, we assess potential environmental correlates and limits for species richness.'

Abstract: 'While the amount of reactive nitrogen circulating at the global level has increased markedly in the last century, the effects of this increase are largely seen at the regional level due to interacting ecological and socio-economic factors. In contrast with most other regions of the world, Latin America and the Caribbean (LA-Ca) stand out due to the fact that the major input of reactive nitrogen (Nr) still occurs naturally via biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in natural ecosystems as opposed to anthropogenic inputs of synthetic fertilizer, fossil fuel combustion and cropping with leguminous species. Largely due to economic reasons, the consumption of fertilizer N in the LA-Ca region is still low in comparison with the average consumption of the world. However, the fertilizer N consumption is increasing at a much faster rate than that in developed regions of the world, like USA and Canada. The Nr production through BNF in cultivated plants that fix nitrogen (C-BNF) is 5 times lower than that occurring naturally in Latin America, but is still equivalent to 16% of the world C-BNF. The cultivation of nitrogen-fixing crop species in the LA-Ca region is also increasing, almost entirely due to the expansion of soybean fields in the central and northern regions of Brazil and the Pampa region of Argentina. Other anthropogenic activities in the region that contribute to an increase in the circulation of reactive nitrogen include the impact of biomass burning and urbanization. In the last decade, an average of 47,000\xc2\xa0km2 per year of forests was burned in the LA-Ca region. The environmental impact of urban centers in the LA-Ca region has become very important, since an intense urbanization process is occurring in this region, at an intensity that far exceeds urban development in the northern hemisphere. The consequences of increased urbanization include increased emissions of NO x  to the atmosphere due to the fossil fuel combustion, and the lack of sewage treatment facilities in most cities of the LA-Ca result in a large volume of untreated sewage discharged into surface waters, creating serious environmental problems. The combination of rapid urbanization and agricultural intensification in this region suggest that concern is warranted for the potential for increase in the circulation of reactive nitrogen in the very near future. At the same time, the opportunity still exists to mitigate some of the consequences of human impact on the nitrogen cycle in a region that still maintains a large fraction of its natural ecosystems intact.'

Abstract: 'During the 1997/98 ENSO (El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation) event more than 5 million ha of East Kalimantan, Indonesia burned. Here we quantify the initial stages of regeneration (19982001), both in forest that burned and in unburned controls. Sapling and seedling density and species richness remained significantly lower in burned than in unburned forest and community composition remained substantially different between both forest types throughout the sampling period. The only pronounced edge effect was a significantly higher density of seedlings in the interior of unburned forest. Sapling density increased and seedling density declined in both unburned and burned forest during the four-year study period. In the unburned forest, sapling and seedling species richness remained stable, but sapling species richness declined significantly with time in the burned forest. The pioneer community in the burned forest was, furthermore, characterised by higher growth and recruitment than in the unburned forest but mortality did not differ between both forest types. Differences in environment (burned versus unburned: 2965% of variation explained) and the distance between sample sites (1323% of variation explained) explained substantial amounts of variation in sapling and seedling community similarity. Similarity was, however, only marginally (< 1% explained) related to the edge position and temporal variation (difference among sample events). Our results, four years after the initial burn, indicate that burned forest still differed greatly from unburned forest in terms of density, species richness and community composition. There was also no clear trend of a return to pre-disturbance conditions, which indicates that the burned forest may remain in a severely degraded state for a prolonged period of time.'

Abstract: 'This study presents the utility of remote sensing (RS), GIS and field observation data to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) and stem volume over tropical forest environment. Application of those data for the modeling of forest properties is site specific and highly uncertain, thus further study is encouraged. In this study we used 1460 sampling plots collected in 16 transects measuring tree diameter (DBH) and other forest properties which were useful for the biomass assessment. The study was carried out in tropical forest region in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The AGB density was estimated applying an existing DBH \xe2\x80\x94 biomass equation. The estimate was superimposed over the modified GIS map of the study area, and the biomass density of each land cover was calculated. The RS approach was performed using a subset of sample data to develop the AGB and stem volume linear equation models. Pearson correlation statistics test was conducted using ETM bands reflectance, vegetation indices, image transform layers, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bands, Tasseled Cap (TC), Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features and DEM data as the predictors. Two linear models were generated from the significant RS data. To analyze total biomass and stem volume of each land cover, Landsat ETM images from 2000 and 2003 were preprocessed, classified using maximum likelihood method, and filtered with the majority analysis. We found 158\xc2\xb116 m3\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 of stem volume and 168\xc2\xb115 t\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 of AGB estimated from RS approach, whereas the field measurement and GIS estimated 157\xc2\xb192 m3\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 167\xc2\xb194 t\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 of stem volume and AGB, respectively. The dynamics of biomass abundance from 2000 to 2003 were assessed from multi temporal ETM data and we found a slightly declining trend of total biomass over these periods. Remote sensing approach estimated lower biomass abundance than did the GIS and field measurement data. The earlier approach predicted 10.5 Gt and 10.3 Gt of total biomasses in 2000 and 2003, while the later estimated 11.9 Gt and 11.6 Gt of total biomasses, respectively. We found that GLCM mean texture features showed markedly strong correlations with stem volume and biomass.'

Abstract: 'Soil, an important component of land, has numerous functions and ecosystem services essential to all terrestrial life. Soil degradation, decline in its capacity to support functions and provide ecosystem services, is caused by accelerated erosion, salinization, elemental imbalance, acidification, depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC), reduction in soil biodiversity, and decline in soil structure and tilth. Desertification, a sub-set of degradation, specifically refers to decline in soil quality and functions in arid climates. Climate change affects and is affected by soil degradation through a positive feed back due to increase in mineralization of SOC pool and the radiative forcing. Desertification may lead to a net increase in temperature despite change in albedo of the denuded surface. Feedbacks and threshold amplify the risks of degradation, and the projected climate change may exacerbate all four types of drought (i.e., meteorological, hydrological, pedagogical, and ecological). The mutually reinforcing positive feedbacks between soil degradation and climate change are strongly influenced by social, economic, political, and cultural factors. There exists a strong link between poverty, desperateness, and societal collapse on soil degradation and climate change. Restoration of degraded and desertified soils, converting marginal agricultural areas to rangeland and forest land, and adoption of recommended management practices have a large technical potential to sequester carbon and off-set anthropogenic emissions, improve the environment, and enhance and sustain agronomic productivity. Important among recommended management practices are using conservation agriculture and mulch farming, establishing cover crops, adopting strategies of integrated nutrient management, and those which create positive C and nutrient budgets and soil/water conservation within a watershed. Long-term research is needed which is hypothesis-driven, uses modern innovative research and modeling tools, is based on community involvement, and provides decision support systems to policy makers and land managers.'

Abstract: 'Advances in forensic identification using molecular genetics are helpful in resolving some historical mysteries. The aim of this study was to confirm the authenticity of shrunken-head artifacts exhibited by two Polish museums. Shrunken heads, known as tsantsas, were headhunting trophies of South American Indians (Jivaroan). A special preparation preserved their hair and facial appearance. However, it was quite common to offer counterfeit shrunken heads of sloths or monkeys to collectors of curiosities. We sampled small skin specimens of four shrunken-head skin from the museum collection from Warsaw and Krakow, Poland. Following genomic DNA isolation, highly polymorphic short tandem repeats were genotyped using a commercial chemistry and DNA sequencing analyzer. Haplogroups of human Y chromosome were identified. We obtained an informative genetic profile of genomic short tandem repeats from all the samples of shrunken heads. Moreover, amplification of amelogenin loci allowed for sex determination. All four studied shrunken heads were of human origin. In two ones, a shared Y-chromosome haplogroup Q characteristic for Indigenous Americans was detected. Another artifact was counterfeited because Y-chromosome haplogroup I2 was found, characteristic for the Southeastern European origin. Commercial genetic methods of identification can be applied successfully in studies on the origin and authenticity of some unusual collection items.'

Abstract: "Tree species composition (diameter at breast height (dbh) \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm) was studied in primary, selectively logged and heavily burnt forests in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The number of trees, tree species, and the Fishers's-\xce\xb1 diversity index were determined for the first 15 years (burnt forest) and 25 years (selectively logged forest) after disturbance. Additionally the population structure of six common and typical Macaranga pioneer tree species was compared through time between selectively logged, burnt and primary forest. Both selectively logged and burnt forest showed a significant reduction in number of trees and tree species per surface area directly after disturbance. Fire especially affected dominant tree species, while for selective logging the opposite was observed. In selectively logged forest the number of trees, tree species and the Fishers's-\xce\xb1 index reached pre-disturbance levels within c. 15 years. For burnt forest, only the number of trees recovered to pre-disturbance levels. The number of tree species stayed constant after disturbance, while the Fishers's-\xce\xb1 index decreased. The six studied Macaranga pioneer tree species seedlings were present in all forest types. Their density seems to be unrelated to light levels in the forest understorey but strongly related to the number of mature parent trees. Their sapling densities were strongly related to light levels in the forest understorey. The studied Macaranga species formed an important part of both under- and over-storey in burnt forest 15 years after disturbance, while they were almost absent in the understorey and only moderately common in the overstorey of selectively logged forest."

Abstract: 'There are hardly any data available on the relationships between the parasite and the vector or regarding potential reservoirs involved in the natural transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Tropics of Cochabamba, Bolivia. Local families from communities were responsible for the capture of triatomine specimens, following a strategic methodology based on entomological surveillance with community participation developed by the National Chagas Programme of the Ministry of Health of Bolivia.'

Abstract: ' Fevillea is a small neotropical liana genus of the Cucurbitaceae that is well known ethnobotanically as having seeds with purgative and emetic properties. We report here the unusually high oil content of its seeds, first called to our attention by their use as candles by the Campa Indians in Amazonian Peru.Fevillea fruits apparently have a higher seed oil content than do those of any other dicotyledon. We suggest that, if the naturally occurring lianas in an uncut rainforest were all replaced byFevillea vines producing at normal levels, a per hectare oil yield comparable to those obtained in the most productive oil-seed plantations might be expected\xe2\x80\x94without cutting a single tree. DifferentFevillea species have different seed-oil compositions and different ecological requirements, suggesting that appropriate breeding and agronomic development could lead to their use as new oil crops grown under a wide variety of tropical situations.'

Abstract: 'Yields of total fixed nitrogen and nitrogen fractions are summarized for thirty-one watersheds in which anthropogenic disturbance of the nitrogen cycle, either through land use or atmospheric deposition, is negligible or slight. These yields are taken as representative of background conditions over a broad range of watershed areas, elevations, and vegetation types. The data set focuses on watersheds of the American tropics, but also includes information on the Gambia River (Africa) and some small watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California. For the tropical watersheds, total nitrogen yield averages 5.1 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 y\xe2\x88\x921. On average, 30% of the total is particulate and 70% is dissolved. Of the dissolved fraction, an average of 50% is organic and 50% is inorganic, of which 20% is ammonium and 80% is nitrate. Yields are substantially lower than previously estimated for background conditions. Yields of all nitrogen fractions are strongly related to runoff, which also explains a large percentage of variance in yield of total nitrogen (r2=0.85). For total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions, yield increases at about two-thirds the rate of runoff; concentration decreases as runoff increases. There is a secondary but significant positive relationship between elevation and yield of DIN. Ratios DON/TDN and PN/TN both are related to watershed area rather than runoff; DON/TDN decreases and PN/TN increases toward higher stream orders. The analysis suggests for tropical watersheds the existence of mechanisms promoting strong homeostasis in the yield of N and its fractions for a given moisture regime, as well as predictable downstream change in proportionate representation N fractions. Yields and concentrations for small tropical watersheds are much larger than for the few temperate ones with which comparisons are possible.'

Abstract: 'The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo or DRC) has some of the most fertile soils in Africa to cultivate cacao, an important cash crop and source of income for many smallholder farmers. Although cacao is currently produced there on small scale, DRC has the potential to grow as a cacao-producing country, thereby supplying the increasing cacao demand in the global market. Since the introduction of cacao varieties in the late nineteenth century, selection and breeding experiments have been carried out based on phenotype, without any knowledge on the genetic background of the cultivars. Therefore, this study analyzes 62 Congolese accessions of the Centre de Recherche de Yangambi (CRY) and 51 accessions of international collections representing 10 reference groups and Trinitario cultivars using 14 microsatellite markers. Descriptive statistics revealed a high\xc2\xa0gene diversity and polymorphic information content (PIC) for most of the markers, of which mTcCIR 12, 37, and 60 were the most discriminative. Both Bayesian clustering and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed high-admixed ancestry of the CRY cultivars. The collection was divided in two clusters, of which the first formed a hybrid population, linked to Amelonado, Trinitario, Mara\xc3\xb1\xcf\x8cn, and Nanay, and the second was assigned to predominantly Amelonado, followed by Nanay, Contamana, and Nacional. This high\xc2\xa0admixture level resulted from numerous hybridization and recombination events that took place in the previous century. The obtained knowledge is essential for efficient conservation, utilization, and selection of high-quality cacao cultivars, which are agronomical favored, disease resistant, and of superior flavor quality.'

Abstract: 'Squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp.) are widely distributed in the Amazon basin. This study describes the ecological and behavioral patterns of two social groups of S. sciureus in forests adjacent to the Tucuru\xc3\xad hydroelectric reservoir in eastern Amazonia, including range size, activity budgets, and composition of the diet. The groups were monitored at Base 4 (group B4) and Germoplasma Island (group GI). Quantitative behavioral data were collected using instantaneous scan sampling to record behavior, substrate use, and height. Home ranges were delimited using a GPS to determine group position after each 50\xc2\xa0m of movement. Home ranges were 75.0\xc2\xa0ha for group B4 (39 members) and 77.5\xc2\xa0ha for group GI (32 members). The use of vertical strata was well defined, with a marked preference for the middle and lower levels of the canopy. The activity budgets of both groups were typical of those of other squirrel monkeys and were dominated by foraging (B4\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa048.7\xc2\xa0%; GI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa049.6\xc2\xa0%), moving (both groups 28.9\xc2\xa0%), and feeding (B4\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa014.6\xc2\xa0%; GI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa012.4\xc2\xa0%). Resting was rare (B4\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa03.5\xc2\xa0%; GI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02.6\xc2\xa0%) and less common than social behavior (B4\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04.3\xc2\xa0%; GI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06.4\xc2\xa0%). The diet of both groups was dominated by plant material (B4\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa070.7\xc2\xa0% of feeding records; GI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa071.4\xc2\xa0%), which is in contrast with the more insectivorous diets recorded for Saimiri at other sites. Group GI spent more time foraging during the dry season, whereas group B4 spent more time in the rainy season when the consumption of fruit increased (significantly, in the case of group GI). The less insectivorous diet of these groups may be due to a number of factors, including the unique habitat configuration at the site and reduced hydrological stress due to the proximity of the reservoir.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation is a major environmental challenge in the mountain areas of Pakistan. The study assessed trends in the forest cover in Chitral tehsil over the last two decades using supervised land cover classification of Landsat TM satellite images from 1992, 2000, and 2009, with a maximum likelihood algorithm. In 2009, the forest cover was 10.3% of the land area of Chitral (60,000 ha). The deforestation rate increased from 0.14% per annum in 1992\xe2\x80\x932000 to 0.54% per annum in 2000\xe2\x80\x932009, with 3,759 ha forest lost over the 17 years. The spatial drivers of deforestation were investigated using a cellular automaton modelling technique to project future forest conditions. Accessibility (elevation, slope), population density, distance to settlements, and distance to administrative boundary were strongly associated with neighbourhood deforestation. A model projection showed a further loss of 23% of existing forest in Chitral tehsil by 2030, and degradation of 8%, if deforestation continues at the present rate. Arandu Union Council, with 2212 households, will lose 85% of its forest. Local communities have limited income resources and high poverty and are heavily dependent on non-timber forest products for their livelihoods. Continued deforestation will further worsen their livelihood conditions, thus improved conservation efforts are essential.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines how structure and agency interact to shape forced migration outcomes. Specifically, I ask how structural factors such as compensation policies as well as social, financial, and human capital may either foster or constrain migration aspirations and capabilities. I use longitudinal, semi-structured interview data to study forced migration among farmers displaced by the Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon. Results from baseline interviews indicate that nearly all community members aspired to purchase rural land in the region and maintain livelihoods as cacao farmers or cattle ranchers. Constraints limiting the ability to attain aspirations included strict requirements on land titles for properties, delays in receiving compensation, rising land prices, and the lack of power to negotiate for better compensation. Despite these constraints, most migrants succeeded in attaining aspirations, as they were able to mobilize resources such as social networks, financial capital, skills, and knowledge. These findings highlight the importance of considering the relationship between structure and agency within forced migration research. I conclude by discussing how the findings may inform resettlement policies for future cases of development- or environment-induced forced migration.'

Abstract: 'In the Neotropics, differences in phytogeographic patterns and species richness respond non-randomly to edaphic factors in many upland forests. However, whether wetland forests follow the same species differentiation patterns is not well known. In this paper we analyze the relationship among species occurrences and selected soil characteristics, particularly salinity and acidity, in several wetland plant communities. Plant specimens were collected and soil samples analyzed for exchangeable cations, chloride, and organic carbon. Statistical methods were applied to assess \xce\xb2-diversity and to detect relationships between patterns of floristic variation and spatial variations of the soil conditions. \xce\xb2-diversity was high among vegetation communities. Edaphic conditions were heterogeneous, and landward gradients were present only for salinity and some exchangeable bases. This resulted in a lack of a straightforward relationship of vegetation patterns to salinity. More than 30% of the reported species covaried with at least one of the three acidity-related variables, suggesting that some tolerance to deleterious effects of H+ and Al3+ at pH values < 4 is likely. Thus, in contrast to what we might expect in deltaic regions, acidity rather than salinity was the major factor driving species organization. However, variation of these soil characteristics taken together accounted for only 40% of floristic differences among communities.'

Abstract: 'We used the natural abundance of 15N in soils in forests, pastures and cultivated lands in the Menagesha and Wendo-Genet areas of Ethiopia to make inferences about the N cycles in these ecosystems. Since we have described the history of these sites based on variations in 13C natural abundance, patterns of \xce\xb415N and \xce\xb413C values were compared to determine if shifts of 15N correlate with shifts of vegetation. At Menagesha, a > 500-yr-old planted forest, we found \xce\xb415N values from \xe2\x88\x928.8 to +3.5\xe2\x80\xb0 in litter, from \xe2\x88\x923.5 to +4.5\xe2\x80\xb0 in 0\xe2\x80\x9310 cm soil layer, and from \xe2\x88\x921.5 to +6.8\xe2\x80\xb0 at >20 cm soil depth. The low \xce\xb415N in litter and surface mineral soils suggests that a closed N cycle has operated for a long time. At this site, the low \xce\xb413C of the surface horizon and the high \xce\xb413C of the lower soil horizons is clear evidence of a long phase of C4 grass dominance or cultivation of C4 crops before the establishment of the forest >500 years ago. In contrast, at Wendo-Genet, high \xce\xb413C of soils reveals that most of the land has been uncovered by forests until recently. Soil \xce\xb415N was high throughout (3.4\xe2\x80\x939.8\xe2\x80\xb0), and there were no major differences between forested, cultivated and pasture soils in \xce\xb415N values of surface mineral soils. The high \xce\xb415N values suggest that open N cycles operate in the Wendo-Genet area. From the points of view of soil fertility management, it is interesting that tall forest ecosystems with relatively closed N cycling could be established on the fairly steep slopes at Menagesha after a long period of grass vegetation cover or cultivation.'

Abstract: 'In order to provide guidelines for the management of fish stocks in artificial reservoirs in the Amazon region, the present study analyzed the composition and structure of the fish communities of four sectors (upstream, lake, reservoir, and downstream) of the area affected by the Coaracy Nunes hydroelectric reservoir on the Araguari River in the Brazilian state of Amap\xc3\xa1. Variation in ecological parameters was analyzed in the context of the impacts suffered since the damming of the river approximately 40\xc2\xa0years ago. Standardized samples of fish were collected in gillnets during eight campaigns in 2009 and 2010. Abundance and biomass were initially evaluated by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and lognormal, log-series, geometric series, and broken stick models were then calculated. The K-dominance and Abundance-Biomass (ABC) curves were also analyzed, together with the size-spectrum of the specimens. The results indicated that the sector downstream from the dam had the highest species richness, and was most consistent with the broken stick model. The ABC and K-dominance analyses also confirmed that this sector was the most balanced, in ecological terms. The lake sector had the only community that fitted the geometric series model, and all the analyses indicated a predominance of small individuals, typical of impacted communities. The analyses of the reservoir sector indicated a disturbed environment, whereas the upstream sector was characterized by a more balanced community, reflecting its greater resilience to the impacts caused by the reservoir, and its potential of this area for the conservation of local fish communities. The results also confirmed the applicability of the analytical tools employed for the study of fish communities in reservoir environments.'

Abstract: 'Drought is the major abiotic stress limiting cocoa seedling survival during establishment. The level of genetic variation and relationship among traits related to drought tolerance were examined in a 6\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa06 incomplete diallel and 8\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa03 incomplete factorial mating designs for parents of diverse genetic groups. Thirty-eight families, 23 from the diallel and 15 from the factorial mating were evaluated in 2012/13 major dry season under shade and no-shade locations. Six-month old seedlings were planted in a randomized complete block design with two replications consisting of 24 plants per plot. Traits related to drought tolerance including stem growth, percentage survival, leaf chlorophyll content and plant vigour were monitored. Analysis of the 38 families showed highly significant (P\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa00.01) variation for families, replications, locations and location\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0family interaction for most of the traits. Preponderance of additive effects was manifested in terms of significant GCA when genetic analysis of the diallel was performed. Heritability was moderate to high (h 2b\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.43\xe2\x80\x930.63) for broad sense and low to moderate (h 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.25\xe2\x80\x930.57) for narrow sense. Clones PA 13 and AMAZ 15/15 had positive GCA effects, whereas PA 150 and T60/887 had negative GCA effects for most traits. The highest genotypic correlations were between survival and vigour. Results from the study indicate that there is considerable genetic variation for traits related to drought tolerance in the available germplasm, and the families of some specific clones are able to survive droughts under typical field conditions in Ghana.'

Abstract: ' Biomass collapse and its associated microclimatic stresses within recently isolated rain forest fragments may negatively affect species diversity of most resident taxa. However, for some decomposer organisms, increased resource availability via accompanying tree die-off may effect positive responses, at least  for a time, with implications for rates of nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas release. This study investigates the early effects of forest fragmentation on a Neotropical termite assemblage. Numbers of encounters (surrogate for relative abundance) and species richness of wood and leaf-litter feeders, soil feeders, and the whole assemblage, were studied across true forest islands and mainland sites at a hydroelectric reservoir in French Guiana. Results showed no overall effect of fragmentation on either total termite encounters or species richness. However, numbers of encounters and species richness of wood and leaf-litter feeders showed positive responses to forest fragmentation. By contrast, soil feeders showed a negative response for numbers of encounters and no significant effect for species richness. Environmental data suggest that increased tree die-off, and other edge effects associated with biomass collapse, were underway at the time of sampling. Resulting increase in resource availability may therefore explain the positive influence on wood and leaf-litter feeders. A possible decrease in predation pressure from ants with decrease in island size was not tested for, but was a likely effect of the flooded matrix habitat. Fragmentation effects on soil feeder encounters may be due to the energetic and microclimatic constraints of feeding lower down the humification gradient of termite food substrates, but were not sufficient to affect species richness. The patterns revealed suggest that rates of wood decomposition following tree die-off, and of soil nutrient cycling, under different rain forest fragmentation scenarios, merit further study.'

Abstract: 'Mayaro virus is endemic in South America and sporadic outbreaks have been described. It causes a dengue-like febrile illness accompanied by severe and long-lasting polyarthralgias. Outside endemic regions, however, the disease is not well known and can be misdiagnosed as dengue. International travellers are at risk to acquire Mayaro virus and due to increased worldwide travel infectious disease specialists need to be aware of such rare clinical entities.'

Abstract: 'During 2009, while we were celebrating Charles Darwin and his The origin of species, sadly, little was said about the critical contribution of Alfred Russel Wallace (1823\xe2\x80\x931913) to the development of the theory of evolution. Like Darwin, he was a truly remarkable nineteenth century intellect and polymath and, according to a recent book by Roy Davies (The Darwin conspiracy: origins of a scientific crime), he has a stronger claim to the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection than has Darwin. Here we present a critical comparison between the contributions of the two scientists. Sometimes referred to as \xe2\x80\x98The other beetle-hunter\xe2\x80\x99 and largely neglected for many decades, Wallace had a far greater experience of collecting and investigating animals and plants from their native habitats than had Darwin. He was furthermore much more than a pioneer biogeographer and evolutionary theorist, and also made contributions to anthropology, ethnography, geology, land reform and social issues. However, being a more modest, self-deprecating man than Darwin, and lacking the latter\xe2\x80\x99s establishment connections, Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the theory of evolution was not given the recognition it deserved and he was undoubtedly shabbily treated at the time. It is time that Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Darwin is reconsidered in preparation for 2013, the centenary of Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s death, and he should be recognized as at least an equal in the Wallace-Darwin theory of evolution.'

Abstract: 'The physical and mechanical properties of wood affect the growth and development of trees, and also act as the main criteria when determining wood usage. Our understanding on patterns and controls of wood physical and mechanical properties could provide benefits for forestry management and bases for wood application and forest tree breeding. However, current studies on wood properties mainly focus on wood density and ignore other wood physical properties. In this study, we established a comprehensive database of wood physical properties across major tree species in China. Based on this database, we explored spatial patterns and driving factors of wood properties across major tree species in China. Our results showed that (i) compared with wood density, air-dried density, tangential shrinkage coefficient and resilience provide more accuracy and higher explanation power when used as the evaluation index of wood physical properties. (ii) Among life form, climatic and edaphic variables, life form is the dominant factor shaping spatial patterns of wood physical properties, climatic factors the next, and edaphic factors have the least effects, suggesting that the effects of climatic factors on spatial variations of wood properties are indirectly induced by their effects on species distribution.'

Abstract: 'The Tierras Bajas regions of eastern Santa Cruz, Bolivia have undergone among the most rapid rates of concentrated deforestation during the 1980s and 1990s. We investigate the sensitivity of local climate to these land cover changes as observed from Landsat images acquired between 1975 and 1999. The Simple Biosphere model (SiB2) is used to assess the effects of both morphological and physiological changes in vegetation and the implications for fluxes of water, energy and carbon between the vegetation and the atmosphere during the rainy season.'

Abstract: 'We review the key determinants of health in Ucayali, Peru, identified by researchers, and, according to these, propose a set of tools to improve health in this area. Women and indigenous peoples are recognized as two vulnerable groups in the region that face greater health risks, and these are the main focus of the development of tools for health improvement. Also, the growing economic integration in the region facilitates the spread of infectious disease, thus requiring several levels of intervention. The tools discussed to improve health in Ucayali cross several scales and sectors. They include improved natural resource management, education and empowerment of women, integration of traditional and biomedical care, improved health information management, and community mobilization for health. Overall, our conclusions reinforce the limitations of the biomedical approach, which focuses on the treatment of specific pathologies in improving health. Health-system development requires the cooperation of many sectors and many actors across several spatial scales.'

Abstract: ' Anopheles darlingi is considered the most efficient malaria vector in the Neotropical region.

Abstract: 'While completing this special issue, a ruptured BP oil well, lying on the sea bed in the Gulf of Mexico, has been spilling oil, polluting and destroying fauna and flora, and affecting more than 100\xc2\xa0miles of shoreline in Louisiana. Declared the worst ecological disaster in US history, the damage is compounded by the chemical dispersants used to neutralise the slick: more than 3.5\xc2\xa0m litres of chemicals, combined with crude oil, are posing a severe threat to public health (Goldenberg 2010). The crisis began on 20 April 2010, with the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig about 50\xc2\xa0miles off the coast of Louisiana which caused the death of eleven workers (a human tragedy which media reports strangely downplayed). BP can be blamed for incompetence, fraudulent sidestepping of safety rules, or for hiring unprofessional contractors to carry out some extraction and maintenance operations but, as is common in cases of corporate crime and deviance, the broader attribution of \xe2\x80\x98blame\xe2\x80\x99 and identification of \xe2\x80\x98cause\xe2\x80\x99 are complicated matters. More critical commentators have also blamed US political and business interests, seduced by the cheap petrol and high tax provided by BP while the oil industry\xe2\x80\x99s major safety watchdog (Minerals Management Service, now renamed Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) has been accused of bending to the power of the industry and failing to regulate drilling and other operations: \xe2\x80\x98Halting offshore operations of any particular company would improve safety, but reduce tax revenues by $13bn annually\xe2\x80\x99 (Macalister 2010). Ultimately however, it is consumer addiction to oil that provides the background to this disaster. As the US imports 10\xc2\xa0m barrels of oil a day it is doubtful that any US administration is going to seriously undermine the operations and profitability of the oil industry and talk of needing to know \xe2\x80\x98whose ass to kick\xe2\x80\x99, as President Obama put it on NBC News in June, is unlikely to characterise the long-term relationship between government and big oil. Given America\xe2\x80\x99s dependency on both imported foreign crude as well as domestic sources drawn from ever-riskier drilling locations, future relations will inevitably be more harmonious than this.'

Abstract: 'The occurrence of seasonal growth rings in the wood of Campsiandra laurifolia, Acosmiun nitens, Pouteria orinocoensis and Psidium ovatifolium, common species growing in the flooding forest of the Mapire river, was analyzed using wood anatomy and ring- width analysis. The test of the annual ring formation was performed using radiocarbon analysis based on the nuclear weapon effect. All species showed growth rings visible to the naked eye. The ring boundaries in all cases were marked by bands of marginal parenchyma. The index ring-width curves of the four studied species showed a strong relationship with the fluctuation of the water river level during the non flooded months, suggesting that an increase in the water level during these months positively influenced the growth indicating that the rings were formed on an annual basis. The content of radiocarbon in the wood of anatomically predated rings of Campsiandra laurifolia and Pouteria orinocoensis confirm these results. All studied trees are slow growing with less than 2.5 mm annual increment.'

Abstract: 'Odonata have been widely used as indicators for the biomonitoring of terrestrial and aquatic habitats due to their sensitivity to environmental impacts. We aimed to determine whether the larval or adult phases of these insects were the best predictors of variation in habitat parameters and the loss of environmental integrity. Specimens were collected during three seasons (dry, rainy, and ebb) from 12 points in the Sui\xc3\xa1-missu River basin, at the headwaters of the Xingu River in Mato Grosso, Brazil. The Protest analysis indicated a high degree of congruence between the assemblages of larvae and adults in streams with varying degrees of habitat integrity (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.832, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001, m 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.307). When the congruence with environmental factors was analyzed, a significant association was found only for the larval phase (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.318, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.03, m 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.888). When the suborders were analyzed separately, congruence was confirmed for anisopteran adults (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.338, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.031, m 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.885) and larvae (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.417, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.003, m 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.826) and for the zygopteran adults (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.345, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.027, m 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.881) and larvae (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.405, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.011, m 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.836). These results indicate that both larvae and adults respond systematically to environmental impacts. We suggest that either life phase can be used for biomonitoring, given their effectiveness for the interpretation of disturbance in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. These findings further reinforce the effectiveness of this insect order for the detection of modifications to the environment, showing that they are good indicators of environmental conditions.'

Abstract: 'This study evaluates biotic responses, using ants as bio-indicators, to relatively recent anthropogenic disturbances to mature forest in central Amazonia. The structure of the ground-foraging ant community was compared in four habitats that represented a gradient of disturbance associated with differences in land use. Ants were collected in undisturbed, mature forest, in an abandoned pasture, in a young regrowth forest (situated in a former pasture area), and in an old regrowth forest (established where mature forest was just cleared and abandoned). More ant species were found in mature and old regrowth forest than in the abandoned pasture. By contrast, ant abundance tended to decrease with forest maturity. Both pasture and young regrowth forest exhibited a distinct ant species composition compared to mature forest, whereas species composition in the old regrowth forest showed greater similarity to that of mature forest. In spite of differences in fallow time between former pasture areas and non-pasture areas, there is evidence that different land-management practices do result in different rates of recovery of the ant forest fauna after land abandonment. In any case, recuperation of the ground-foraging ant fauna appears to be faster than regeneration of the woody-plant community. In this sense, regrowth forests may be valuable for the conservation of ground-foraging ants and perhaps for other components of mature-forest leaf-litter fauna within the context of a fragmented landscape.'

Abstract: 'The possibility that escape or evasive mimicry evolved in butterflies and other prey insects in a similar fashion to classical Batesian and M\xc3\xbcllerian mimicry has long been advanced in the literature. However, there is a general disagreement among lepidopterists and evolutionary biologists on whether or not escape mimicry exists, as well as in which mimicry rings this form of mimicry has evolved. Here, we review some purported cases of escape mimicry in Neotropical butterflies and suggest new mimicry rings involving several species of Archaeoprepona, Prepona, and Doxocopa (the \xe2\x80\x9cbright blue bands\xe2\x80\x9d ring) and species of Colobura and Hypna (the \xe2\x80\x9ccreamy bands\xe2\x80\x9d ring) where the palatability of butterflies, their ability to escape predator attacks, geographic distribution, relative abundance, and co-occurrence in the same habitats strongly suggest that escape mimicry is involved. In addition, we also indicate other butterfly taxa whose similarities of coloration patterns could be due to escape mimicry and would constitute important case studies for future investigation.'

Abstract: 'Recent exceptional growth in human exposure to natural products known to originate from traditional medicine has lead to a resurgence of scientific interest in their biological effects. As a strategy for improvement of the assessment of their pharmacological and toxicological profile, scientific evidence-based approaches are being employed to appropriately evaluate composition, quality, potential medicinal activity and safety of these natural products. Using this approach, we comprehensively reviewed existing scientific evidence for known composition, medicinal uses (past and present), and documented biological effects with emphasis on clinical pharmacology and toxicology of two commonly used medicinal plants from South America with substantial human exposure from historical and current global use: Uncaria tomentosa (common name: cat\xe2\x80\x99s claw, and Spanish: u\xc3\xb1a de gato), and Lepidium meyenii (common name: maca). Despite the geographic sourcing from remote regions of the tropical Amazon and high altitude Andean mountains, cat\xe2\x80\x99s claw and maca are widely available commercially in industrialised countries. Analytical characterisations of their active constituents have identified a variety of classes of compounds of toxicological, pharmacological and even nutritional interest including oxindole and indole alkaloids, flavonoids, glucosinolates, sterols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbolines and other compounds.'

Abstract: "We found several populations of wild Oryza species in the lowlands of Costa Rica. The plants showed extensive morphological variation, suggesting the presence of several species. In the morphologic study, 33 traits were scored for plants of all the species. A principal component analysis revealed the significant morphological separation of the different species. The analyses indicated that there are three species, O. grandi\xc2\xadglumis, O. latifolia and O. glumaepatula. Two putative hybrid types were found, both significantly differing in their morphology from the known species and intermediate at several traits. O. grandi\xc2\xadglumis is a new record for Costa Rican flora. Its main population is located in Ca\xc3\xb1o Negro Wildlife Refuge, Los Chiles, Alajuela. O. latifolia is distributed throughout the lowlands of the country and the plants of the Atlantic slope are significantly bigger in general habit than those of the Guanacaste area. During this study a population of O. glumaepatula of hundreds of thousands of plants was discovered in the Medio Queso River wetland, Los Chiles, Alajuela. This population is the most important source of genes for cultivar's improvement from the primary gene pool of rice in Costa Rica. The small ligule and the wide flag leaf characteristic of the two CCDD species separated them from the AA diploid O. glumaepatula. Seed size, ligule size, number of branches in the panicle, plant height and sterile lemma length are all bigger in O. grandi\xc2\xadglumis, and influenced the second factor that separated the CCDD species in two discrete clusters. The species found offer great possibilities for the improvement of rice cultivars and they should be thoroughly studied and appropriately protected."

Abstract: 'In Colombia for several years, the Urab\xc3\xa1-Bajo Cauca and Alto Sin\xc3\xba region has registered the highest numbers of malaria cases in the country. Malaria vector incrimination and the characterization of entomological parameters will allow for a better understanding of malaria transmission dynamics and the design of effective vector control strategies for this region.'

Abstract: 'Progress in scene understanding requires reasoning about the rich and diverse visual environments that make up our daily experience. To this end, we propose the Scene Understanding database, a nearly exhaustive collection of scenes categorized at the same level of specificity as human discourse. The database contains 908 distinct scene categories and 131,072 images. Given this data with both scene and object labels available, we perform in-depth analysis of co-occurrence statistics and the contextual relationship. To better understand this large scale taxonomy of scene categories, we perform two human experiments: we quantify human scene recognition accuracy, and we measure how typical each image is of its assigned scene category. Next, we perform computational experiments: scene recognition with global image features, indoor versus outdoor classification, and \xe2\x80\x9cscene detection,\xe2\x80\x9d in which we relax the assumption that one image depicts only one scene category. Finally, we relate human experiments to machine performance and explore the relationship between human and machine recognition errors and the relationship between image \xe2\x80\x9ctypicality\xe2\x80\x9d and machine recognition accuracy.'

Abstract: 'The particle size characteristics of suspended sediment are of fundamental importance in understanding its role in a variety of environmental processes. Existing knowledge concerning the spatial and temporal variability of the grain size composition of suspended sediment is, however, relatively limited. At the global scale, major contrasts may exist between individual rivers in the calibre of their suspended load and this may be related to a number of controls including climate, catchment geology and basin scale. Any attempt to understand the precise relationship between the grain size characteristics of suspended sediment and those of its source material must also take account of the selectivity of erosion and delivery processes. A local case study undertaken by the authors in the 1500 km2 basin of the River Exe in Devon, UK is used to illustrate the considerable spatial variability that may occur within a relatively small area and the complexity of the associated controls.'

Abstract: 'The mythical concept of an impoverished tropical cladoceran fauna is refuted. On a planetary scale, around half of the cladoceran species presently known occur exclusively in the tropics-subtropics, often with considerable restriction to particular geographical subzones. On a regional (political) scale, the situation is often unclear because of the continued fragmentary nature of studies, and because political units are not a good basis for biogeographical comparisons. At the finest level of resolution (lake-perlake comparisons), there appears to be an upper limit of c. 50 cladoceran species per individual lake. No significant difference between lakes in the temperate zone and in the tropics could be established here. Daphnia is largely absent from the tropics, but is replaced by more Sidids, Moinids, and Bosminids, such that the average cladoceran community in the limnetic zone of a tropical lake is not characterized by less species but rather by lower population densities. This, in turn, is considered a consequence of higher prevalent predation levels in the tropics.'

Abstract: 'Malaria is the direct cause of approximately one million deaths worldwide each year, though it is both preventable and curable. Increasing the understanding of the transmission dynamics of falciparum and vivax malaria and their relationship could suggest improvements for malaria control efforts. Here the weekly number of malaria cases due to Plasmodium falciparum (1994\xe2\x80\x932006) and Plasmodium vivax (1999\xe2\x80\x932006) in Per\xc3\xba at different spatial scales in conjunction with associated demographic, geographic and climatological data are analysed.'

Abstract: 'This study examines the process of land use change in South Florida. Through this discussion, a conceptual model of ecological transition is developed and presented. The model is built on the general principles of neoclassical economic theories of land rent, behavioral models of resource use, and an historical geographic account of environmental change. Central to the paper is the specification of the theoretical link between demographics, market and service demands, land use, and ecological change. This study focuses on the nature and drivers of environmental change that has occurred in South Florida since 1900. The region studied includes the southern Florida Everglades and the surrounding area. The analysis determines that massive land useland cover has taken place in the region, particularly since the end of World War II. These landscape changes are conceptualized by a model that links regional demand for both agricultural and residential land through the agency of hierarchical forces. In this model, landscape evolution and natural areas encroachment are articulated as a dynamic process in which the regime of interaction between human systems and land use changes. Three main time periods for regional ecological transition are defined: (1) frontier closure (2) articulation of a system of cities with coupled agricultural hinterlands serving national and international markets. Differing land use change dynamics are identified as specific to each time period.'

Abstract: "During a field study in northeastern Peru, the reactions of a group ofSaguinus mystax on Padre Isla and of a mixed-species troop ofS. mystax andSaguinus fuscicollis at the R\xc3\xado Blanco to raptorial and other birds were observed. Alarms that are specific to flying stimuli were elicited by birds of prey, but other birds that do not represent a threat to the tamarins also caused alarm calls. Alarm events (i.e., instances when one or more alarm calls were given) were observed at rates of 0.3/hr (Padre Isla) and 0.5/hr (R\xc3\xado Blanco). Rates of alarm events significantly increased after the birth of an infant in the Padre Isla group and after the attack of an ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus) on the R\xc3\xado Blanco group. Reactions to alarming stimuli/alarm calls ranged from looking up to falling down from trees. The modification of the tamarins' behavior by the potential presence of aerial predators indicates that raptors represent an important predatory threat to tamarins."

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82The objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of two N fertilizers, (NH4)2SO4 and urea, for rice (Oryza sativa L.) and rye-grass (Lolium multiflorum L.) cultivated in an Ultisol of central Amazonia using 15N as a tracer. Rice was cultivated in the field, while rye-grass was grown in a phytotron. Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 caused a 16% increase in the yield of rice grains and urea a 36% increase. In both crops total N uptake and N use efficiency of the fertilizers were higher for urea than for (NH4)2SO4. The low values for N derived from fertilizer showed that the fertilizers contributed little to the total N absorbed by the plants. The "priming effect" or positive added N interaction (ANI) between the fertilizer N and soil organic N was observed, especially with urea. Immobilization by soil microorganisms was greater in the presence of urea, while losses were always higher with the (NH4)2SO4 treatments. These losses were significant, and their reduction should allow more efficient use of this N fertilizer. It is possible that the N use efficiency was higher for urea due to a pH increase, caused by urea hydrolysis, which in turn may have favoured the activity of nitrifying bacteria in this extremely acid soil.'

Abstract: 'The practice of integrating western and traditional indigenous medicine is fast becoming an accepted and more widely used approach in health care systems throughout the world. However, debates about intercultural health approaches have raised significant concerns. This paper reports findings of five case studies on intercultural health in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Suriname. It presents summary information on each case study, comparatively analyzes the initiatives following four main analytical themes, and examines the case studies against a series of the best practice criteria.'

Abstract: 'Carbon isotope ratios of the main stem in trees, saplings, and seedlings were correlated with their main stem diameter in an Amazonian seasonal forest. This correlation became the basis of using carbon isotope ratios of roots from various levels of the soil profile in order to determine root distribution from emergent, canopy and subcanopy trees, saplings and herbaceous understorey plants. It was observed that the distribution of roots in the soil profile is horizontally and vertically heterogeneous. Pockets of roots from saplings or herbaceous understorey plants were found as deep as 4 m and pockets of roots from emergent trees were found as shallow as 1 m depth.'

Abstract: 'The conservation of individual plant and animal species has been advanced greatly by the World Conservation Union\xe2\x80\x99s (IUCN) development of objective, repeatable, and transparent criteria for assessing extinction risk, which explicitly separate the process of risk assessment from priority-setting. Here we present an analogous procedure for assessing the extinction risk of terrestrial ecosystems, which may complement traditional species-specific risk assessments, or may provide an alternative when only landscape-level data are available. We developed four quantitative risk criteria, derived primarily from remotely sensed spatial data, information on one of which must be available to permit classification. Using a naming system analogous to the present IUCN species-specific system, our four criteria were: (A) reduction of land cover and continuing threat, (B) rapid rate of land cover change, (C) increased fragmentation, and (D) highly restricted geographical distribution. We applied these criteria to five ecosystems covering a range of spatial and temporal scales, regions of the world, and ecosystem types, and found that Indonesian Borneo\xe2\x80\x99s lowland tropical forests and the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest were Critically Endangered, while South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s grasslands and Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Mato Grosso were Vulnerable. Furthermore, at a finer grain of analysis, one region of Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s coastal dry forests (Margarita Island) qualified as Vulnerable, while another (the Guasare River watershed) was Critically Endangered. In northern Venezuela, deciduous forests were classified as Endangered, semi-deciduous forests Vulnerable, and evergreen forests of Least Concern. We conclude that adoption of such a standardized system will facilitate globally comparable, repeatable geographic analyses that clearly separate risk assessment (a fundamentally scientific process), from the definition of conservation priorities, which should take into account additional factors, such as ecological distinctiveness, costs, logistics, likelihood of success, and societal preferences.'

Abstract: 'Previous studies show that Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variations may help to explain the observed long-term drought during April\xe2\x80\x93May\xe2\x80\x93June (AMJ) since the 1990s over Central equatorial Africa (CEA). However, the underlying physical mechanisms for this drought are still not clear due to observation limitations. Here we use the AMIP-type simulations with 24 ensemble members forced by observed SSTs from the ECHAM4.5 model to explore the likely physical processes that determine the rainfall variations over CEA. We not only examine the ensemble mean (EM), but also compare the \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d ensemble members to understand the intra-ensemble variability. In general, EM and the \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d ensemble member can simulate the drought and associated reduced vertical velocity and anomalous anti-cyclonic circulation in the lower troposphere. However, the \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d ensemble members cannot simulate the drought and associated circulation patterns. These contrasts indicate that the drought is tightly associated with the tropical Walker circulation and atmospheric teleconnection patterns. If the observational circulation patterns cannot be reproduced, the CEA drought will not be captured. Despite the large intra-ensemble spread, the model simulations indicate an essential role of SST forcing in causing the drought. These results suggest that the long-term drought may result from tropical Indo-Pacific SST variations associated with the enhanced and westward extended tropical Walker circulation.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines possible relationships between demographic processes and the environment in rural areas in developing countries. Evidence is reviewed on increasing degradation in the forms of deforestation (of highland forests as well as lowland forests), soil erosion and soil desiccation. The conceptual framework considers changes in demographics as well as economic behaviour being induced by population growth and increasing pressures upon the land, but the focus here is on economic changes in the form of land extensification\xe2\x80\x94often involving internal migration\xe2\x80\x94and land intenstification. Despite data problems, the expected relationships are observed: countries with higher rural population growth tend to have larger increases in the arable land area and associated deforestation, but the intensification effects appear stronger. The paper concludes with implications for policy and further research.'

Abstract: 'This paper reports on possible effects of selective logging on vegetation structure and its consequences for two tenrec species in a dry forest in western Madagascar. On a small scale semi-mechanized logging of less than 10 m3 per ha alters forest structure significantly. However on a large scale most of these changes are smaller than the variation of forest structure due to natural causes. The most profound ecological effect of logging is a reduction in the number of woody species in the regenerating cohort of trees. Potential longterm consequences of this feature are discussed. Microhabitat variables influencing the habitat utilization of two tenrec species,Echinops telfairi andTenrec ecaudatus, were identified in an area of unlogged forest. The conclusions derived from this analysis were then tested in other parts of the forest which had been modified by selective logging. Logging of the extent described above slightly impairs habitats forE. telfairi but has no effect onT. ecaudatus. Though the latter species is hunted extensively in the logged areas, loggingper se does not threaten the survival of either species.'

Abstract: 'Conversion of pristine forests to agricultural lands is one of the leading causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. To assess the impact of such forest disturbance on microbial diversity, we investigated the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the rich forests of Karbi Anglong hills of Assam, a biodiversity hotspot part of Indo-Burma region. AMF spore diversity was assessed in distinct study sites with different intensities of disturbances that encompassed a pristine undisturbed forest (UF), slash-and-burn field (SBF), and monoculture forest (MF). A total of 35 arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal species belonging to 9 genera were isolated. Species forming glomoid spores were dominant in all the three sites followed by acaulosporoid spores. Highest spore density was found in UF and lowest in MF. Multivariate analyses revealed similarity in UF and SBF. It was found that in MF, AMF diversity was significantly modified and reduced, resulting in an ecological degraded ecosystem. Our results show that natural UF and SBF contained similar and a high AM fungal diversity. The AM fungal diversity is not significantly affected by the slash-and-burn agricultural land use practices practised by the ethnic hilly tribes and, therefore, could be a component of a tropical forest \xe2\x80\x9cconservation-agriculture matrix.\xe2\x80\x9d Also because of the high generic and species diversity found, this region can be considered as AMF hotspot and a priority place for conservation.'

Abstract: " We studied two species of Ceratogymna hornbills, the black-casqued hornbill, C. atrata, and the white-thighed hornbill, C. cylindricus, in the tropical forests of Cameroon, to understand their movement patterns and evaluate their effectiveness as seed dispersers. To estimate hornbill contribution to a particular tree species' seed shadow we combined data from movements, determined by radio-tracking, with data from seed passage trials. For 13 individuals tracked over 12\xc2\xa0months, home range varied between 925 and 4,472\xc2\xa0ha, a much larger area than reported for other African avian frugivores. Seed passage times ranged from 51 to 765\xc2\xa0min, with C. atrata showing longer passage times than C. cylindricus, and larger seeds having longer gut retention times than smaller seeds. Combining these data, we estimated that seed shadows were extensive for the eight tree species examined, with approximately 80% of seeds moved more than 500\xc2\xa0m from the parent plant. Maximum estimated dispersal distances for larger seeds were 6,919 and 3,558\xc2\xa0m for C. atrata and C. cylindricus, respectively. The extent of hornbill seed shadows suggests that their influence in determining forest structure will likely increase as other larger mammalian dispersers are exterminated."

Abstract: 'Several studies have been conducted in the past on carbon stock measurements in the tropical forests of Indonesia. This study is the first related research conducted in the New Guinea Island. In a degraded logged-over secondary forest in Manokwari Regency (West Papua, Indonesia), carbon stocks were measured for seven parts, i.e., above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB), under-storey biomass (B u), necromass of dead leaves (N l), necromass of dead trees (N t), litter (L) and soil (S) using appropriate equations and laboratory analysis. Total carbon stocks were measured at 642.8 tC\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 in the low disturbance area, 536.9 tC\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 in the moderate disturbance area and 490.4 tC\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 in the high disturbance area. B u, N l and N t were not significant in the carbon stock and were collectively categorized as a total biomass complex. The carbon stock of litter was nearly equal to that of the total biomass complex, while the total carbon stock in the soil was eight times larger than the total biomass complex or the carbon stock of the litter. We confirmed that the average ratio of AGB and BGB to the total biomass (TB) was about 84.7% and 15.3%, respectively. Improvements were made to the equations in the low disturbance logged-over secondary forest area, applying corrections to the amounts of biomass of sample trees, based on representative commercial trees of category one. TB stocks before and after correction were estimated to be 84.4 and 106.7 tC\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, indicating that these corrections added significant amounts of tree biomass (26.4%) during the sampling procedure. In conclusion, the equations for tree biomass developed in this study, will be useful for evaluating total carbon stocks, especially TB stocks in logged-over secondary forests throughout the Papua region.'

Abstract: 'We argue that thematic resolution, i.e., the level of categorical detail of a thematic map expressed by the number of classes included in the map legend, is an inherent component of the scale at which a landscape is analyzed. Changing the number of classes can change the configuration of the patch mosaic as much as changing the grain does. We address recent calls in this and other journals to deepen research in this topic. In particular, we report how thematic resolution affects the patchiness of mosaics representing natural landscapes, which have seldom been studied in this respect. We selected seven 50 \xc3\x97 50\xc2\xa0km landscapes within national parks, each representative of a world biome. We applied an object-based unsupervised classification to Landsat TM imagery of these landscapes using increasing numbers of classes, between 2 and 50, and derived curves of mean patch size and patch density for each site. Our results are consistent with previous findings in that the patchiness of output mosaics increases monotonically with increasing thematic resolution, with a higher rate of increase up to eight classes that declines until it becomes roughly constant for more than 16 classes. However, this constant rate of increase is still considerable, meaning that, at least for natural landscapes, there is no threshold beyond which the patch-mosaic model is independent of the conceptual filter applied. This dependence on human fiat calls for re-thinking the patch-mosaic paradigm.'

Abstract: ' Natural formation of treefall gaps plays an integral role in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of many tropical forests, affecting the spatiotemporal distribution of plants and the animals that interact with them. This study examines the impact of treefall gaps on the spatial and temporal patchiness of ant assemblages in a moist lowland forest in Panama. Using pitfall traps and honey baits, we compared ant assemblages in five 1 to 2-year-old treefall gaps (ca 100 m2) and five adjacent plots (ca 100 m2) in undisturbed forest understory at three different times of year (late wet season, late dry season, and early wet season). We found little evidence that ant assemblages respond dramatically to the formation of treefall gaps and the differences in habitat qualities they produce. Ant abundance, species richness, species composition, and rates of resource discovery did not differ between gaps and forest understory. However, we did find significant differences in numerical abundance related to forest stratum (ground vs vegetation) and resource type in pitfall traps (oil-cockroach vs honey), and significant differences in ant species richness and rates of resource discovery across seasons. While habitat effects by themselves were never statistically significant, habitat and seasonal differences in species richness interacted significantly to produce complex, season-dependent differences among gap and forest habitats. These results suggest that the formation of natural treefall gaps has less of an effect on Neotropical ant assemblages compared to other groups of organisms (e.g., plants, birds) or other causes of patchiness (e.g., ant mosaics, moisture availability, army ant predation). The results of our study also have important implications for the underlying causes of habitat differences in the distribution of ant-defended plants.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82In Macaranga myrmecophytes, differences in the production of the food bodies (FBs), on which symbiont ants feed, may relate to the intensity of antiherbivore defense by the ants. Interspecific comparisons among Macaranga species on such a mutualistic cost give important information on their strategies and evolution of antiherbivore defense. In this study, the carbon and nitrogen contents of FBs as well as the production rate of FBs were measured in three Macaranga species, M. winkleri, M. trachyphylla, and M. beccariana. There were significant differences in the production rates of FBs among species; the investment in FBs was greater in the Macaranga species in which ant defenses were more intensive. The carbon and nitrogen contents of FBs were significantly different among the three species, although they did not match the intensity of ant defense; the nitrogen content, especially, was greatest in the species of least intensive ant defense. It is suggested that Macaranga plants may have differentiated in the dependence on ant defense by controlling the total amount of nitrogen of FBs, not simply by nitrogen content.'

Abstract: 'Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a central role in atmospheric chemistry. In this work, VOCs in the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro were determined using the TO-15 Method. The park occupies 1,370,000\xc2\xa0m2 in the southern area of the city and is next to the Tijuca Forest, which is considered the largest secondary urban forest in the world. The total VOC concentrations ranged from 43.52 to 168.75\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x923, depending on the sampling site and dates. In terms of concentration isoprene represented 4\xc2\xa0%\xe2\x80\x9314\xc2\xa0% of the total VOC masses. The results suggested that the differences in biomass, distance from the street and activities within the park affected the concentrations of VOCs. The ratios of isoprene/aromatic compounds were higher than those determined in other areas of the city, confirming that the atmosphere of this green area has the contribution of other sources. Kinetic and mechanistic reactivities were also evaluated.'

Abstract: 'Many plants are defended indirectly by mutualistic animals. In this field study, we investigated the efficacy of indirect antiherbivore defence in symbiotic and non-symbiotic ant-plant associations in three Macaranga species. We tested whether obligate interactions are more effective than facultative ones by comparing ant-free plants, or parts of plants, with untreated controls. All three species gained significant protection from the ants\' presence. The efficacy of defence was higher in the obligate associations represented by M. triloba and M. hosei than in the facultative interaction (M. tanarius). After 40\xc2\xa0days of ant exclusion, missing leaf area amounted to 1.7% in M. hosei (compared to 0.2% in untreated, ant-defended controls), 2.6% in M. triloba (controls 1.2%) and 4.2% in M. tanarius (controls 3.2%). In a long-term study of M. triloba and M. hosei, ant protection was orders of magnitude higher than in the short-term results. Short-term experiments obviously are unsuited to obtaining a realistic picture of the long-term efficacy of antiherbivore defence. Within 1\xc2\xa0year, ant-free plants lost, on average, between 70% (M. hosei) and 80% (M. triloba) of their total leaf area. Both species appear to require their mutualistic ants for survival. Defence via symbiotic ants is obviously a very effective form of antiherbivore protection. Ants are highly mobile and defend preferentially young, vulnerable leaves and shoot tips, and they fulfil several functions which normally have to be provided by different chemical substances. This may be a general benefit of indirect plant defence, which makes use of "animal-specific" traits rather than intrinsic plant properties.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity hotspots are among some of the habitats most threatened by climate change, and the Brazilian Atlantic forest is no exception. Only 11.6\xc2\xa0% of the natural vegetation cover remains in an intensely fragmented state, which results in high vulnerability of this biome to climate change. Since >60\xc2\xa0% of the Brazilian people live within the Atlantic forest domain, societies both in rural and urban areas are also highly vulnerable to climate change. This review examines the vulnerabilities of biodiversity and society in the Atlantic forest to climate change, as well as impacts of land use and climate change, particularly on recent biological evidence of strong synergies and feedback between them. We then discuss the crucial role ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change might play in increasing the resilience of local society to future climate scenarios and provide some ongoing examples of good adaptive practices, especially related to ecosystem restoration and conservation incentive schemes such as payment for ecosystem services. Finally, we list a set of arguments about why we trust that the Atlantic forest can turn from a \xe2\x80\x9cshrinking biodiversity hotspot\xe2\x80\x9d to a climate adaptation \xe2\x80\x9chope spot\xe2\x80\x9d whereby society\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to climate change is reduced by protecting and restoring nature and improving human life standards.'

Abstract: 'The importance of light as a limiting factor for growth and reproductionin tropical understorey plants is well known, but the population-levelconsequences of light limitation remain little explored. Here, I usedemographicmodelling to examine if the effect of canopy gaps on individual-levelperformance in a tropical understorey palm translates into an effect on thepopulation growth rate. The demographic effects of heterogeneity in crownillumination (index of hemispherical canopy openness), forest-phase, and othermicroenvironmental parameters were quantified using data on 2592 individuals ofall sizes in permanent plots followed over a 1.5 year period. Supplementaryexperiments investigating the effects of canopy conditions on seedlingrecruitment were also conducted. Among the microenvironmental parameters onlycrown illumination and forest-phase had strong and consistent demographiceffects. Growth and fecundity generally increased with increasing crownillumination. Under open forest-phase conditions growth tended to increase andsurvival to decrease (due to increased physical damage). Seedlings transplantedinto gap centres were damaged by solarization. The population-level effect ofheterogeneity in crown illumination and forest-phase was investigated usingtransition matrix models. The overall population growth rate was 0.999, and notsignificantly different from 1. Illumination-specific models showed thatG. macrostachys would be unable to persist at permanentlylow illumination, but would increase in density under higher illumination.Forest-phase-specific models gave similar, but weaker results. Thus, inG. macrostachys effects of canopy openness onindividual-level performance strongly limit the population growth rate. Thepresent study thereby shows that fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in canopyopenness in the tropical rain forest understorey can play a central role in thepopulation ecology of shade-tolerant understorey plants.'

Abstract: 'Although previous studies have shown that ecosystem functions are affected by either trophic structure or habitat structure, there has been little consideration of their combined effects. Such interactions may be particularly important in systems where habitat and trophic structure covary. I use the aquatic insects in bromeliads to examine the combined effects of trophic structure and habitat structure on a key ecosystem function: detrital processing. In Costa Rican bromeliads, trophic structure naturally covaries with both habitat complexity and habitat size, precluding any observational analysis of interactions between factors. I therefore designed mesocosms that allowed each factor to be manipulated separately. Increases in mesocosm complexity reduced predator (damselfly larva) efficiency, resulting in high detritivore abundances, indirectly increasing detrital processing rates. However, increased complexity also directly reduced the per capita foraging efficiency of the detritivores. Over short time periods, these trends effectively cancelled each other out in terms of detrital processing. Over longer time periods, more complex patterns emerged. Increases in mesocosm size also reduced both predator efficiency and detritivore efficiency, leading to no net effect on detrital processing. In many systems, ecosystem functions may be impacted by strong interactions between trophic structure and habitat structure, cautioning against examining either effect in isolation.'

Abstract: 'This study aims to characterize the different types of certification in the Brazilian citriculture as well as analyze the major changes in the market. The paper also has the objective to discuss how social and environmental factors influence the demand for food certifications and the sustainability and ethics aspects in the field. Therefore, a literature review on the subject was carried out as well as a qualitative research using interviews with certifiers, governmental institutions, farmers, cooperatives and producer associations. The certification is becoming mandatory for those working in foreign markets and for those working nationally; it can be a competitive differential. The organic certification in citriculture shows the highest number of growers. Companies with large areas of citrus and the orange juice processing industry are adhering to this certification in order to maintain themselves competitive in the market. There is an enormous potential of Brazilian citriculture certification, because the certified area is still less than 6\xc2\xa0% of the total area. Certification reduces the asymmetry of information and consists of an important step towards sustainability although incapable of solely guaranteeing it.'

Abstract: 'Nonexcavators (secondary hole-nesters) are birds that critically depend on holes for nesting and roosting; the absence of holes renders habitat uninhabitable to them. In man-managed woods, their populations are known to increase with the provision of nest-boxes, suggesting that the birds are limited by shortage of holes and must compete for them. I use 30\xc2\xa0years of observations in the last fragments of primeval temperate forest of lowland Europe (Bia\xc5\x82owie\xc5\xbca National Park, eastern Poland) to test these assumptions. They show that, in primeval forest conditions, (1) birds do not face a shortage of holes, (2) competition for nest sites is of minor importance, (3) woodpeckers are not keystone hole providers, and (4) nonexcavated holes provide safer nest sites than excavated holes. The Bia\xc5\x82owie\xc5\xbca results are compared with studies from primeval forests on other continents. I conclude that in primeval forest conditions, hole-nesting nonexcavator birds are not, as a rule, nest-site-limited.'

Abstract: 'A population viability analysis (PVA) using the computer package VORTEX was conducted to assess the minimum viable population (MVP) of the Atlantic Forest endemic marsupial Micoureus paraguayanus. The objectives were: to estimate demographic and genetic MVPs that could be used as quasi-extinction thresholds for future modeling, to estimate the minimum area of suitable habitat (MASH), and to use these results to apply IUCN red list criteria so as to suggest its proper status classification. The model predicted that populations of 100 and 2000 individuals were necessary to achieve demographic and genetic stability, respectively, within a time frame of 100\xc2\xa0years. The model was sensitive to changes in inbreeding depression, mortality and reproduction. MASH estimated to contain genetically viable populations reached 1300\xc2\xa0ha. Fortunately, there still are quite a number of forest remnants equal to or larger than this. Isolation is suggested as the principal threat facing M. paraguayanus. Therefore, promoting conditions for dispersal together with efforts dealing with translocation, should prove to be the most appropriate management strategies for M. paraguayanus at this stage. A landscape pattern composed of large patches holding MVPs and sets of smaller patches harboring viable metapopulations that maximize probability of dispersal can provide a viable scenario for the conservation of M. paraguayanus.'

Abstract: 'In French Guiana, a French overseas territory in South America, 6 to 10 thousands undocumented persons work illegally in gold mining sites in the Amazonian forest. Precarious life conditions lead to poor health but few data exist on the health status of illegal gold miners in French Guiana. The objective of this article was to describe the sociodemographic and health status of this vulnerable population.'

Abstract: 'In the coastal littoral forest of extreme southeastern Madagascar, westudied tree diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm in 20, 50\xc3\x97 50 m plots in each of four forest fragments, andunderstorywoody vegetation (DBH < 10 cm, \xe2\x89\xa51 m tall) in60,10 \xc3\x97 10 m plots in three of the fragments. Oneforestfragment was located in the highly degraded Lokaro region, and three in the nearbySainte-Luce forest. Atotal of 3476 trees, representing 169 species in 55 families, were recorded inthe50 \xc3\x97 50 m plots, and 10282 understory stems, representing195 species in 54 families, were found in the 10 \xc3\x97 10m plots. For each tree, DBH was recorded. Mean tree diameter andpatterns of tree size class distribution did not differ among the four forestfragments. However, the fragments differed significantly in both tree andunderstory stem densities, species richness and diversity values, and familyrichness values, with the Lokaro fragment having the lowest values for allmeasures. Furthermore, floristic patterns, family importance values, and communitysimilarity measures revealed that the species composition at theLokaro fragment was very different from the Sainte-Luce fragments. Anthropogenicdisturbance appears most pronounced in the isolated Lokaro forest, where bioticresources are limited to this single fragment.'

Abstract: 'The population structure of the canopy liana Machaerium cuspidatum Kuhlm. & Hoehne (Fabaceae) was studied in ten transects covering a total of 2.5 ha of tropical rain forest in Yasun\xc3\xad National Park, eastern Ecuador. The aim was to investigate how trellis availability, topographic position and light availability affected the population density and structure of the most abundant liana species in the area. The environmental variation affected plants in different size classes differently. Large plants (diameter \xe2\x89\xa5 1 cm) were almost exclusively found in areas with low canopy and dense undergrowth. These areas had the highest density of suitable host plants. Seedling-sized plants (height < 30 cm) and saplings (height \xe2\x89\xa5 30 cm but diameter < 1 cm) occurred more frequently and withhigher density in steep upland areas than in the floodplains, presumably due to elevated seedling mortality in the periodically flooded areas. Seedling-sized plants and saplings did not grow in areas with elevated light levels, and although plants of all sizes were highly clumped, this clumping rarely coincided with patches with abundant canopy gaps. Machaerium cuspidatum reproduces clonally when branches re-root and break off from the parentplant. The density of clonally produced plants was high in areas where the density of sexually produced plants was low, whereas the total density varied little among habitat types. A higher proportion of the seedling-sized plants were of sexual origin in the upland areas. An environmentally induced increase in the production of independent ramets enables M. cuspidatum to persist in the floodplains. This shows that plants may expand theirrealised niches to habitats with a low potential for seedling survival if high seedling mortality can be compensated for by increased clonal reproduction.'

Abstract: 'This study evaluated for the first time the life cycle of Amblyomma ovale in the laboratory. For this purpose, larvae and nymphs were exposed to Gallus gallus (chickens), Cavia porcellus (guinea pigs), Rattus norvegicus (wistar rats), Oryctolagus cuniculus (domestic rabbits), Calomys callosus (vesper mouse), and Didelphis albiventris (white-eared opossum). Nymphs were also exposed to Nectomys squamipes (South American water rat). Adult ticks were fed on dogs. The life-cycle of A. ovale in laboratory could be completed in an average period of ca. 190\xc2\xa0days, considering prefeeding periods of 30\xc2\xa0days for each of the parasitic stages. Vesper mice were the most suitable host for A. ovale larvae, whereas water rats were the most suitable host for A. ovale nymphs. Our results, coupled with literature data, strongly indicate that small rodents have an important role in the life history of A. ovale. Chickens (the only avian host used in the present study) showed to be moderately suitable hosts for subadult A. ovale ticks, indicating that wild birds might have a secondary role in the life history of A. ovale. Domestic dogs showed to be highly suitable for the adult stage of A. ovale, in agreement with literature data that indicate that the domestic dog is currently one of the most important hosts of A. ovale adult ticks in Latin America.'

Abstract: 'In several tropical regions of the world, formerly widespread forests have been reduced to scattered remnants, and many tree species are becoming increasingly endangered. Knowledge on the population status of rare species is essential to inform conservation efforts and, in particular, the use of native species for reforestation projects stemming from emerging land-use strategies. We studied 20 mostly red-listed native species in remnant forests on five limestone-, four volcanic- and one ultramafic site(s) across the Visayas in the Philippines, with 40 plots being assessed at each site. Seventeen of the species showed a median density of less than two trees per hectare, with ten species showing median densities of zero due to low species frequency, although some had higher local densities. One species (Dracontomelon edule) was not encountered at all, while two other species (Dipterocarpus validus and Dracontomelon dao) were only encountered as singletons. Six species were confined to limestone sites and showed associations with other better-known limestone specialists. The other study species occurred at both site types. Four of the species showed significant relationships between stem density, soil pH and stand basal area. The particular rarity of the majority of the species calls for immediate conservation measures to be adopted to protect species and associated remnant forests. In addition to legal measures such as the designation of remnant forests as protected areas, we recommend the establishment of mixed native forest stands giving due regard to the species associations and site characteristics identified in this study.'

Abstract: "Eugenia uniflora L. (pitanga) is widely distributed in tropical areas. It is present in coastal vegetation from Ceara, in northeastern Brazil, to Rio Grande do Sul, at the southern tip of the country. Eugenia uniflora is of ecological importance, both as colonizing species on disturbed land and as food supplier for a wide variety of insects, birds and mammals. Pitanga plays a role in the maintenance of shrubby coastal ecosystems, especially at disturbed sites, and in 'restinga' ecosystems, at the interface between low forest and strand vegetation. To investigate the genetic diversity residing within the species, three neighboring populations at a distance of less than 24 km from each other, with varying degrees of human impact, were studied. The level of genetic diversity within and between populations was assessed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methodology. A total of 532 AFLP markers were analyzed in 66 individual trees. The polymorphism level varied from 61.2 to 96% depending on the primer combination used. Intra- and inter-population genetic diversity analysis showed that more than 88% of the variation resided within the populations, with a Gst of 0.123. Nevertheless, using neighbor joining (NJ) and principal component analysis (PCA), on the genetic distance (GD) data, permitted the three analyzed populations to be differentiated."

Abstract: 'Waters entering the small estuaries of the Brazilian north-east originate from drainage basins that cross semi-arid and tropical rainforest areas at various levels of use and conservation. Such rivers are often under heavy demand for water supply and other services, such as effluent dilution. The present study examines four consecutive years (2006\xe2\x80\x932009) of water quality-monitoring data divided by season (rainy and dry) just before the Goiana River enters its estuary. The environmental variables are largely controlled by rainfall patterns. The water temperatures are consistently above 25\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, which impairs dissolved oxygen levels (3.1 to 6.7\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) and may suggest eutrophication. By contrast, biochemical oxygen demand, percentage O2 saturation and total phosphorous (which are eutrophication indicators) do not show non-compliant levels, according to local legislation. Although the monitoring stations surround a municipal centre, the estuary is downstream from this area, the main uses of which are artisanal fisheries, nature conservation, leisure and aquaculture. Therefore, continuous monitoring and long-term analysis of the resulting water quality are important.'

Abstract: 'Cocoa is a crop grown largely by smallholder farmers in the lowland tropics, including parts of Latin America, West Africa, and Indonesia. Research suggests that it has the potential to provide biodiversity benefits when grown under certain shade conditions, especially when compared with alternative land uses. The primary literature on cocoa production reveals a range of objectives for improvement of cocoa production on small farms. These objectives are sometimes in direct opposition to each other, for example, increasing productivity through shade removal and chemical inputs, and the desire to increase biodiversity benefits. These opposing goals demonstrate some real trade-offs faced by cocoa producers. We summarize the current literature, drawing attention to some of these trade-offs and highlighting important ecological, economic, and social considerations. In considering strategies for ameliorating these negative tradeoffs, we make two primary policy recommendations. First, we suggest that outreach focusing on farm diversification may be the most effective way of optimizing ecological, economic, and social outcomes. Farm diversification may provide an effective means of achieving improved farmer security and dissuade farmers from abandoning or planting cocoa according to price fluctuations, thus reducing the use of new forest areas in cocoa production. Secondly, we suggest greater focus on determining effective economic incentives for maintaining shade in cocoa production. For example, price premiums associated high quality shade-grown cocoa may increase economic benefits while simultaneously providing incentives to farmers to maintain shade in production. Lastly, we identify some important areas of research for further informing policy in this arena.'

Abstract: 'As information on the economic, environmental and social benefits of cocoa has grown, so has the understanding that only a coordinated effort by all stakeholders can ensure cocoa sustainability. This chapter describes how challenges to cocoa supplies brought seemingly disparate \xe2\x80\x93 if not competitive \xe2\x80\x93 groups together in unique public/private partnerships. While it is not meant to be an exhaustive listing of every initiative that has been developed, it provides an overview of how working across sectors has benefited all of those involved in the cocoa industry \xe2\x80\x93 corporations, governments, nongovernment organizations and individual farmers. The progress they have made and the lessons learned from these partnerships will help frame policies and practices aimed at ensuring a healthy future for all involved in the cocoa industry, and be a model for such initiatives for the development of other shaded perennial crops in agroforestry systems.'

Abstract: 'The ability to relocate home or breeding sites after experimental removal has been observed in several amphibians and the sensory basis of this behavior has been studied in some temperate-region species. However, the actual return trajectories have rarely been quantified in these studies and it remains unknown how different cues guide the homing behavior. Dendrobatidae (dart-poison frogs) exhibit some of the most complex spatial behaviors among amphibians, such as territoriality and tadpole transport. Recent data showed that Allobates femoralis, a frog with paternal tadpole transport, successfully returns to the home territories after experimental translocations of up to 400\xc2\xa0m. In the present study, we used harmonic direction finding to obtain homing trajectories. Additionally, we quantified the initial orientation of individuals, translocated 10\xc2\xa0m to 105\xc2\xa0m, in an arena assay.'

Abstract: 'Climate changes affect the abundance, geographic extent, and floral composition of vegetation, which are reflected in the pollen rain. Sediment cores taken from lakes and peat bogs can be analysed for their pollen content. The fossil pollen records provide information on the temporal changes in climate and palaeo-environments. Although the complexity of the variables influencing vegetation distribution requires a multi-dimensional approach, only a few research projects have used GIS to analyse pollen data. This paper presents a new approach to palynological data analysis by combining GIS and spatial modelling. Eastern Colombia was chosen as a study area owing to the migration of the forest\xe2\x80\x93savanna boundary since the last glacial maximum, and the availability of pollen records. Logistic regression has been used to identify the climatic variables that determine the distribution of savanna and forest in eastern Colombia. These variables were used to create a predictive land-cover model, which was subsequently implemented into a GIS to perform spatial analysis on the results. The palynological data from the study area were incorporated into the GIS. Reconstructed maps of past vegetation distribution by interpolation showed a new approach of regional multi-site data synthesis related to climatic parameters. The logistic regression model resulted in a map with 85.7% predictive accuracy, which is considered useful for the reconstruction of future and past land-cover distributions. The suitability of palynological GIS application depends on the number of pollen sites, the distribution of the pollen sites over the area of interest, and the degree of overlap of the age ranges of the pollen records.'

Abstract: 'HY-2A is the first one of the Chinese HY-2 ocean satellite series carrying a microwave radiometer (RM) to measure sea surface temperature, sea surface wind speed, atmospheric water vapor, cloud liquid water content, and rain rate. We verified the RM level 1B brightness temperature (TB) to retrieve environmental parameters. In the verification, TB that simulated using the ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer model (RTM) was used as a reference. The total bias and total standard deviation (SD) of the RM level 1B TB, with reference to the RTM simulation, ranged -20.6\xe2\x80\x934.38 K and 0.7\xe2\x80\x932.93 K, respectively. We found that both the total bias and the total SD depend on the frequency and polarization, although the values for ascending and descending passes are different. In addition, substantial seasonal variation of the bias was found at all channels. The verification results indicate the RM has some problems regarding calibration, e.g., correction of antenna spillover and antenna physical emission, especially for the 18.7-GHz channel. Based on error analyses, a statistical recalibration algorithm was designed and recalibration was performed for the RM level 1B TB. Validation of the recalibrated TB indicated that the quality of the recalibrated RM level 1B TB was improved significantly. The bias of the recalibrated TB at all channels was reduced to < 0.4 K, seasonal variation was almost eradicated, and SD was diminished (i.e., the SD of the 18.7-GHz channel was reduced by more than 0.5 K).'

Abstract: 'A preliminary assessment of the utilization of plant species was undertaken within an Amerindian community at Kurupukari, Guyana. A total of 120 plant species of 46 plant families, covering 246 different plant uses were identified. Plant uses were divided into six utilization categories; 64 species for medicinal, 53 for technological, 43 edible, 20 for timber, 14 for construction and two species with miscellaneous uses. Of the 120 plant species, one species was recorded with five different use categories, two with four and 13 with three. A further 23 species were identified as having multiple uses. Of the 20 commercial timber species, five species were also shown to exhibit some form of non-timber product use, emphasising the under-utilization of species extraction. The dual extraction of both timber and non-timber resources from the same tree as a more effective sustainable utilization of available forest resources is also discussed.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry trees are now well known to play a central role in the build up of nutrients pools and their transformations similar to that of forest ecosystem, however, information on the potential of homegarden trees accumulating and releasing nitrogen (mineralization) is lacking. The present study reports seasonal variations in pool sizes of mineral N (NH 4 + -N and NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 -N), and net N-mineralization rate in relation to rainfall and temperature under coconut (Cocos nucifera L.), clove (Eugenia caryophyllata Thunb) and nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt. Nees) trees in a coconut-spice trees plantation for two annual cycles in the equatorial humid climate of South Andaman Island of India. Concentration of NH 4 + -N was the highest during wet season (May\xe2\x80\x93October) and the lowest during post-wet season (November\xe2\x80\x93January) under all the tree species. On the contrary, concentration of NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 -N was the lowest in the wet season and the highest during the post-wet season. However, concentrations of the mineral N were the highest under the nutmeg and the lowest under the coconut trees. Like the pool sizes, mean annual mineralization was the highest under the nutmeg (561\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921) and the lowest under the coconut trees (393\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921). Rate of mineralization was the highest during the post-wet season and the lowest during the dry season (February\xe2\x80\x93April) under all the tree species. High rainfall during the wet season, however, reduced the rate of nitrification under all the tree species. The mean annual mineralization was logarithmically related with rainfall amount and mean monthly temperature.'

Abstract: "Kubo producer-units (families and independent bachelors) could have been self-sufficient in the production of bananas but chose not to be. Nor did they seek self-sufficiency in the production of any combination of staple carbohydrate foods (bananas, tubers, sago flour) or, in the long term, strive for balance in the exchange of food with other producer-units. Despite the fact that bananas, which provided 50% of people's energy needs, were a delayed-return crop Kubo communities were very unstable. This instability and the failure to choose the option of self-sufficiency were connected and were mediated through intense intracommunity sharing that, ultimately, served to negotiate a concern with sorcery. The people grew bananas in the way they did, not out of environmental necessity, but to accommodate the crop to the needs of sharing and, thereby, facilitate community living."

Abstract: 'Many in development are disenchanted with the concept of \xe2\x80\x98sustainable development\xe2\x80\x99, which perpetuates the idea of infinite growth and overreliance on markets for improved well-being. Alejandro Argumedo and Michel Pimbert explore the non-monetized barter markets developed by the Quechua peoples of the Peruvian Andes. They reflect the local philosophy of social reciprocity and ecological equilibrium and can inspire others seeking to support local food sovereignty, ecological diversity and economies based on solidarity rather than greed.'

Abstract: 'Prior land-use history might influence damage and recovery of plant communities from natural disturbance. We examined effects of previous agricultural land use on damage and recovery of plant communities affected by Hurricane Georges. The study was conducted in the karst region of Los Haitises National Park, Dominican Republic. We compared pre- and post-hurricane stem density, basal area and diversity of woody vegetation in sites within the park that had been subject to different land use histories. The type of land uses included a wide range of histories, ranging from abandoned pastures and conucos (mixed plantings) to cacao plantations, intact forests and mogotes (hilltop communities) with no recent history of land use. Previous land use and the amount of basal area present prior to the hurricane determined effects of, and recovery from hurricane disturbance. Systems with high pre-hurricane basal area lost many large trees, whereas the basal area hardly changed in systems without large trees. Thus, basal area decreased at forested sites, mogotes, and cacao plantations and remained comparable to pre-hurricane figures in all other land uses. Shifts in species diversity paralleled to some degree reductions in basal area. Species diversity increased in mogotes and cacao plantations, perhaps as a result of hurricane damage to the forest canopy, which facilitated regeneration of heliophilic species. Finally, regeneration of cacao seedlings in former cacao plantations, and growth of pioneer species in young conucos (mixed plantings) more than doubled post-hurricane stem densities for these two types of land use. Previous agricultural land use left a lasting impression on the structure and composition on plant communities, which persisted even after hurricane damage.'

Abstract: 'This study investigates commonalities and differences in projected land biosphere carbon storage among climate change projections derived from one emission scenario by five different general circulation models (GCMs). Carbon storage is studied using a global biogeochemical process model of vegetation and soil that includes dynamic treatment of changes in vegetation composition, a recently enhanced version of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM). Uncertainty in future terrestrial carbon storage due to differences in the climate projections is large. Changes by the end of the century range from \xe2\x88\x92106 to +201 PgC, thus, even the sign of the response whether source or sink, is uncertain. Three out of five climate projections produce a land carbon source by the year 2100, one is approximately neutral and one a sink. A regional breakdown shows some robust qualitative features. Large areas of the boreal forest are shown as a future CO2 source, while a sink appears in the arctic. The sign of the response in tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems differs among models, due to the large variations in simulated precipitation patterns. The largest uncertainty is in the response of tropical rainforests of South America and Central Africa.'

Abstract: 'The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis was long thought to be restricted to temperate forests. However, as tropical forests have been explored, it has become clear that these habitats host unique ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. We have been exploring tropical dry forests (TDF), which are endangered terrestrial ecosystems and hotspots of endemism. Since Fabaceae is the main plant family in this environment, we hypothesized that trees in this lineage would be the main ECM hosts. We sequenced the ITS rDNA region from fungi and both rbcL and trnL cpDNA from plants to identify both symbiotic partners from root tips. The systematic position of each symbiont was confirmed by Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We identified 20 plant species belonging to 10 families that hosted 19 unique ECM fungal species from 5 lineages. Most ECM fungi were associated with Caryophyllales, not with Fabaceae. Achatocarpus and Guapira, the main hosts, are scattered throughout the forest and are not in monodominant patches. The low ECM fungal diversity can be explained by the low density of host plants and their high specificity. Our results indicate that Caryophyllales is an important order of tropical ECM hosts with at least four independent evolutionary lineages that have evolved the ability to form ectomycorrhizae.'

Abstract: 'For forest ecosystem management to be effective, knowledge of the horizontal and vertical structural diversity of a forest is essential. The moist Afromontane highlands of Wondo Genet in south-central Ethiopia present an opportunity to restore and rehabilitate and enhance the ecosystem services to be obtained from this forest sustainably. We focused on the forest structural characteristics to better understand the current forest conditions to assist in the sustainable management of this resource. A total of 75 (20 m \xc3\x97 20 m) quadrats were sampled and diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa5 2 cm and stem height \xe2\x89\xa5 2 m were measured. Species identity and abundance, elevation, slope, and aspect were recorded for each plot. Structural characteristics were computed for each plot. Relationship of topographic factors with vegetation characteristics was conducted using R-Software. A total of 72 woody species was recorded. Whereas, the overall diameter distribution shows an inverted J-shaped curve, the basal area followed a bell-shaped pattern. Five types of population structures are revealed. The mean tree density and basal area was 397.3 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 31.4 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. Only 2.8% of the tree species have densities of >25 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and the percentage distribution of trees show 56.2% in the DBH class 2\xe2\x80\x9310 cm, indicating that the forest is dominated by medium-sized trees. Celtis africana (8.81 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921) and Pouteria adolfi-friedericii (5.13 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921) make the highest contribution to the basal area and species importance value index. The families/species with the highest importance value index are Ulmaceae, Fabacea and Sapotaceae. Species abundance (r 2 =0.32, p <0.001) and species richness (r 2 =0.50, p <0.001) are positively related with tree density. Tree density is negatively related with elevation (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.36, p <0.001), slope (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.15, p <0.001) and aspect (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.07, p <0.05). While basal area is negatively related with elevation (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.14, p <0.001), it has a positive relationship with tree density (r 2 =0.28, p <0.001 and species richness (r 2 =0.098). Species with poor population structure should be assisted by restoration tasks and further anthropogenic disturbance such as illegal logging and fuel wood extraction should be restricted.'

Abstract: 'Ectothermic body temperatures affect organismal performances and presumably fitness, and are strongly influenced by the thermal environment. Therefore, the processes of colonization of novel thermal habitats by lizards might involve changes in thermal preferences, performance curves (reaction norms) and field activity temperatures. According to theory based on optimality analysis, diverse aspects of the thermal biology of vertebrate ectotherms should co-evolve as to maximize performance at the temperature range more often experienced by animals in the field. One corollary of this premise is that derived lizard clades that experienced a significant shift in thermal ecology, in comparison with the ancestral condition, should prefer and select temperatures in a thermal gradient similar to those experienced in nature. Here we report an analysis of the premise stated before. Specifically, we verify whether or not Tropidurinae species from three major Brazilian habitats (the Rainforests, the semi-arid Caatingas and the Cerrados, a Savannah-like biome) differ in thermal ecology and thermoregulatory behavior. The Caatinga is believed to be the ancestral habitat of this sub-family, and differences are expected because species from semi-arid habitats usually exhibit high body temperatures for lizards, whereas forest specialists might be thermoconformers and active at low temperatures. We also compared selected temperatures in the laboratory by species from the two open habitats (Caatingas and Cerrados). Data were analyzed using both conventional and phylogenetic analysis tools. Although species from Caatingas exhibited higher activity temperatures in nature than those from Cerrados, mean selected temperatures were similar between ecological groups. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed these findings and evidenced large\xe2\x90\xa3evolutionary divergence in field activity temperatures between sister species from different\xe2\x90\xa3open habitats without coupled divergence in selected temperatures. Therefore, thermoregulatory behavior and ecological parameters did not evolve similarly during the colonization of contrasting open habitats by Tropidurinae.'

Abstract: 'In this study we explore the phylogenetic relationships within the hummingbird genera Doryfera, Schistes and Colibri (Family Trochilidae), distributed in the Andes, the Pantepui, the southern Brazilian uplands and the lowlands of South America including the Choc\xc3\xb3, the Amazon Basin, the Chaco, the Cerrado, and the southeastern Brazilian coast, as well as Central and Mesoamerica. To do this, we included a comprehensive sampling of the 16 traditionally recognized subspecies within this group. We found that Doryfera, Schistes and Colibri form a well-supported monophyletic group, and that most of the traditionally recognized subspecies are indeed evolutionary lineages. As there is a high likelihood that the ancestors of this clade of hummingbirds were distributed in the lowlands, we ask: what events might account for the diversification of this subclade of mangoes into the Andes with a later potential dispersal episode from the Andes to the lowlands? We found that several phenomena such as the uplift of the Andes, the marine transgressions of the Plio\xe2\x80\x93Pleistocene, the final closure of the Isthmus of Panama and the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene might be at least, in part, responsible for the diversification of this group in both the lowlands and the highlands of this region of South America.'

Abstract: 'Data from an ethnobotanical study were analyzed to see if they were in agreement with the biochemical basis of the apparency hypothesis based on an analysis of a pharmacopeia in a rural community adjacent to the Araripe National Forest (Floresta Nacional do Araripe - FLONA) in northeastern Brazil. The apparency hypothesis considers two groups of plants, apparent and non-apparent, that are characterized by conspicuity for herbivores (humans) and their chemical defenses.'

Abstract: 'Conservation of biodiversity will necessitate choices among areas, taxa, and land-use patterns. Lack of data on distribution and pattern in biodiversity makes these difficult decisions even more problematic for those charged with the conservation and sustainable use of the diversity of life. Quantitative methods have promise in helping with this task in that they allow people to make their values explicit, and they also allow representation and comparison of many different types of data.'

Abstract: 'In vitro strategies for Passiflora have been developed owing to its economic and ecological importance. However, plantlet regeneration through somatic embryogenesis has presented some problems, such as the reproducibility of the protocol and formation of abnormal embryos and plantlets. Thus, this study aimed to establish a protocol exploring the embryogenic potential of immature zygotic embryos (IZE) of the wild species Passiflora miniata Vanderpl. and Passiflora speciosa Gardn. Friable calli, which formed on the abaxial surface of the cotyledons, yielded globular, heart-shaped, torpedo and cotyledonary somatic embryos, characterising the embryogenic response as asynchronous. A high percentage of normal regenerants (90\xc2\xa0%) was obtained from IZE in media lacking 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in comparison to the value of normal plantlets (60\xc2\xa0%) regenerated from mature zygotic embryos inoculated in media with 2,4-D. This result demonstrates that IZE of P. miniata and P. speciosa possess sufficient levels of endogenous phytohormones to trigger a high rate of indirect somatic embryogenesis. All regenerated plantlets had the same genome size and chromosome number as the explant donor plants. Therefore, the indirect embryogenic pathway, employing IZE inoculated into media free of growth regulators, did not cause changes in the karyotype and morphology. Based on these results, IZE should be considered as explant for the establishment of somatic embryogenesis in other species. Besides, a new, reliable and relatively rapid protocol to recover plantlets of P. miniata and P. speciosa yielded several plants, which were acclimatised and used for ornamental purposes and breeding programs, and for reintroduction into biological reserves.'

Abstract: 'Brazil is the fifth most populous country in the world with widespread regional and social inequalities. Regional disparities in healthcare are unacceptably large, with the remote and poor regions of the north and northeast having reduced life expectancy compared to the south region, where life expectancy approaches that of rich countries. We report our experience of a humanitarian surgery mission to the Amazonas state, in the northwest part of Brazil.'

Abstract: "For thousands of years, Indian tribes have gathered, selected, domesticated and spread useful plants over the whole American continent while mostly practicing shifting forms of horti-agriculture. It has been argued that origin and domestication of New World crops could be traced back to essentially two independent, narrowly circumscribed core regions, (i.e. Vavilov's genecentres) one in the highlands of Mexico and the other in the Andes of Peru. Those alleged centers of origin and genetic diversity have been synchronized with the main cradles of American agriculture. Based on long periods of research work in South America, we disagree with this opinion which is maintained primarily by anthropologists, sociologists and ethnologists. Except for marginal desert and mountain environments, there are no real biogeographical restrictions for plant domestication. Apparent geographical barriers, like the Darien gap, did not represent insurmountable hindrances for the diffusion and migration of useful species in the hands of indigenous peoples."

Abstract: 'Tropical fruit-feeding nymphalid butterflies generally restrict adult foraging exclusively to either the canopy or understory strata. We compared canopy and understory butterfly communities using data from four long-term studies in Central and South America. At all study sites we found little similarity in species composition between canopy and understory, with most species showing a strong affinity for one of the two habitats. There was a consistent phylogenetic signal for canopy and understory association, suggesting a substantial evolutionary history with these habitats. In addition to compositional differences, we found different patterns of beta diversity between canopy and understory communities. Across all study sites, the canopy had greater temporal and spatial beta diversity compared to the understory. Although these two communities are composed of the same feeding guild and separated only by a relatively small vertical space, each has its own stratum-specific species composition and community dynamics.'

Abstract: 'In the Neotropics, the Ericaceae are an Andean-centered family, adapted to moist, open, cool montane environments. Overall species richness increases nearer the Equator, with the highest species numbers concentrated in Colombia and Ecuador between 1000 m and 3000 m. There are 46 genera (70% endemic) and about 800 species (ca. 94% endemic) of Ericaceae native to the Neotropics. Five biogeographical regions are recognized for the neotropical Ericaceae, with the greatest species diversity found in the Andes of northwestern South America. Following Pliocene/Pleistocene mountain-building and climatic events, neotropical Ericaceae underwent dynamic speciation and extensive adaptive radiation due to their ecological and life-form plasticity, colonization abilities, adaptation to epiphytic habits, and coevolution with hummingbirds. Given high diversity and singularity within neotropical Ericaceae, along with high levels of habitat alteration, protection of Andean montane ecosystems should become a priority for the conservation of Ericaceae in the Neotropics.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests are responsible for a large proportion of the global terrestrial C flux annually for natural ecosystems. Increased atmospheric CO2 and changes in climate are likely to affect the distribution of C pools in the tropics and the rate of cycling through vegetation and soils. In this paper, I review the literature on the pools and fluxes of carbon in tropical forests, and the relationship of these to nutrient cycling and climate. Tropical moist and humid forests have the highest rates of annual net primary productivity and the greatest carbon flux from soil respiration globally. Tropical dry forests have lower rates of carbon circulation, but may have greater soil organic carbon storage, especially at depths below 1 meter. Data from tropical elevation gradients were used to examine the sensitivity of biogeochemical cycling to incremental changes in temperature and rainfall. These data show significant positive correlations of litterfall N concentrations with temperature and decomposition rates. Increased atmospheric CO2 and changes in climate are expected to alter carbon and nutrient allocation patterns and storage in tropical forest. Modeling and experimental studies suggest that even a small increase in temperature and CO2 concentrations results in more rapid decomposition rates, and a large initial CO2 efflux from moist tropical soils. Soil P limitation or reductions in C:N and C:P ratios of litterfall could eventually limit the size of this flux. Increased frequency of fires in dry forest and hurricanes in moist and humid forests are expected to reduce the ecosystem carbon storage capacity over longer time periods.'

Abstract: 'The Mapire river mouth forms a complex floodplain system, where the river behaves as a river during the dry season, but changes to a transient lake which partially covers the inundation forest during the rainy season. Thus, we expected changes in water chemistry and a gradual increase of primary production during high waters. The system was sampled monthly for one year; two floodplain lakes were also studied for comparative purposes.'

Abstract: 'The second largest biome in Brazil, the Cerrado has been transformed into a highly mechanized and intensive agricultural area, with little public opposition. The native anurofauna is rich in species number and endemisms, but has long been regarded as a generalist community originated from neighboring biomes. The accelerated degradation of Cerrado habitats caused by agriculture is bound to affect local anuran communities. This review aims to investigate the effects of anthropogenic activities on local amphibians. Despite a clear paucity, the existing studies indicate that, while this community may be more resilient to some anthropogenic activities (e.g. fire) than their forest counterparts, agricultural environments are strongly dominated by generalist species. Susceptibility to agro-cattle land-uses appears to be determined by specializations, especially regarding habitat and breeding strategies. Natural vegetation fragments are important for maintaining diverse anuran communities in agroecosystems. Agrochemicals cause histopathologic alterations and potential decreased fitness. Chytridiomycosis has been recorded in species extant in the biome, including endemics. The anurofauna appears to be especially sensitive to hydroelectric dams, as even previously common, widespread and generalist species declined or disappeared after dam flooding. Latest predictions indicate the occupation of the Cerrado will proceed northward, which, coupled with climate change, will cause great loss of biodiversity. Only a small portion of suitable natural habitats will remain in northern Cerrado, with amphibian richness being reduced to less than half. We conclude that less popular biomes may benefit from trait-oriented reviews to assess and guide future scientific and conservation projects.'

Abstract: 'Tree size, density, and species richness were established for three one-hectare plots of terra firme forest in central Amazonian Brazil. In the three hectares, 1916 individual trees with DBH 10 \xe2\x89\xa5 cm were sampled. A total of 58 families, 181 genera, and 513 species were determined. Hectare A had 285 species, 138 genera, and 47 families; hectare B 280 species, 123 genera, and 48 families; and hectare C 280 species, 125 genera, and 44 families. Comparably high species richness in Amazonia has heretofore only been reported from western Amazonia. This dispels the idea that high species richness can only develop in areas with rich soils and relatively high rainfall. It is suggested that such high species richness is the result of a combination of habitat heterogeneity and geological history. These high diversity forests, because they occur on nutrient poor soils, can be protected with little or no impact on development in the region because the soils are essentially useless for agriculture and for supporting long-term cattle pasture.'

Abstract: 'The spatio-temporal patterns of soil fertility and soil solution chemistry in a multi-strata agroforestry system with perennial crops were analysed as indicators for the effects of crop species and management measures on soil conditions under permanent agriculture in central Amazonia. The study was carried out in a plantation with locally important tree crop species and a leguminous cover crop at two fertilization levels on a xanthic Ferralsol. Soil fertility to 2 m soil depth was evaluated 3.5 years after the establishment of the plantation, and soil solution chemistry at 10, 60 and 200 cm soil depth was monitored over 2 years. Several soil fertility characteristics exhibited spatial patterns within the multi-strata plots which reflected the differing properties of the plant species and their management, including the fertilizer input. Significant differences between species could be detected to 150 cm depth, and between fertilization treatments to 200 cm depth. Favourable effects on nutrient availability in the soil were found for annatto (Bixa orellana) (P, K) and cupua\xc3\xa7u (Theobroma grandiflorum) (Ca, Mg) in comparison with peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) and Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa). Nutrient concentrations of the soil solution showed pronounced fluctuations in the topsoil, corresponding to fertilizer applications. Large nutrient concentrations in the soil solution were accompanied by increased concentrations of aluminium and low pH values, caused by exchange reactions between fertilizer and sorbed acidity and reinforced by the acidifying effect of nitrification. The soil solution under the leguminous cover crop Pueraria phaseoloides had relatively large N concentrations during periods when those under the tree crops were small, and this could partly explain why no yield responses to N fertilization were observed at this site.'

Abstract: "Estimates of carbon emissions from the forest sector in Mexico are derived for the year 1985 and for two contrasting scenarios in 2025. The analysis covers both tropical and temperate closed forests. In the mid-1980s, approximately 804,000 ha/year of closed forests suffered major perturbations, of which 668,000 ha was deforestation. Seventy-five percent of total deforestation is concentrated in tropical forests. The resulting annual carbon balance from land-use change is estimated at 67.0 \xc3\x97 106 tons/year, which lead to net emissions of 52.3 \xc3\x97 106 tons/year accounting for the carbon uptake in restoration plantations and degraded forest lands. This last figure represents approximately 40% of the country's estimated annual total carbon emissions for 1985\xe2\x80\x931987. The annual carbon balance from the forest sector in 2025 is expected to decline to 28.0 \xc3\x97 106 t in the reference scenario and to become negative (i.e., a carbon sink), 62.0 \xc3\x97 106 t in the policy scenario. A number of policy changes are identified that would help achieve the carbon sequestration potential identified in this last scenario."

Abstract: 'Carbon and nutrient losses were quantified from four small headwater catchments in western Kenya in the year 2008. They include a forested catchment and three catchments under maize continuously cultivated for 5, 10 and 50\xc2\xa0years following forest conversion. The C isotopic composition of dissolved organic C (DOC) in stream discharge suggested that soil organic C (SOC) derived from the original forest rather than OC from maize may have contributed to a large extent to watershed OC losses, even 50\xc2\xa0years after the forest was removed. Flow-weighted stream water concentrations of DOC and coarse particulate OC, all N species, total P, K and Na significantly (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) increased in streams after forest conversion and long-term cultivation. Solute concentrations increased despite the fact that soil contents decreased and total water flow increased indicating mobilization of C and N, P and K from soil with progressing cultivation. In contrast, Ca and Mg concentrations in stream water did not systematically change after deforestation and cultivation, and may be controlled by geochemical weathering rather than by changing water flow paths or topsoil contents. All OC and nutrient exports increased with longer cultivation over decadal time scales (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) to the same or greater extent than through deforestation and the first years of cultivation. Fluvial OC and total N losses were 2 and 21\xc2\xa0% of total SOC and total N decline, respectively, in the top 0.1\xc2\xa0m over 50\xc2\xa0years. Fluvial OC losses therefore played a minor role, and SOC losses were mainly a result of microbial mineralization. Resulting total N losses by stream discharge, however, were large with 31\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 after 50\xc2\xa0years of continuous cropping in comparison to fertilization of 40\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. Most (91\xc2\xa0%) of the N losses occurred as NO3 \xe2\x88\x92. In contrast, P losses by stream discharge were negligible in comparison to plant uptake. Water losses should be managed to reduce soil fertility declines especially through large N export from agricultural headwater catchments. However, stream concentrations of both P (0.01\xe2\x80\x930.15\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) and N (0.4\xe2\x80\x934.8\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) were moderate or low with respect to possible consequence for human health and not responsible for eutrophication observed in Lake Victoria.'

Abstract: "This paper reviews the lessons learned over the past 100 years in international management and conservation of the Earth's natural heritage and biological resources (fauna and flora), in the face of growing threats of degradation and extinction. The focus is on the effectiveness of intergovernmental and non-governmental institutions \xe2\x80\x93 in terms of agenda-setting, regime formation, implementation and compliance, and reactions to non-compliance. Among specific case histories analysed are the ivory trade ban, the whaling moratorium, and attempts at establishing an international forest regime. Innovative governance features highlighted in the field of global living resource management include active NGO participation, the use of selective economic incentives and disincentives (e.g. multilateral or bilateral trade sanctions), and a number of judicial enforcement remedies for both species-based and area-based conservation agreements. The paper concludes by assessing the prospects of transition from the paradigm of 'permanent sovereignty over natural resources' towards new concepts of public trusteeship and stewardship."

Abstract: 'The Stern Review has played an enormous role in making the world of business aware of the challenge of long-term climate change. In order to make real progress on the basis of this awareness, it is important to pay attention to the difference between human suffering and losses of gross domestic product (GDP). The Review has compared climate change to experiences of suffering like World War I. That war, however, hardly affected global GDP. The long-term damages to be expected from business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions include loss of the coastal cities of the world over the next millennia. This would be an act of unprecedented barbarism, regardless of whether it would slow down economic growth or perhaps even accelerate it. Business leaders worried about climate change need to pay attention to the tensions between ethical and economic concerns. Otherwise, a credibility crisis threatens global climate policy. An important step to establish the credibility needed for effective climate policy will be to gradually move towards a regime where emission permits are auctioned, not handed out as hidden subsidies. The revenues generated by permit auctions should be used to establish a global system of regional climate funds.'

Abstract: "Protected areas are considered some of the most versatile as well as important instruments of nature conservation and environmental policies. The `classic' model of nature conservation aims at the isolation of large areas in order to preserve their `pristine' nature from human interference. However, the transfer of this model to developing countries led to serious conflicts with local people. From a socio-geographical viewpoint, protected areas can be understood as regulative tools for the shaping and controlling of space. This approach helps to recognise the influence of distinct modes of appropriation of space and nature on the emergence and course of conflicts. In the present article it is used to analyse the leading role played by Brazilian NGOs in the transformation of the classic model of protected area management at the beginning of the nineties. Two case studies \xe2\x80\x93 dealing with the implementation of the Amazonian Mamirau\xc3\xa1 Reserve and with the reform of the Brazilian protected area legislation \xe2\x80\x93 are used to illustrate not only the success of the new approaches, but also the expectations and contradictions which surround the future development of protected areas in Brazil."

Abstract: 'The time course was investigated of the processing of \xe2\x80\x9cmissing\xe2\x80\x9d verbs in gapping constructions, such as John ate the hamburger, and Bill __ the hotdog. Native speakers of Dutch silently read Dutch sentences with and without gapping while their EEG was recorded. A left anterior negativity (LAN) was found at the first possible position at which the gapped verb could be detected, at least, for in participants who performed poorly in an end-of-sentence acceptability judgment task. This suggests that some readers do not anticipate the gapped verb, but infer the gapped verb in a bottom-up fashion, resulting in a LAN. Second, a P600 effect was observed for gapping versus no-gapping conditions, the early part of which was unaffected by plausibility. This suggests that the semantic and syntactic integration of a gapped verb is a relatively late process, and involves mechanisms similar to integrating a wh-phrase object with its verb.'

Abstract: ' One of the most species-rich ant-plant mutualisms worldwide is the palaeotropical Crematogaster-Macaranga system. Although the biogeography and ecology of both partners have been extensively studied, little is known about the temporal structuring and the dynamics of the association. In this study we compared life-history traits of the specific Crematogaster (Decacrema) partner-ants and followed the development of ant colonies on eight different Macaranga host plant species, from colony founding on saplings to adult trees in a snapshot fashion. We found differences in the onset of alate production, queen number and mode of colony founding in the ant species and examined the consequences of these differences for the mutualism with the host plant.'

Abstract: 'Edge effects are increasingly recognised as a threat to interior species, but the influence of edges on open habitats has rarely been addressed so far. We investigated the diversity pattern of the Orthoptera fauna across a habitat edge between a pine plantation and a natural steppe ecosystem. Thirty pitfall traps were positioned along a transect line from 80 m in the forest to 208 m in the grassland at 10 fixed distances from the edge. The orthopteran assemblage of the pine plantation was depauperate in species and individuals and, with a few exceptions, lacked steppe species. We found no increase in species richness at the forest\xe2\x80\x93grassland edge. In the grassland, Orthoptera species numbers increased steadily with increasing distance from the forest edge. Two-phase regression analysis revealed a traceable edge effect up to about 30 m into the grassland. This effect was exclusively caused by an increase in acridid species numbers, while tettigoniid species numbers showed no clear relation to edge distance. Correlation analysis of the habitat variables suggested that this pattern is a result of irradiance and soil temperature sums. Since acridids show species-specific temperature requirements for their development, shading of the soil surface prevents a number of species from completing their life cycle. We suggest that present trends of shrub encroachment and eutrophication of dry grassland habitats in eastern Austria are serious threats for a large part of the orthopteran fauna.'

Abstract: 'In this study bulk airborne aerosol composition measured by the PILS-IC (integration time of 3 min 24 s) during TRACE-P P3B Flight 10 are used to investigate the ionic chemical composition and mixing state of biomass burning particles. A biomass burning plume, roughly 3\xe2\x80\x934 days old, moderately influenced by urban pollution aerosols recorded in the Philippine Sea is investigated. Focusing on the fine particle NO3\xe2\x88\x92, SO42\xe2\x88\x92, K+, NH4+, and water-soluble organics, the observed correlations and nearly 1-to-1 molar ratios between K+ and NO3\xe2\x88\x92 and between NH4+ and (SO42\xe2\x88\x92+ inferred Organics) suggest the presence of fine-mode KNO3, (NH4)2SO4, and NH4(Organics) aerosols. Under the assumption that these ion pairs existed, and because KNO3 is thermodynamically less favored than K2SO4 in a mixture of NO3\xe2\x88\x92, SO42\xe2\x88\x92, K+, NH4+, and Organic anions, the measurements suggest that aerosols could be composed of biomass burning particles (KNO3) mixed to a large degree externally with the (NH4)2SO4 aerosols. A \xe2\x80\x9cclosed-mode\xe2\x80\x9d thermodynamic aerosol simulation predicts that a degree of external mixing (by SO42\xe2\x88\x92 mass) of 60 to 100% is necessary to achieve the observed ionic associations in terms of the existence of KNO3. However, the degree of external mixing is most likely larger than 90%, based on both the presence of KNO3 and the amounts of NH4NO3. Calculations are also shown that the aerosol mixing state significantly impacts particle growth by water condensation/evaporation. In the case of P3B Flight #10, the internal mixture is generally more hygroscopic than the external mixture. This method for estimating particle mixing state from bulk aerosol data is less definitive than single particle analysis, but because the data are quantitative, it may provide a complementary method to single particle chemical analysis.'

Abstract: 'Formation and closure of canopy gaps was monitored for three years in 12 ha of primary rain forest at Nouragues, French Guiana. At the first inventory, in April 1991, 74 openings in the canopy > 4 m2 (sensu Brokaw 1982a) were located; 60 of these gaps were formed before January 1990. Between January 1990 and December 1993, 5 to 15 gaps were annually formed, opening 0.64\xe2\x80\x931.33% of the forest canopy each year. Of all gaps, 41% were created by a falling, snapped tree, 34% by a falling, uprooted tree, 22% by a falling branch, and 3% by a falling dead stem. A refined nearest neighbour analysis showed that gaps formed after January 1990 were clustered: uprooting of trees seemed to be related to shallow soils, and relatively many other trees fell when a tree uprooted, independent of the dbh of the uprooted tree. In 37 gaps, canopy openness in the gap centre (determined by hemispherical photographs) was monitored over three years. In 54% of the gaps, canopy openness increased in two successive years. It is reasoned that edges of especially large gaps may frequently be re-disturbed by falling trees or branches. Results suggest that gaps have closed after around 15 years. More data are needed to verify this.'

Abstract: 'Land surface water (LSW) is one of the most important resources for human survival and development, and it is also a main component of global water recycling. A full understanding of the spatial distribution of land surface water and a continuous measuring of its dynamics can support to diagnose the global ecosystem and environment. Based on the Global Land 30-water 2000 and Global Land 30-water 2010 products, this research analyzed the spatial distribution pattern and temporal fluctuation of land surface water under scale-levels of global, latitude and longitude, continents, and climate zones. The Global Land 30-water products were corrected the temporal inconsistency of original remotely sensed data using MODIS time-series data, and then calculated the indices such as water area, water ration and coefficient of spatial variation for further analysis. Results show that total water area of land surface is about 3.68 million km2 (2010), and occupies 2.73% of land area. The spatial distribution of land surface water is extremely uneven and is gathered mainly in mid- to high-latitude area of the Northern Hemisphere and tropic area. The comparison of water ratio between 2000 and 2010 indicates the overall fluctuation is small but spatially differentiated. The Global Land 30-water products and the statistics provided the fundamental information for analyzing the spatial distribution pattern and temporal fluctuation of land surface water and diagnosing the global ecosystem and environment.'

Abstract: 'The exotic pepper species Capsicum baccatum, also known as the aji or Peruvian hot pepper, is comprised of wild and domesticated botanical forms. The species is a valuable source of new genes useful for improving fruit quality and disease resistance in C. annuum sweet bell and hot chile pepper. However, relatively little research has been conducted to characterize the species, thus limiting its utilization. The structure of genetic diversity in a plant germplasm collection is significantly influenced by its ecogeographical distribution. Together with DNA fingerprints derived from AFLP markers, we evaluated variation in fruit and plant morphology of plants collected across the species native range in South America and evaluated these characters in combination with the unique geography, climate and ecology at different sites where plants originated.'

Abstract: 'Organisms in polluted environments are typically exposed to a complex mixture of chemical contaminants. The great concern about the health of aquatic ecosystems has led to the increased use of biomarkers over the past years. The aim of this work was to review the papers published from 2000 to 2015, which used biomarkers to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems in Brazil. A research resulted in 99 eligible papers. More than 80% of studies were conducted in the states of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. Approximately 63% of studies used fish as bioindicator, whereas the micronucleus test and biochemical analyses were the most used biomarkers. A multibiomarker approach was used by 60.6% of studies, while 39.4% used one single biomarker. Furthermore, 68% were field studies and more than 75% of these used control animals sampled at reference sites. A relationship between the biomarker responses and pollution was reported by 87% of studies; however, 43.4% of studies analyzed only one sampling period, limiting comparisons and comprehension about possible seasonal variations. This review evidenced some weak points in studies using biomarkers in Brazil, especially related to the lack of studies in two important biomes (the Pantanal and the Amazon Rainforest) and experimental designs (small sample size, sampling in one single period, use of one single biomarker). Thus, future studies should consider mainly the use of multiple biomarkers, greater sample size, seasonal sampling and water physicochemical parameters to better diagnose the health of aquatic ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'The Atlantic Forest is one of the most diverse and threatened ecosystems of the world, being thus classified as one of the most important biodiversity hotspots. However, habitat loss, overexploitation, alien species, disease and pollution are not the only threats faced by native fauna and flora. The lack of adequate taxonomic knowledge hinders conservation and management efforts of endemic species. This is true even for mammals, which is the most charismatic group of animals and traditionally receive a good deal of attention from scientists and the public in general. A few examples show how this gap in local fauna information can be demise for species conservation, even misguiding management strategies: molecular data reveal a hidden marsupial diversity; the lack of taxonomic studies at the species level seriously threatens rodent conservation; and the taxonomic rearrangement of the genusBrachyteles revealed a new species and had a great impact on management strategies. New species are discovered, described and taxonomically rearranged at an astounding rate. We can only be successful in biodiversity conservation if we have at least a minimum level of knowledge about what we are trying to preserve. That is true both for researchers and for the general public. Recent taxonomic revisions may represent the turning point in Neotropical fauna knowledge, which, coupled with a greater awareness of local people about the rich biodiversity that dot their backyards, can represent a better conservation prospect for the endemics of the Atlantic Forest.'

Abstract: 'Organic carbon buried under the great ice sheets of the Northern Hemisphere is suggested to be the missing link in the atmospheric CO2 change over the glacial-interglacial cycles. At glaciation, the advancement of continental ice sheets buries vegetation and soil carbon accumulated during warmer periods. At deglaciation, this burial carbon is released back into the atmosphere. In a simulation over two glacial-interglacial cycles using a synchronously coupled atmosphere-land-ocean carbon model forced by reconstructed climate change, it is found that there is a 547-Gt terrestrial carbon release from glacial maximum to interglacial, resulting in a 60-Gt (about 30-ppmv) increase in the atmospheric CO2, with the remainder absorbed by the ocean in a scenario in which ocean acts as a passive buffer. This is in contrast to previous estimates of a land uptake at deglaciation. This carbon source originates from glacial burial, continental shelf, and other land areas in response to changes in ice cover, sea level, and climate. The input of light isotope enriched terrestrial carbon causes atmospheric \xce\xb413C to drop by about 0.3\xe2\x80\xb0 at deglaciation, followed by a rapid rise towards a high interglacial value in response to oceanic warming and regrowth on land. Together with other ocean based mechanisms such as change in ocean temperature, the glacial burial hypothesis may offer a full explanation of the observed 80\xe2\x80\x93100-ppmv atmospheric CO2 change.'

Abstract: 'This study focuses on the channel for improving environmental quality in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). Hence, we interact non-renewable electricity consumption with capital investment to determine the mediating role of capital investment in the nexus between electricity consumption and carbon emission in BRICS. This study applies the fully modified and the dynamic ordinary least squares techniques to conduct this scientific enquiry, and the result suggests that electricity consumption and growth positively and significantly enhance the level of emissions, while capital investment significantly reduces the level of emissions in BRICS. Also, capital investment interacts with non-renewable electricity consumption to improve environmental quality in both approaches employed, thereby reversing the earlier increase in emissions caused by electricity consumption. In addition, we confirm the proposition of the environmental Kuznets curve in BRICS and conclude that capital investment is an important channel for improving environmental quality.'

Abstract: 'Nutrient cycling and biomass characteristics of a tropical palm forest dominated byOrbignya cohune were found to be different from thsoe of hardwood dominated forests. The cohune palm forest had a high proportion of biomass in leaves (5%), a reduced sapling layer, a large amount of standing forest litter and an exceptionally low decomposition rate factor (0.1 year\xe2\x88\x921). Mineral concentrations in palm leaves were generally lower than in hardwood species with the exception of Na, which was exceptionally high inOrbignya cohune. Biomass was estimated at 226 tons ha\xe2\x88\x921 containing 1173 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 N; 126 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 P; 437 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 K; 1869 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 Mg; 125 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 Ca, and 2177 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 Na. Soils of cohune association did not differ significantly from those of neighbouring hardwood dominated associations with the exception of Na which occurred in higher concentration because of bioaccumulation in the dominant. The results suggest that the growth habits and physiology of a dominant can strongly influence some of the ecological parameters used to describe aforest association.'

Abstract: 'The rhizosphere microbiome is pivotal for plant health and growth, providing defence against pests and diseases, facilitating nutrient acquisition and helping plants to withstand abiotic stresses. Plants can actively recruit members of the soil microbial community for positive feedbacks, but the underlying mechanisms and plant traits that drive microbiome assembly and functions are largely unknown. Domestication of plant species has substantially contributed to human civilization, but also caused a strong decrease in the genetic diversity of modern crop cultivars that may have affected the ability of plants to establish beneficial associations with rhizosphere microbes. Here, we review how plants shape the rhizosphere microbiome and how domestication may have impacted rhizosphere microbiome assembly and functions via habitat expansion and via changes in crop management practices, root exudation, root architecture, and plant litter quality. We also propose a \xe2\x80\x9cback to the roots\xe2\x80\x9d framework that comprises the exploration of the microbiome of indigenous plants and their native habitats for the identification of plant and microbial traits with the ultimate goal to reinstate beneficial associations that may have been undermined during plant domestication.'

Abstract: 'A study was conducted for isolation, identification and antibacterial potential of fungal endophytes of Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers., (Bignoniaceae), a medicinal shrub vine plant which has long history for its usages in curing various disorders. A total of 149 isolates of endophytic fungi representing 17 fungal taxa were obtained from 270 segments (90 from each stem, leaf and petiole) of this plant. Hyphomycetes (77.85%) were the most prevalent, followed by Ascomycetes (8.05%) and Coelomycetes (4.03%) respectively. A considerable amount of fungal isolates was kept under (10.07%) Mycelia-Sterilia (MS). Leaf harboured maximum colonization of endophytic fungi (72.22%) which was greater than stem (67.78%) and petiole (25.54%). The Jc similarity index was maximum (0.619) between stem vs leaf followed by leaf vs petiole (0.571) and stem vs petiole (0.428). The dominant endophytic fungi were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Stenella agalis, Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia lunata and Fusarium roseum. Among twelve endophytic fungi tested for antibacterial activity, crude extracts of nine endophytic fungi (75%), showed antibacterial potential against one or more clinical human pathogens. Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Penicillium sp. and Chaetomium globosum exhibited significant antibacterial activity against 4 of 5 tested pathogens, showing broad spectrum activity. This investigation explains the value of sampling from different tissues of a host plant for the greater species diversity, and additionally, the antibacterial screening of some endophytic fungi from this specific medicinal plant may represent a unique source for many of the useful antibacterial compounds.'

Abstract: 'Societies with low-level food production economies occupy the vast and diverse middle ground between hunting\xe2\x80\x93fishing\xe2\x80\x93foraging and agriculture. Efforts by Ford, Harris, Rindos, Zvelebil, and others to characterize this \xe2\x80\x9cin-between\xe2\x80\x9d territory are discussed, and a new conceptual framework is proposed. Domestication, the central landmark of this middle ground, is situated well away from the boundaries with hunting\xe2\x80\x93gathering and agriculture, and separates low-level food production economies into two broad categories. Key issues and questions concerning societies with low-level food production, both with and without domesticates, are discussed. Hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherer and agriculture boundary zones on either side of the middle ground are considered, as are the developmental pathways that traverse them.'

Abstract: 'Allometric equations were generatedby harvesting tropical ash (Fraxinus uhdei(Wenzig) Lingelsh) trees growing on organic uplandssoils in the island of Hawaii. One of these equationswas used to estimate aboveground biomass of ten maturestands in the same area. Results indicated that theequation developed in situ, equations for white ash(Fraxinus americana L.), and generalizedfunctions for temperate and tropical forests, providedrelatively similar biomass estimates. Averagedifferences between biomass estimates from the testedequations (excluding the one for moist tropicalforests) and the function generated in situ rangedfrom 10 to 24%. One of the equations for white ashhad the lowest sum of residuals followed by thegeneralized equation for temperate forests. Theresults suggested commonality among biomass estimatesand, therefore, among relationships between treedimensions probably because most of the abovegroundtree biomass is in stem and branches, and thesecompartments are more stable than foliage mass. Equations to estimate commercial biomass and leaf areaof tropical ash are also provided.'

Abstract: 'The objective of this article is to analyse how green supply chain management (GSCM) practices are being adopted by some high-tech companies located in Brazil. The research was conducted using the case study approach, focusing on eight companies that are representative of this sector. The main results are: (a) the most adopted GSCM practices in the studied high-tech companies located in Brazil are internal environmental management, investment recovery and reverse logistics and (b) Brazilian environmental legislation and international policies are very important in driving the adoption of GSCM practices. The internationalisation of companies was also found to be a variable that interferes with the adoption of GSCM practices. This is one of the first studies that examine the relationship between GSCM and the internationalisation of companies located in Brazil.'

Abstract: 'The use of finely ground phosphate rocks (PRs) as directly applied P fertilizers in tropical farming systems is a cheaper alternative to acidulated, water-soluble P products. However, the effectiveness of PRs in tropical environments depends on the extent to which the required P uptake rate of the crop plant can be maintained by the rate of PR dissolution in that soil. That extent that this outcome is achieved depends on the properties of the PR, the soil, climate, plant factors, and on management practice. Environmental conditions in the surface layers of highly weathered soils in the humid tropics are generally conducive of the attainment of satisfactory rates of PR dissolution, especially as the reactivity of the PR increases. In soils with very high P sorption capacities, however, the agronomic effectiveness of PRs is reduced as the acquisition of dissolved P by plant roots is restricted by competition from P sorption processes in the soil.'

Abstract: 'Low light availability under a forest canopy often limits plant growth; however, sudden increase in light intensity may induce photoinhibition of photosynthesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ecophysiological changes that occur in potted plants of Minquartia guianensis and Swietenia macrophylla during the acclimation process to full sunlight. We used six full-sun independent acclimation periods (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days) and a control kept in the shade. Shading was obtained by placing plants under the canopy of a small forest. The Fv/Fm ratio, net photosynthetic rate (P N), the maximum carboxylation velocity of Rubisco (V cmax), maximum electron transport rate (J max), specific leaf area (SLA), and growth were assessed at the end of each of the six acclimation periods. Plant exposure to full sunlight caused a sudden decrease in the Fv/Fm ratio (photoinhibition) particularly in Minquartia. Photooxidation (necrotic patches) of the leaf tissue was observed in upper leaves of Minquartia. The higher P N values were observed in Swietenia under full sun, about 12 \xce\xbcmol(CO2) m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921. V cmax25 values were higher after 90 days of acclimation, about 14 \xce\xbcmol(CO2) m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 for Minquartia, and 35 \xce\xbcmol(CO2) m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 for Swietenia. At the end of a 180-d acclimation period J max25 was 35 \xce\xbcmol(electron) m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 for Minquartia and 60 \xce\xbcmol(electron) m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 for Swietenia. SLA was higher in Swietenia than in Minquartia. In Minquartia, monthly rate of leaf production per plant (MRLP) was positive (0.22 leaf month\xe2\x88\x921) after four months in the open. Whereas, in Swietenia MRLP was positive (0.56 leaf month\xe2\x88\x921) after an acclimation period of two months. After six months in the open, height growth rates were 3.5 and 28 mm month\xe2\x88\x921 for Minquartia and Swietenia, respectively. The greater acclimation capacity of Swietenia was associated to an enhanced photosynthetic plasticity under full sun. In Minquartia, transition to full-sun conditions and lack of physiological adjustment resulted in severe photoinhibition and loss of leaves.'

Abstract: 'Fish community structure was examined in 9 forested streams (1\xe2\x80\x936 m wide) in central Panama during dry seasons over a 3 year period. Study regions varied in annual rainfall, degree of canopy shading, and topographical relief. Benthic invertebrates were more abundant in riffles than in pools and more abundant in early (January) than late (March) dry season. In addition, benthos abundances were negatively correlated with canopy shading among study regions. Terrestrial invertebrate abundances were greater in January than March and were correlated with stream width. Fishes were assigned to 7 feeding guilds (algivores, aquatic insectivores, general insectivores, piscivores, scale-eaters, terrestrial herbivores, omnivores) on the basis of similarity of gut contents. Four species exhibited marked dietary shifts with increasing size. Distributions of feeding guilds (biomass) among habitats and streams were not generally correlated with availabilities of their major food resources. All feeding guilds except aquatic insectivores were most concentrated (biomass per area) into deep pools. Densities of algivores and terrestrial herbivores increased with stream size, but the density of aquatic insectivores declined. Species richness of feeding guilds increased with stream size and canopy openness. The proportion of fish biomass supported by algae and terrestrial plant material increased with stream size, while that supported by aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates declined. Small fishes (<40 mm TL) were most abundant in pools of small streams. Terrestrial predators appeared to be more important than food availability in determining distributions of fish among habitats. However, trophic diversity of fish communities may be related to the reliability of available food resources.'

Abstract: 'Merleau-Ponty\xe2\x80\x99s phenomenology of perception comprises two main levels of analysis: the description of the general foundation upon which all human perception occurs and that of the lived, situated aspects of perception, as experienced by individuals. These \xe2\x80\x98structural\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98situated\xe2\x80\x99 accounts of perception assume, respectively, the existence of a pre-personal body, which all human beings possess in principle, and of a historical body, which is the product of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98synchronization\xe2\x80\x99 with the world. A comprehensive and faithful description of human perceptual experience must contain, simultaneously, the general, structural, individual, and situational elements involved in perception. It has also to show the ways in which these elements impact each other, leading to distinct outcomes. I propose, here, a situated account of perception that fulfills these requisites while confirming Merleau-Ponty\xe2\x80\x99s insights and descriptions empirically, through cases of perceptual skill and learning in a large industrial plant near the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this article is to develop a theory which frames the demands of civil society in such a way as to better enable corporate subjects to manage and navigate \xe2\x80\x98irregular\xe2\x80\x99 engagement from activist organizations. Activist NGOs engage in advocacy at times by mounting, facilitating or encouraging popular social campaigns and actions against targeted corporations. In many cases, radical \xe2\x80\x98direct action\xe2\x80\x99 tactics are adopted, taking such approaches, NGOs may capitalise on the broader, more ethically diverse strategic possibilities open to them than are available to their corporate adversaries. We employ institutional theory to map out this asymmetric distribution of strategic possibility. We theorise NGOs and corporate subjects as effectively \xe2\x80\x98competing\xe2\x80\x99 with one another to maximise their own strategic possibilities and to minimise those of their opponents, in the perennial battle for hearts and minds that plays out between NGOs, corporate subjects, and broader civil society actors who ultimately determine boundary rules for NGO-corporate conflict. Within this context we explore the normative challenge arising from the possibility that corporate subjects might seek to tip the competitive balance by learning from how the military has adapted to successfully engage with \xe2\x80\x98irregular\xe2\x80\x99 adversaries through what is often termed \xe2\x80\x98asymmetric\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98irregular\xe2\x80\x99 warfare. Should corporations follow a similar adaptive process, by mirroring the \xe2\x80\x98irregular\xe2\x80\x99 strategies of activist groups? Drawing evidence from the military experience, we suggest\xe2\x80\x94perhaps counter intuitively\xe2\x80\x94that such adaptations can create new opportunities for conflict resolution and for building sustainable cooperation between former adversaries.'

Abstract: 'Forest certification has emerged as a marketing tool for linking the good forest management practices with the environmentally conscious consumers. Its genesis can be attributed to the society\xe2\x80\x99s concern for the social and environmental significance of forests. Forest management certification when coupled with the chain-of-custody certification; then, the supply chain stages for such forest products can carry an ecolabel. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are of socio-economic and cultural importance for the forest dwelling communities, particularly for the tropical countries like India. India is home to an amazing diversity of plants, with over 46,000 plant species recorded to occur there. NTFP\xe2\x80\x99s availability, utilization, commercialization, exploitation, management practices, policies and tenure systems in different parts of India have high diversity and variability. There is concern, however, that collection methods for most of NTFP species are destructive and wild populations are declining as a result. Thus, the harvest of NTFPs is coming under increasing scrutiny from certification programmes, as it plays a key role in the sustainable management of forest resources and community benefit worldwide. Thus, the present research paper highlights the issues relevant to certification of NTFPs in India, based on more than a decadal experience in dealing with this subject at Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal.'

Abstract: 'By maintaining a forest-like structure, shaded cocoa plantations contribute to the conservation of ants that usually live in the soil, leaf litter or canopy of tropical forests. Here we synthesize the available information on the diversity and community structure of ants in shaded cocoa plantations in the Atlantic forest region of Brazil, compare ant assemblages in cocoa agroforests with forests and other forms of agriculture, and discuss how these shaded plantations contribute to the conservation of the ants in the Atlantic Forest region. We also discuss ants of economical importance and of special interest, including Camponotus, Dolichoderus, Gnamptogenys, Pachycondyla, Pseudomyrmex and other litter dwelling genera. We discuss the situation of the tramp ant Wasmannia auropunctata in the Bahian cocoa-producing region where it is considered as native, and that of the two cryptobiotic genera Thaumatomyrmex and Typhlomyrmex, as well as that of proven and possible endangered army ant and Ponerini species. A total of 192 ant species from four strata were found in extensive sampling of a cocoa plantation with a relatively simple shade canopy (comprised primarily of Erythrina). Species richness in the cocoa plantations corresponded roughly to that of low diversity native forests, and species composition of cocoa plantations was most similar to native habitats (forest and mangroves) while ant composition in other agricultural habitats was most similar to that of urban areas. Although occurrences of Wasmannia auropunctata were similar in cocoa plantations and forests, abundance of Thaumatomyrmex and Typhlomyrmex, generally thought to be rare ants, was relatively high in cocoa plantations. These results, from cocoa plantations with relatively simple shade, demonstrate the importance of cocoa for ant conservation in the Atlantic forest region of Brazil. It is likely that cocoa plantations with a greater number of vegetation strata and higher tree species richness (such as traditional cabruca plantations) provide even more important habitat for ants generally and for ant species of conservation concern.'

Abstract: 'Resource utilization by nine abundant piscivores from a diverse tropical fish assemblage was examined over the course of a year. All nine species exhibited peak reproduction during the early wet season and a similar sequence of size-dependent shifts from a diet composed primarily of microcrustacea, to aquatic insects, and finally fishes. Three piranha species specialized on fish fins, particularly at subadult size classes (SL 30\xe2\x80\x9380 mm). Gradual dessication of the floodplain during the transition season was associated with fish growth, increased fish density, and decreased aquatic primary productivity and availability of invertebrate prey. Based on 118 resource categories, average pairwise diet overlap was low during all three seasons: wet, transition, and dry. Of 72 species pairings, only one pair of fin-nipping piranhas exhibited high overlap simultaneously on three niche dimensions: food type, food size, and habitat. Adults of two species, a gymnotid knifefish and pimelodid catfish, were largely nocturnal. Patterns of habitat utilization indicate that piranhas may restrict diurnal use of the open-water region by other piscivores. Collective diet overlap of individual piscivore species with the other eight feeding guild members and collective overlaps with the entire fish community each revealed two basic seasonal trends. Four species that showed an early switch to piscivory also showed a high degree of diet separation with both the guild and community at large on a year-round basis. The five remaining species showed lowest collective diet overlaps during the transition season when availability of invertebrates was reduced and fish densities were maximal. Whereas predation may play a role in habitat separation, diffuse competition for food resources during the approximately four-month transition season probably is the principal factor yielding patterns of diet specialization.'

Abstract: 'Field studies of respiration in stream insects are few in comparison with laboratory studies. To evaluate the influence of temperature and oxygen along altitudinal gradients we measured the respiration rate of fully acclimatized larval Trichoptera, Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera under similar field conditions in streams from 400 to 3800\xc2\xa0m above sea level in tropical Ecuador. Mean active respiration rates of the animals at 3800\xc2\xa0m were approximately half of those at 400\xc2\xa0m. Trichoptera showed a slightly larger difference in respiration with altitude than Ephemeroptera. Comparative respiration measurements at 100 and 50% oxygen saturation indicated that highland animals reduced their oxygen uptake more than their counterparts in the lowland when oxygen availability decreased. The temperature response of respiration calculated between the insect assemblages at different altitudes showed a mean assemblage Q10\xe2\x88\x92value of 1.50. Trichopteran larvae had a slightly stronger temperature response (Q10 of 1.68) than ephemeropterans (Q10 of 1.30). These community Q10-values are considerably lower than the mean value of 2.36 found in single species in the laboratory. The weak community-wide response of respiration to temperature in tropical streams is probably due to full acclimatization of the component species to stable and narrow temperature ranges. Adaptations to the low oxygen availability at high altitude probably consist of a suite of genetic physiological and behavioural features.'

Abstract: "During the last 10 years, contours have been developing of a new scientific field with a focus on the political aspects of environmental problems in the tropics. Ton Dietz suggests that political environmental geography - or what others call 'political ecology' - is now questioning the extent to which governments and NGOs influence the way people use their resources and manage their environment. The issues at stake are not so much the technical and organizational aspects of environmental management, but the power structures behind the causes of environmental problems and behind the attempts at solving them."

Abstract: 'Allergic diseases are distributed worldwide and their risk factors and triggers vary according to geographical and socioeconomic conditions. Allergies are frequent in the Tropics but aspects of their prevalence, natural history, risk factors, sensitizers and triggers are not well defined and some are expected to be different from those in temperate zone countries. The aim of this review is to investigate if allergic diseases in the Tropics have particularities that deserve special attention for research and clinical practice. Such information will help to form a better understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management\xc2\xa0of allergic diseases in the Tropics. As expected, we found particularities in the Tropics that merit further study because they strongly affect the natural history of common allergic diseases; most of them related to climate conditions that favor permanent exposure to mite allergens, helminth infections and stinging insects. In addition, we detected several unmet needs in important areas which should be investigated and solved by collaborative efforts led by the emergent research groups on allergy from tropical countries.'

Abstract: 'Non-human primates are our closest relatives and represent an interesting model for comparative parasitological studies. However, research on this topic particularly in relation to intestinal parasites has been fragmentary and limited mainly to animals held in captivity. Thus, our knowledge of host-parasite relationships in this species-rich group of mammals could be considered rudimentary. The current study combined morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular analyses to characterize isolates of intestinal tetratrichomonads recovered from the feces of three species of South American, non-human primates. Fecal samples were collected from 16 animals, representing 12 distinct species. Parabasalid-like organisms were evident in five samples (31%) of feces: two from Alouatta sara, two from Callithrix penicillata, and one from Sapajus apella. The five samples presented morphologies consistent with the description of Tetratrichomonas sp., with four anterior flagella of unequal length, a well-developed undulating membrane, and a long recurrent flagellum. Sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S rRNA-ITS2 region demonstrated that the isolates from A. sara, and C. penicillata were closely related and highly similar to isolates of Tetratrichomonas brumpti, recovered previously from tortoises (Geochelone sp.). The flagellate recovered from S. apella demonstrated a similar morphology to those of the other isolates, however, sequence analysis showed it to be identical to an isolate of Tetratrichomonas sp. recovered from white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari). The findings of this study extend and enhance our knowledge of parasitism of non-human primates by members of the genus Tetratrichomonas and indicate that the host range of these parasites is broader than previously believed.'

Abstract: 'A couple of decades ago, the international community started questioning the existing neoliberal economic model and at the same time opened a debate about the new path to follow.

Abstract: 'As global landscapes continue to change, the sustainability of the ecosystem services they support are increasingly coming into question.

Abstract: 'Environmental radionuclides (40K, 137Cs, 210Pb, 226Ra) were determined in soils under semi-arid stands, a transition area from thorn to deciduous forest in El Angolo, and heath stands in the Alto Mayo in Northern Peru in order to elucidate their activity level in soil, and to trace underground environment in remote areas of little anthropogenic intervention. Anthropogenic 137Cs was only found in the uppermost portion of the soils in small amount, whereas the 210Pb activity was exceptionally high at the soil surfaces in a tropical stand of Alto Mayo. The results suggest a fallout nuclide, 210Pb, having been transported from local source(s) not to be specified yet.'

Abstract: 'With the increasing concerns related to integration of social and economic dimensions of the sustainability into life cycle assessment (LCA), traditional LCA approach has been transformed into a new concept, which is called as life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). This study aims to contribute the existing LCSA framework by integrating several social and economic indicators to demonstrate the usefulness of input\xe2\x80\x93output modeling on quantifying sustainability impacts. Additionally, inclusion of all indirect supply chain-related impacts provides an economy-wide analysis and a macro-level LCSA. Current research also aims to identify and outline economic, social, and environmental impacts, termed as triple bottom line (TBL), of the US residential and commercial buildings encompassing building construction, operation, and disposal phases.'

Abstract: ' Bark properties (mainly thickness) are usually presented as the main explanation for tree survival in intense fires. Savanna fires are mild, frequent, and supposed to affect tree recruitment rather than adult survival: trunk profile and growth rate of young trees between two successive fires can also affect survival. These factors and fire severity were measured on a sample of 20 trees near the recruitment stage of two savanna species chosen for their contrasted fire resistance strategies (Crossopteryx febrifuga and Piliostigma thonningii). Crossopteryx has a higher intrinsic resistance to fire (bark properties) than Piliostigma: a 20-mm-diameter stem of Crossopteryx survives exposure to 650\xc2\xb0C, while Piliostigma needs a diameter of at least 40\xe2\x80\x89mm to survive. Crossopteryx has a thicker trunk than Piliostigma: for two trees of the same height, the basal diameter of Crossopteryx will be 1.6 times greater. Piliostigma grows 2.26 times faster than Crossopteryx between two successive fires. The two species have different fire resistance strategies: one relies on resistance of aboveground structures to fire, while the other relies on its ability to quickly re-build aboveground structures. Crossopteryx is able to recruit in almost any fire conditions while Piliostigma needs locally or temporarily milder fire conditions. In savannas, fire resistance is a complex property which cannot be assessed simply by measuring only one of its components, such as bark thickness. Bark properties, trunk profile and growth rate define strategies of fire resistance. Fire resistance may interact with competition: we suggest that differences in fire resistance strategies have important effects on the structure and dynamics of savanna ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'We analyzed diatoms in a sediment profile from Laguna Zoncho in southern Pacific Costa Rica (lake elevation 1190\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0asl, depth 2.6\xc2\xa0m, area 0.75\xc2\xa0ha) spanning some 3240\xc2\xa0cal \xc2\xa0yr. Diatoms are common in the profile, which we subdivide into three zones. Zone C (\xe2\x88\xbc3240\xe2\x80\x931020\xc2\xa0cal \xc2\xa0yr B.P.) is dominated by Staurosira construens var. venter and Aulacoseira spp.; during this time, the lake was dilute and circumneutral. Benthic and acidophilous taxa increase gradually in the upper section of this zone. Zone B (\xe2\x88\xbc1020\xe2\x80\x93460\xc2\xa0cal \xc2\xa0yr B.P.) almost totally lacks Aulacoseira, and instead is dominated by combinations of Eunotia minor, Encyonema lunatum, Gomphonema gracile, and Pinnularia braunii. Previous pollen and charcoal analysis indicates that this zone falls within the peak of prehistoric agricultural activity at the lake, but diatoms may also reflect climate change. During this period, the lake was likely shallower and more acidic, but not eutrophic. Finally, Zone A (\xe2\x88\xbc460\xc2\xa0cal \xc2\xa0yr B.P. to AD 1997) begins near a 1.5-cm tephra layer from nearby Volc\xc3\xa1n Bar\xc3\xba; diatom assemblages are dominated by Aulacoseira spp., and suggest deepening of the lake and return to conditions similar to Zone C. This was a time of indigenous population decline and forest recovery in the Zoncho region, probably reflecting the impact of European diseases on the native population, although climate change and impacts of the tephra deposition cannot be wholly discounted.'

Abstract: 'Earth System Models (ESMs) are fundamental tools for understanding climate-carbon feedback. An ESM version of the Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System model (FGOALS) was recently developed within the IPCC AR5 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) modeling framework, and we describe the development of this model through the coupling of a dynamic global vegetation and terrestrial carbon model with FGOALS-s2. The performance of the coupled model is evaluated as follows.'

Abstract: 'The antibiotic hypothesis proposes that ant pollination is rare at least in part because the cuticular antimicrobial secretions of ants are toxic to pollen grains. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of ants and bees on pollen in two regions: a tropical rainforest in Amazonian Peru and temperate forests and old fields in Canada. We found support for three predictions that follow from the antibiotic hypothesis. (1) For all 10 ant and 11 plant species in our study, contact with ants significantly reduced pollen germination, confirming the generality of this effect. (2) Contact with two bee species did not have similar effects; pollen exposed to bees germinated as well as control pollen. (3) Consistent with the presumed greater abundance of entomopathogens in the tropics, which may have selected for stronger antibiotic secretions in tropical ants, tropical ants had more negative effects on pollen than temperate ants. We speculate that the antibiotic hypothesis contributes not only to the rarity but also to the biogeography of ant pollination, and we discuss whether the negative effects of ants on pollen have resulted in selection for floral defenses against ants.'

Abstract: 'Nitrogen is often a limiting factor to net primary productivity (NPP) and other processes in terrestrial ecosystems. In most temperate freshwater ecosystems, when nitrogen becomes limiting to NPP, populations of N-fixing cyanobacteria experience a competitive advantage, and begin to grow and fix nitrogen until the next most limiting resource is encountered; typically phosphorus or light. Why is it that N-fixing plants do not generally function to overcome N limitation in terrestrial ecosystems in the same way that cyanobacteria function in aquatic ecosystems? To address this question in a particular ecosystem, one must first know whether the flora includes a potential set of nitrogen fixers. I suggest that the presence or absence of N-fixing plant symbioses is foremost an evolutionary consideration, determined to a large extent by constraints on the geographical radiation of woody members of the family Fabaceae. Ecological factors such as competition, nutrient deficiencies, grazing and fire are useful to explain the success of N-fixing plants only when considered against the geographical distribution of potential N-fixers.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the productivity of three premontane primary forest sites in an extremely nutrient-poor environment on the Guyana shield in SE Venezuela. Aboveground litter production (total 5.58; leaves 4.30\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921) was low, but comparable to other tropical forests. Due to the low nutrient status, net production of fine roots was among the highest ever reported (11.14\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921). Only 20% of fine root stock was alive, 80% consisted of necromass. Similar values were obtained for dead and living root tips. Element concentrations in fine roots (including bio- and necromass), especially Ca, were low, whereas Al concentrations were relatively high.'

Abstract: 'Recent work in the philosophy of biology has attempted to clarify and defend the use of the biodiversity concept in conservation science. I argue against these views, and give reasons to think that the biodiversity concept is a poor fit for the role we want it to play in conservation biology on both empirical and conceptual grounds. Against pluralists, who hold that biodiversity consists of distinct but correlated properties of natural systems, I argue that the supposed correlations between these properties are not tight enough to warrant treating and measuring them as a bundle. I additionally argue that deflationary theories of biodiversity don\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough, since a large proportion of what we value in the environment falls outside bounds of what could reasonably be called \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity\xe2\x80\x9d. I suggest that in current scientific practice biodiversity is generally an unnecessary placeholder for biological value of all sorts, and that we are better off eliminating it from conservation biology, or at least drastically reducing its role.'

Abstract: "The Matses Indians of northeastern Per\xc3\xba recognize two linguistically labeled folk species of saki monkeys (Cebidae: Pithecia) that are said to be morphologically distinguishable, to prefer different habitats, and to be noninterbreeding. Because the systematic literature recognizes only one biological taxon of Pithecia in the area inhabited by the Matses, their folk taxonomy suggests either the presence of a previously undescribed species or a hitherto undocumented range extension. All known species of Pithecia are currently thought to be allopatric, so both possibilities are of interest. We obtained blood samples and anatomical voucher material from hunters' kills in order to test the biological basis for the Matses folk taxonomy of sakis. Molecular and morphological analyses of the collected material indicate that both Matses folk species correspond to one effectively panmictic population of Pithecia monachus. Overdifferentiation in folk classification systems, whereby one biological species is represented by two or more nonsynonymous folk species names, is a potentially widespread source of error that should be considered by researchers using local informants for primate field studies. In addition to resolving a folk-taxonomic enigma, our study provides the first quantitative analyses of local (within-population) morphological and molecular variation in this little-known platyrrhine genus."

Abstract: 'Understanding spatio-temporal patterns in rainfall received beneath tropical forest is required for eco- hydrological modelling of soil-water status, river behaviour, soil erosion, nutrient loss and wet-canopy evaporation. As selective-logging of tropical forest leaves a very complex mosaic of canopy types, it is likely to add to the spatio-temporal complexity of this sub-canopy or net precipitation. As a precursor to addressing this problem, the analysis presented here will examine the two dominant biophysical controls on sub-canopy precipitation. These controls are: (a)\xc2\xa0the spatial and temporal patterns in above-canopy or gross rainfall, and (b)\xc2\xa0the rate of wet-canopy evaporation associated with each type of canopy structure created by selective-forestry. For this study, over 400 raingauges were installed within a 10\xc2\xa0km2 area of lowland dipterocarp forest affected by selective-forestry some 9-years prior to this work. Gauges were located beneath various canopy types and within large openings. The spatial distribution of gross rainfall (monitored within the openings) was modelled using variography, while the effects of different canopy types on sub-canopy preciptation was analysed by comparing 6-month totals. The temporal distribution of gross rainfall over an 11-year record collected at the same site (Danum Valley Field Centre) was modelled with Data-Based-Mechanistic (DBM) approaches. These DBM approaches were also applied to the rainfall time-series of the two adjacent meteorological stations; all three gauges being contained within a 5000\xc2\xa0km2 region of Eastern Sabah in Malaysian Borneo.'

Abstract: 'Soils and forest floor were sampled quantitatively from a montane wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico to determine the spatial variability of soil nutrients, the factors controlling nutrient availability to vegetation, and the distribution of nutrients in soil and plants. Exchangeable cation concentrations were measured using different soil extracting procedures (fresh soil with NH4Cl, air-dried and ground soil with KCl, and a Modified Olsen solution) to establish a range of nutrient availability in the soil, and to determine the relationship between different, but commonly used laboratory protocols.'

Abstract: 'Soil organisms play a central role in the decomposition of organic matter. The activity of soil organisms was comparatively examined in three experimental sites in central Amazonia (Brazil): a peach palm monoculture (Bactris gasipaes) a, rubber tree plantation (Hevea sp.), and an agroforestry system (four tree species planted in rows, the space between covered by upcoming secondary vegetation). The overall decomposition rates in the systems and the role of different groups of soil organisms (macrofauna, mesofauna, microflora) were studied with leaf litter (Vismia guianensis) enclosed in litter bags. Microbial respiration and biomass (SIR method) in litter and soil were measured (IRGA). Microbial respiration in all sites decreased in the gradient litter > topsoil (0\xe2\x80\x935 cm) > soil at 5\xe2\x80\x9315 cm. The highest decomposition rate was always observed in the litter bags of coarse mesh size, pointing to the crucial role of the macrofauna in maintaining a high decomposition rate of the organic material in all systems. The Hevea (k = 3.4) and the Bactris plantation (k=3.1) both showed the highest decomposition rates, followed by the polyculture system (k=1.9). The Bactris plantation also had the highest level of microbial respiration and biomass in litter and soil. We discuss these findings in the light of data on rainfall, pH and canopy closure. They suggest that microclimate is a more important factor than biomass in determining litter decomposition rates and activity of soil organisms at these sites.'

Abstract: 'Structure, species composition, and soil properties of a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in Okinawa, Japan, were examined by establishment of plots at thirty sites. The forest was characterized by a relatively low canopy and a large number of small-diameter trees. Mean canopy height for this forest was 10 m and stands contained an average of 5400 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 (\xe2\x89\xa73.0 cm DBH); 64% of those stems were smaller than 10 cm DBH. The total basal area was 54.4 m 2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, of which Castanopsis sieboldii contributed 48%. The forest showed high species diversity of trees. 80 tree species (\xe2\x89\xa7 3.0 cm DBH) from 31 families was identified in the thirty sampling plots. C. sieboldii and Schima wallichii were the dominant and subdominant species in terms of importance value. The mean tree species diversity indices for the plots were, 3.36 for Diversity index (H\xe2\x80\xb2), 0.71 for Equitability index (J\xe2\x80\xb2) and 4.72 for Species richness index (S\xe2\x80\xb2), all of which strongly declined with the increase of importance value of the dominant, C. sieboldii. Measures of soil nutrients indicated low fertility, extreme heterogeneity and possible Al toxicity. Regression analysis showed that stem density and the dominant tree height were significantly correlated with soil pH. There was a significant positive relationship between species diversity index and soil exchangeable K+, Ca2+, and Ca2+/Al3+ ratio (all p values <0.001) and a negative relationship with N, C and P. The results suggest that soil property is a major factor influencing forest composition and structure within the subtropical forest in Okinawa.'

Abstract: 'Though the affinity of iron oxides and hydroxides for phosphorus (P) is thought to limit growth and productivity of plants on iron-rich acidic soils in humid tropical climate, tall trees are found in tropical rainforests, and vigorous growth occurs in herbaceous vegetation in the humid tropical climate of the Andamans. Our study reports how high rainfall influences Bray and Kurtz P-1 extractable P, water filled pore space (WFPS), microbial biomass carbon (MB-C) and phosphorus (MB-P) in the gravelly-sandy-loamy soils in three major land use systems: moist-evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest and homegarden, in the equatorial humid tropical climate of South Andaman island of India. In addition, an ex-situ experiment investigated how labile carbon (glucose) under different soil-water regimes [25% field capacity (FC) and 100% FC] affected the P in the soils under the land use systems. WFPS, across the land use systems, was more than two times higher during the high rainfall than dry spell (72\xe2\x80\x9380\xc2\xa0hr after the high rainfall). The extractable P, across the land use systems, increased about 5 to 6 fold during the high rainfall than dry spell. The increase was the highest in the homegarden and lowest in moist-evergreen forest. The extractable P was positively correlated with the WFPS. MB-C and MB-P were lower during the high rainfall than dry spell in all the land use systems. In the ex-situ experiment, the extractable P increased 1.4 to 1.7 fold more in water (100% FC) + glucose than water (100% FC) alone treatment. Water at 25% FC did not increase the extractable P in the soils under all the land use systems. After cessation of the high rainfall, WFPS declined quickly within 2-hr in the upper layer (0\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0cm) of the soils. These indicate that the high rainfall together with labile carbon increases the extractable P through anaerobiosis, whereas, quick decline in the WFPS (0\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0cm) following cessation of the high rainfall helps its uptake by plants and microflora.'

Abstract: 'We present characteristics of eight microsatellite loci isolated from Minquartia guianensis Aubl (Olacaceae), an ecological and economically important forest tree species from Central and South America. Polymorphism was tested in two natural populations detecting 2 to 18 alleles per locus. The expected heterozygosities (H E) range from 0.313 to 0.903. Linkage disequilibrium was found only at two locus combination in one population. High exclusion probability was estimated. These markers turn to be useful for population genetics and gene flow studies in this threatened timber species from the Neotropics.'

Abstract: 'This study documents the abundance, distribution and knowledge of medicinal plant species in a Ransa Dayak village and adjoining forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Over 250 medicinal plant species from 165 genera and 75 families are utilized by the local healer. Late successional, primary and river bench forests contained the highest diversity of locally-utilized medicinal species and the greatest number of species restricted to a single forest type for which alternative species or remedies were unavailable. Epiphytes and trees restricted to primary forests are particularly important sources for plants used to treat unusual ailments. A 100% survey of village residents 15 years of age and older (N = 32) revealed that people older than 25 years of age, and older females in particular, possessed greater knowledge of medicinal plants and their uses than younger people and males. All residents, except the male healer, were more knowledgeable about medicinal plants found in early successional forests than those of primary forests. Commercial logging and the loss of traditional knowledge through acculturation pose twin challenges to the persistence of traditional medicinal plant use in this Ransa village and throughout much of Kalimantan.'

Abstract: 'This research investigates spatial patterns of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and rainfall variability in South America and their relationships based on analyses of the Standardized Difference Vegetation Index (SDVI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for the period April 1998\xe2\x80\x93March 2012. The time series of SPOT-Vegetation 10-daily composite NDVI data at 1-km resolution was smoothed and subsequently synthesized to monthly images using the maximum value composite technique. Furthermore, 10-daily rainfall estimates at 0.25\xc2\xb0 resolution, available from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts through MeteoConsult and the Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS unit, were combined to retrieve monthly composites. In order to assess spatial patterns and rates of change, linear least squares trend analyses were performed on the SDVI time series and the SPI time series, taking into account the accumulated rainfall over the respective best lag. Only trends with Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s correlation coefficients significantly different from zero (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) were considered significant. The results indicated that vegetation degradation is coupled to a significant decrease in the amount of rainfall in the last 14\xc2\xa0years in 8\xc2\xa0% of South America\xe2\x80\x99s area. In contrast, in 18\xc2\xa0% of the subcontinental area, vegetation greenness has significantly increased over the last 14\xc2\xa0years, coupled to an increase in rainfall. For 46\xc2\xa0% of the study area, significant degradation or greening processes could not be linked to changes in rainfall over time, indicating human impact or the influence of other climatic factors, such as temperature and net radiation.\n'

Abstract: 'Worldwide concern for continuing loss of montane forest cover in the tropics usually focuses on adverse ecological consequences. Less recognized, but equally important to inhabitants of these affected regions, is an increasing susceptibility to rainfall-induced debris flows and their associated impacts. The same high rainfall rates that sustain tropical forest cover can often serve as the triggering mechanism for debris flows. The natural rate of debris flow occurrence on steep slopes subject to episodic, intense rainfall is dependent on the stabilizing effect of tropical forests. Either loss or significant reduction in forest cover can weaken this natural defense. Information from postdisaster observations and research on the November 1988 storm event in southern Thailand provides a case study illustrating the potential impacts of increased debris flow susceptibility resulting from conversion of forest cover to rubber tree crops. Development resulting in the loss of tropical forest cover may be accompanied by local increase in population, property development, and infrastructure. Consequently, the potentially disastrous consequences of increased debris flow occurrence are amplified by the greater vulnerability of local populations. Preserving the tropical forest cover is an obvious and often difficult means of retaining this natural protection. Effective policy should capitalize on the values of tropical forests as part of the strategy for retaining adequate forest cover. Policy should also seek to avoid creating pressures that foster forest removal or their conversion to other types of land cover in steep terrain. Areas where tropical forests were converted to other cover types can be restored to secondary forests to avoid a permanent state of increased debris flow susceptibility. Restoration of secondary tropical forests can successfully re-establish the forest characteristics that limit debris flow occurrence. Experience in Central America and the Caribbean demonstrates that successful restoration is possible but requires a significant commitment of both time and resources. In addition to the cost and technical difficulties involved, the increased susceptibility to debris flow occurrence persists through many years until successful restoration is achieved. Both retention of existing tropical forests and restoration of forest cover where loss has occurred are often justified by the reduced risk of debris flow impacts to vulnerable populations and infrastructure.'

Abstract: 'Transnational city networks (TCNs) are organisations that facilitate information exchange, cooperation and lobbying activities of cities from different countries\xe2\x80\x94independent of the national level. This paper compares the aims and goals of European and Asian city networks, asking if there are significant differences between the two regions or if certain global patterns of urban international relations can be identified. The analytical concept draws on the literature on European TCNs and identifies specific functions they provide to their membership. By way of a comparative analysis, this concept is extended to the Asian TCN cases. It is shown that in both regions, cities cooperate independently across national borders, circumventing the nation-state. Furthermore, sustainable development with a strong focus on environmental issues, and in particular climate change policy, is the most important policy goal in both Europe and Asia. The TCNs show major differences, however, in the areas of representation of and lobbying on behalf of their memberships. This leads to the conclusions that cities emancipate themselves from the higher tiers of government and that the Westphalian nation state loses coherence in both Europe and Asia, even though to specific degrees.'

Abstract: 'Land use/cover change has occurred at all times in all parts of the world. Most affected and involved in these processes are the environmental spheres of water, soil, and vegetative cover, which are closely linked to geomorphology, climate, fauna, and especially human societies. These linkages between spheres are highly complex and, as of yet, incompletely understood. The most profound questions with respect to land use/cover and global change are: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat forces drive land use/land cover change?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat impacts \xe2\x80\x94 direct and indirect, now and in the future \xe2\x80\x94 do these changes have on the environment and on human society?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCan and should we, and if so, how, respond to these changes?\xe2\x80\x9d This partial teaching module, developed under the auspices of the Second Commission on College Geography of the Association of American Geographers, introduces students to the complexities inherent in these questions, but mainly focusses on the first of these. It illustrates the central role of the study of land land use/cover change within the large field of global environmental and climatic change, and is thus a good unit to introduce this area of interest.'

Abstract: 'This article examines three common generalizations from the literature on Latin American environmentalism. The validity of these generalizations, structured as hypotheses, is tested with four case studies from Costa Rica, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil. The first generalization is that tensions arise between international environmentalists principally concerned with wildlands conservation and national environmentalists engaged in a broader array of local and domestic issues including urban environmental quality and access to natural resources. The second is that environmental groups in Latin America are elitist in structure and participant base. The third is that the particular tactics employed by environmentalists will be closely tied to the relative openness of their nation\xe2\x80\x99s political system. Through a cross-disciplinary case study approach we find the first two hypotheses quickly break down upon closer inspection, while the third is supported. We suggest a modified framework for interpreting environmental activism in the region, one that weights the role of the state as well as the competing strategies employed by grassroots, private voluntary, and professionalized environmental groups. Latin American environmentalism is highly diverse, presenting many faces in different time periods and different countries. Developing one general theory of environmentalism in Latin America is impossible, but more specific categorizations of the middle range may be achievable.'

Abstract: 'Evapotranspiration (ET) is the largest term after precipitation in terrestrial water budgets. Accurate estimates of ET are needed for numerous agricultural and natural resource management tasks and to project changes in hydrological cycles due to potential climate change. We explore recent methods that combine vegetation indices (VI) from satellites with ground measurements of actual ET (ETa) and meteorological data to project ETa over a wide range of biome types and scales of measurement, from local to global estimates. The majority of these use time-series imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the Terra satellite to project ET over seasons and years. The review explores the theoretical basis for the methods, the types of ancillary data needed, and their accuracy and limitations. Coefficients of determination between modeled ETa and measured ETa are in the range of 0.45\xe2\x80\x930.95, and root mean square errors are in the range of 10\xe2\x80\x9330% of mean ETa values across biomes, similar to methods that use thermal infrared bands to estimate ETa and within the range of accuracy of the ground measurements by which they are calibrated or validated. The advent of frequent-return satellites such as Terra and planed replacement platforms, and the increasing number of moisture and carbon flux tower sites over the globe, have made these methods feasible. Examples of operational algorithms for ET in agricultural and natural ecosystems are presented. The goal of the review is to enable potential end-users from different disciplines to adapt these methods to new applications that require spatially-distributed ET estimates.'

Abstract: 'In advance of an updated monographic revision of Swartzia (Leguminosae), we discuss the taxonomy of the genus in extra-Amazonian Brazil and present descriptions of five new species. All of the new species are narrowly distributed in eastern Brazil in threatened Atlantic wet forest and coastal scrub habitats. Four of them\xe2\x80\x94S. alagoensis, S. arenophila, S. revoluta, and S. submontana \xe2\x80\x94belong to the diverse and taxonomically challenging section Acutifoliae, which has undergone extensive evolutionary radiation in the region. The fifth, S. thomasii, is a member of the otherwise Amazonian section Glabriplantae and is only subtly distinct from the Amazonian species S. reticulata. The new species and other recent additions to the genus are incorporated in a key to the species of Swartzia of extra-Amazonian Brazil.'

Abstract: 'Habitat loss and fragmentation are significant threats for primate species worldwide. However, few attempts have been made to look for general patterns in primate responses to habitat loss and fragmentation, or whether these may be associated with species\xe2\x80\x99 traits. We conducted a review of published literature on effects of patch size to quantify the effect of a reduction in this predictor on primates, and to determine whether these effects depend on species\xe2\x80\x99 traits. The effects of patch size on seven response variables (density, parasite prevalence and diversity, presence, genetic diversity, time spent feeding, resting and movement), were extracted from 135 papers and compared across six species traits (diet specialisation, social structure, body size, home range size, group size and dispersal ability). We found that density, parasitic prevalence and diversity and time spent feeding were positively associated with a reduction in patch size, while species\xe2\x80\x99 presence and genetic diversity were negatively associated. Time spent resting and moving did not show clear patterns. We found little evidence that the effect of patch size varies consistently with traits. This study provides important evidence for the consistent effect of patch size on a range of factors that influence the dynamics of primate populations. However, there is a need to move beyond quantifying patch size effects alone and to quantify the effects of changes occurring at broader landscape scales. This would allow more holistic primate conservation strategies to be developed across whole landscapes rather than being focussed on the management of individual patches.\n'

Abstract: 'The Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is an economically important product to the Brazilian Amazon. Currently, its marketing is being affected by the high incidence of aflatoxins (AF) produced by potentially aflatoxigenic fungi associated with its seeds. In this context, the purpose of this study was to determine which part of the nut contributes to contamination by aflatoxins and to identify the mycobiota in Brazil nut samples. Unshelled and shelled nuts were analyzed by measuring the total count of filamentous fungi (Aspergillus sections Flavi, Nigri and Circumdati) in sanitised and non-sanitised treatments. The isolates identified as Aspergillus section Flavi, the major producers of AF, were plated for determination of their aflatoxigenic potential. To perform the AF analysis, samples of Brazil nuts were treated separately. The AF from the shell and kernel were extracted by chloroform and analysed by the HPLC-FD system in isocratic mode. The Aspergillus section Flavi count was 21.67% lower. The production of AF by the isolated fungi was 30% for sanitised and 23.8% for non-sanitised samples. The concentrations obtained of AFB1 and AFG1 were higher than those of AFB2 and AFG2. The AFB1 concentrations of shelled nuts and shell samples were 35.0 and 1.78\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/kg, respectively. AFB2 and AFG2 were detected only in shelled nut samples. The HPLC-FD analysis presented limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 0.2 and 0.4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/kg, respectively.'

Abstract: 'Samples of the fraction of net rainfall passing through the forest floor collected at monthly intervals in four pristine forests in Colombian Amazonia, during the period between 1995\xe2\x80\x931997 were analysed for solute concentrations to estimate the element fluxes from the forest floor into the mineral soil and root nutrient uptake from these forest floors. Results were compared with inputs by throughfall, stemflow, litterfall and fine root decay. Element concentrations were tested for their relationship with litterflow amounts, rainfall intensity and length of the antecedent dry period and differences in element fluxes between ecosystems were assessed. Concentrations of elements in litterflow followed a similar pattern as those in throughfall, which indicates that element outputs from the forest floor are strongly related to those inputs in throughfall. In the forests studied, the average concentrations of elements as K, Mg, orthoP and the pH of the litterflow decreased relative to that in throughfall in most events, while the concentration of elements such as dissolved organic carbon, H, SO4 and Si increased in litterflow from these forests. Element concentrations in litterflow showed a poor correlation with variables such as litterflow amounts, rainfall intensity and antecedent dry period, except for K which showed a significant correlation (p>0.95) with analysed variables in all forests. Outputs were significantly different between forests (p>0.95); these fluxes, which particularly concerned cations, being the largest in the flood plain, while for anions outputs increased from the flood plain to the sedimentary plain. After adding the nutrient contributed by litter decomposition and fine root decay, the net outputs of main elements from the forest floors were still smaller than inputs by net precipitation (throughfall\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89stemflow) indicating that the litter layers clearly acted as a sink for most nutrients. Accordingly, the element balances confirm that the forest floors acted as a sink for nutrients coming in by throughfall, stemflow, litterfall and fine root decomposition. P, Mg and N appeared to be the most limiting nutrients and the forests studied efficiently recycled these nutrients.'

Abstract: 'This assessment of the atmospheric methane budget for the African Continent is based on a set of experimental data obtained in tropical Africa including methane emission from various biogenic sources, and biomass burning, and methane consumption in savanna and forest soils. Emission rates from the various sources, uptake rates of soils, and complementary data from the litterature allow calculation of regional methane fluxes by means of different data bases. Biomass burning, animals and natural wetlands are the three dominant sources of methane in Africa while rice paddy fields and termites appear as minor sources. The total methane emission is estimated to be in the range 20\xe2\x80\x9340 MT of CH4 per year, methane uptake by soils being less than 2 MT per year. Net methane emission from the African continent accounts for less than 10% of global emissions from terrestrial ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Sustainability science has emerged within an essentially modern framework. We start from discussing the inherent contradictions and paradoxes of this framing model and then move to a new pragmatic defining space, articulated through a plurality of epistemologies, languages, styles of research, experiences, and actions, all coming from a global civil society and defining a variety of epistemic and normative stances and methods. We then propose and explore a scenario in which sustainability is fruitfully hybridized with artistic research and practice, with local agricultural practice and indigenous culture, and, finally, with animal culture for \xe2\x80\x9cnonhuman\xe2\x80\x9d knowledge and rights. These hybrids can work as encouragements to abandon modern divides and pitfalls and engage in a new kind of collective diagnose and praxis for our present.'

Abstract: 'This study highlights spatial characterization of evergreen forests of the Western Ghats \xe2\x80\x93 an ecological hotspot in Tamil Nadu, India \xe2\x80\x93 using remote sensing and GIS-based analysis in conjunction with ground-based phytosociological data. The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only 15\xe2\x80\x9328% of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.'

Abstract: 'We characterize the vegetation types of the upper basin of the Madeira River in the Brazilan state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia, a biodiverse region with elevated rates of habitat loss. Vegetation and environmental parameters were recorded from 37 observation points distributed along and near a 160 km stretch of the Madeira River and representing the range of regional environments. Analysis of structure and floristic variables, as well as associated edaphic attributes and water table fluctuation, permitted recognition of five main vegetation types and seven subtypes. Open Ombrophilous Forest was the most frequently encountered vegetation type and occurred on well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, whereas Dense Ombrophilous Forest was seldom recorded. Alluvial Ombrophilous Forests (v\xc3\xa1rzea) were found along a narrow strip of land along the banks of the Madeira River on the most fertile soils in the study area. Semideciduous Forests were found on small areas of rocky outcrops with shallow soils and reduced water availability during the dry season. Campinaranas, which range from open savanna physiognomies to closed canopy forests, were found to be a key environment in the lowlands south of the Madeira River on silty hydromorphic soils, where they harbor a peculiar flora tolerant of flooding during the rainy season. Our classification of the main vegetation types in the upper Madeira River illuminates a high degree of floristic and environmental heterogeneity in a highly threatened region. Our results will be useful for designing conservation strategies aimed at protecting the full range of floristic diversity present in the region.'

Abstract: 'We examine the global mean surface temperature and carbon cycle responses to the A1B emissions scenario for a new 57 member perturbed-parameter ensemble of simulations generated using the fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-carbon cycle climate model HadCM3C. The model variants feature simultaneous perturbation to parameters that control atmosphere, ocean, land carbon cycle and sulphur cycle processes in this Earth system model, and is the first experiment of its kind. The experimental design, based on four earlier ensembles with parameters varied within each individual Earth system component, allows the effects of interactions between uncertainties in the different components to be explored. A large spread in response is obtained, with atmospheric CO2 at the end of the twenty-first century ranging from 615 to 1,100\xc2\xa0ppm. On average though, the mean effect of the parameter perturbations is to significantly reduce the amount of atmospheric CO2 compared to that seen in the standard HadCM3C model. Global temperature change for 2090\xe2\x80\x932099 relative to the pre-industrial period ranges from 2.2 to 7.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, with large temperature responses occurring when atmospheric model versions with high climate sensitivities are combined with carbon cycle components that emit large amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere under warming. A simple climate model, tuned to reproduce the responses of the separate Earth system component ensembles, is used to demonstrate that interactions between uncertainties in the different components play a significant role in determining the spread of responses in global mean surface temperature. This ensemble explores a wide range of interactions and response, and therefore provides a useful resource for the provision of regional climate projections and associated uncertainties.'

Abstract: 'We compared soil nutrient availability and soil physical properties among four treatments (high-intensity fire, low-intensity fire, plant removal, and harvesting gap) and a control (intact forest understory) over a period of 18 months in a tropical dry forest in Bolivia. The effect of treatments on plant growth was tested using a shade intolerant tree species (Anadenanthera colubrina Vell. Conc.) as a bioassay. Surface soils in high-intensity fire treatments had significantly greater pH values, concentrations of extractable calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P), and amounts of resin-available P and nitrogen (N) than other treatments; however, a loss of soil organic matter during high-intensity fires likely resulted in increased bulk density and strength, and decreased water infiltration rates. Low intensity fires also significantly increased soil pH, concentrations of extractable Ca, K, Mg, and P, and amounts of resin-available P and N, although to a lesser degree than high-intensity fires. Low-intensity fires did not lower soil organic matter contents or alter soil physical properties. Plant removal and harvesting gap treatments had little effect on soil chemical and physical properties. Despite the potentially negative effects of degraded soil structure on plant growth, growth of A. colubrina seedlings were greater following high-intensity fires. Evidently, the increase in nutrient availability caused by high-intensity fires was not offset by degraded soil structure in its effects on seedling growth. Long-term effects of high intensity fires require further research.'

Abstract: 'The diversity of cassava was studied in 10 communities spanning a range of socio-economic circumstances and located in the four main agro-ecological zones in Ghana. On average, each farmer grew about two cultivars, mostly landraces, both for home consumption and sale of the storage roots. In total, 35 differently-named landraces were mentioned, 26 in only single communities. Most communities had grown cassava for > 100 years and seem to have acquired an additional landrace about every decade. Landraces were also abandoned. The attributes mentioned of newly-acquired landraces were generally the reverse of landraces abandoned and most were related to the storage roots. All the current landraces in all the communities seem to have been obtained from other communities. None of the almost 300 interviewed farmers understood the role of pollination in setting seed and providing variation amongst seedlings, none purposely planted seeds and most farmers ignored or weeded out cassava seedlings. However, some did use planting material (stem cuttings) from self-sown seedlings, often when planting material from their crops was scarce, and some purposely grew cuttings from a few such seedlings, apparently as experiments. That many seedlings were both reported and seen in newly-planted crops suggests that some may be accidentally used as planting material, especially those seedlings that are perceptually indistinct from the planted crop, resulting in polyclonal landraces.'

Abstract: 'This study assessed the socioecological resilience of family farms in three land reform settlements in Mato Grosso, Brazil, located in the ecologically threatened Cerrado biome. Using focus groups, a household survey, and analysis of soil samples we characterized farming systems and quantified indicators of resilience, which we contextualized with a qualitative analysis of distributions of power and access to rights and resources. In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity, plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and access to stable markets. Our pilot study suggests that the convergence of grassroots mobilization and political-institutional change is a central leverage point for developing more resilient food systems.'

Abstract: 'This study was performed to estimate the emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) from biomass burning at a large fire area. The extended methodology adopted the IPCC Guidelines (2003) equation for use on data from the Samcheok forest fire gathered using 30 m resolution Landsat TM satellite imagery, digital forest type maps, and growing stock information per hectare by forest type in 1999. Normalized burn ratio (NBR) technique was employed to analyze the area and severity of the Samcheok forest fire that occurred in 2000. The differences between NBR from pre- and post-fire datasets are examined to determine the extent and degree of change detected from burning. The results of burn severity analysis by dNBR of the Samcheok forest fire area revealed that a total of 16,200 ha of forest were burned. The proportion of the area characterized by a \xe2\x80\x98Low\xe2\x80\x99 burn severity (dNBR below 152) was 35%, with \xe2\x80\x98Moderate\xe2\x80\x99 (dNBR 153\xe2\x80\x93190) and \xe2\x80\x98High\xe2\x80\x99 (dNBR 191\xe2\x80\x93255) areas were at 33% and 32%, respectively. The combustion efficiency for burn severity was calculated as 0.43 for crown fire where burn severity was \xe2\x80\x98High\xe2\x80\x99, as 0.40 for \xe2\x80\x98Moderate\xe2\x80\x99 severity, and 0.15 for \xe2\x80\x98Low\xe2\x80\x99 severity surface fire. The emission factors for estimating non-CO2 GHGs were separately applied to CO 130, CH4 9, NOx 0.7 and N2O 0.11. Non-CO2 GHGs emissions from biomass burning in the Samcheok forest fire area were estimated to be CO 44.100, CH4 3.053, NOx 0.238 and N2O 0.038 Gg.'

Abstract: 'Soil as an impurity in sugarcane is a serious problem for the ethanol industry, increasing production and maintenance costs and reducing the productivity. Fe, Hf, Sc and Th determined by INAA were used as tracers to assess the amount of soil in sugarcane from truckloads as well as in the juice extraction process. Quality control tools were applied to results identifying the need for stratification according to soil type and moisture. Soil levels of truckloads had high variability indicating potential for improving cut and loading operations. Samples from the juice extraction process allowed tracking the soil in the mill tandem.'

Abstract: 'Two new species of Gymnopus (G. atlanticus and G. talisiae) from Northeast Brazil and the neotropical G. montagnei are described, illustrated and treated here under a polyphasic taxonomical perspective. According to our phylogenetic analyses (ITS rDNA), sequences of these three species grouped with other taxa of Gymnopus sect. Impudicae, forming a well-supported monophyletic clade. These results confirm the placement of the treated species within Gymnopus sect. Impudicae, as well as suggesting that this section represents a natural and monophyletic group, with its morphological limits, however, in a need of re-evaluation.'

Abstract: 'Brazilian agriculture is now expanding toward the Amazon region, where large new areas of virgin lands are being brought under cultivation. There is therefore an urgent need to better understand the conditions and characteristics of the soils of that region. In this study a Red Yellow Podzol and a Yellow Latosol were used to examine urea transport and transformation in the laboratory under water-saturated conditions. The soils were collected in an area that was deforested in 1976 and planted to tropical fruits since then.'

Abstract: 'Understanding how archaeological sites are abandoned is a vital part of archaeology. This paper explores abandonment as a phenomenon in a worldwide context, particularly in relation to sites with evidence of fire, and with a special focus on the South-Central Andes. I evaluate the patterns from an area of the Argentinian Andes and discuss the disappearance of the Aguada Culture, one of the central cultures in Argentinian prehistory, using evidence from the core area the Ambato Valley. I conclude that environmental factors were not the sole or determining source of stress, but rather part of a social\xe2\x80\x93environmental dimension in which several factors combined to push a society into a vulnerable situation. In terms of the abandonment of the Aguada settlements in the Ambato Valley, the study shows that frequent forest fires might have played a role, but based upon the regularity of such events as seen in the sediment history, it is unlikely that these were the only factor in the process of abandonment of the valley.'

Abstract: 'To date, most studies of light- and nutrient-limited primary productivity in forested streams have been carried out in deciduous forests of temperate, continental regions. Conceptual models of light and nutrient limitation have been developed from these studies, but their restricted geographic range reduces the generality of such models. Unlike temperate continental streams, streams on tropical high islands are characterized by flashy, unpredictable discharge and riparian canopies that do not vary seasonally. These contrasting conditions suggest that patterns of light and nutrient limitation in tropical streams may differ from those in temperate streams. The effects of light, and nitrogen and phosphorus availability on periphyton accrual (measured as chlorophyll a per unit area) were investigated using field experiments in 4 low-order streams on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Levels of chlorophyll a in partially-shaded stream pools were significantly greater than in heavily-shaded pools, and nutrient-enrichment increased the level of chlorophyll a in partially-shaded pools but not in heavily-shaded pools. In each stream, phosphate enrichment resulted in an increase in the level of chlorophyll a, but nitrate enrichment had no effect. Spates following rainstorms occur frequently in these streams, and may increase periphyton productivity by increasing the flux of nutrients to algal cells. However, differences in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations measured during spates and baseflow were small, and during some spates, concentrations of these two nutrients declined relative to baseflow concentrations. These observations suggest that phosphorus limitation was not alleviated by spates.'

Abstract: 'Balancing ever-increasing agricultural and biofuel needs with biodiversity conservation is one of the greatest challenges facing conservation biologists in the 21st century. The conversion of\xc2\xa0>75 million hectares of forests in Brazilian Amazonia over four decades for agropastoral uses has resulted in the \xe2\x80\x98creation\xe2\x80\x99 of a similar-sized amount of non-forest \xe2\x80\x98agricultural matrix\xe2\x80\x99 habitats. Despite extensive research on the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on the Amazonian biota, the value of increasingly larger areas of non-forest habitat for forest wildlife remains poorly understood. We conducted 325 fixed-radius point counts of the avifaunal assemblage of non-forest vegetation within a 1200-km2 region along the Amazonian \xe2\x80\x98Arc of Deforestation\xe2\x80\x99 in Northern Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our sampling included 2,814 records of 164 species, 15 and 54% of which were recorded in more than 10% and fewer than 2% of all sampling sites, respectively. In particular, nearly 70% of the regional scale avifauna of 560 species failed to use the agricultural matrix, regardless of the persistence of ameliorating structural features, such as isolated trees. At the local scale, higher species richness in the agricultural matrix was best predicted by the presence of relictual trees, and to a lesser extent by standing water and scrubby habitats. The presence of relictual trees, rather than scrub, predicted the occurrence of those forest-dependent species that did use the agricultural matrix. Our results indicate that intensive agricultural production coupled with land sparing would better suit conservation of vulnerable forest species than more extensive \xe2\x80\x98wildlife friendly\xe2\x80\x99 agricultural practices that require more land under production to produce the same yield.'

Abstract: 'Previous experimental investigations have suggested that guaran\xc3\xa1 (Paullinia cupana Kunth, supplied by EMBRAPA Oriental) consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases and has positive effects on lipid metabolism, mainly related to low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels.

Abstract: 'Tropical montane cloud forest is one of the ecosystems with the highest biomass worldwide, representing an important carbon store. Globally its deforestation index is \xe2\x80\x931.1%, but in Mexico it is higher than \xe2\x80\x933%. Carbon estimates are scarce globally, particularly in Mexico. The objective of this study was to simulate future land-cover scenarios for the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico, by analyzing past forest cover changes. Another objective was to estimate stored carbon in the two study areas. These objectives involve the generation of information that could be useful inputs to anti-deforestation public policy such as the REDD+ strategy. Remote sensing was used to measure land cover change and estimate carbon stocks. Satellite images from 2015, 2000 and 1986 were used, and Dinamica EGO freeware generated models of future projections. Between 1986 and 2015, 5171 ha of forest were converted to pasture. The annual deforestation rates were \xe2\x80\x931.5% for Tlanchinol and \xe2\x80\x931.3% for the San Bartolo Tutotepec sites. Distance to roads and marginalization were highly correlated with deforestation. By 2030, an estimated 3608 ha of forest in these sites will have been converted to pasture. Stored carbon was estimated at 16.35 Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 for the Tlanchinol site and 12.7 Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 for the San Bartolo site. In the Sierra Madre Oriental deforestation due to land cover change (\xe2\x80\x931.4%) is higher than levels reported worldwide. Besides having high values of stored carbon (14.5 Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921), these forests have high biodiversity. The models\xe2\x80\x99 outputs show that the deforestation process will continue if action is not taken to avoid the expansion of livestock pasturing. This can be done by paying incentives for forest conservation to the owners of the land. The results suggest that REDD+ is currently the most viable strategy for reducing deforestation rates in tropical montane cloud forests in Sierra Madre Oriental.'

Abstract: 'Sources of variation among the chemical and spectral properties of tropical forest canopies are poorly understood, yet chemical traits reveal potential ecosystem and phylogenetic controls, and spectral linkages to chemical traits are needed for remote sensing of functional and biological diversity. We analyzed 21 leaf traits in 395 fully sunlit canopies, representing 232 species and multiple growth forms, in a lowland mixed dipterocarp forest of Sarawak, Malaysia. Leaf traits related to light capture and growth (for example, photosynthetic pigments, nutrients) were up to 55% lower, and defense traits (for example, phenols, lignin) were 15\xe2\x80\x9340% higher, in the dominant family Dipterocarpaceae and in its genus Shorea, as compared to all other canopy species. The chemical variation within Dipterocarpaceae and Shorea was equivalent to that of all other canopy species combined, highlighting the role that a single phylogenetic branch can play in creating canopy chemical diversity. Seventeen of 21 traits had more than 50% of their variation explained by taxonomic grouping, and at least 16 traits show a connection to remotely sensed spectroscopic signatures (RMSE\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa015%). It is through these chemical-to-spectral linkages that studies of functional and biological diversity interactions become possible at larger spatial scales, thereby improving our understanding of the role of species in tropical forest ecosystem dynamics.'

Abstract: "Jorge Lobo's disease (Lacaziosis) is a subcutaneous infection of humans living in the Amazon region of Latin America, and in dolphins inhabiting the east coastal areas of the United States. The disease mainly affects people from rural areas living or working in close contact with vegetation and aquatic environments. Most patients refer having developed lesions after accidental trauma with plant thorns or insect bites. Inter-human transmission has never been confirmed suggesting that Lacazia loboi is acquired from environmental propagules."

Abstract: 'Two related segregating populations of Theobroma cacao L. were analysed for their resistance to Phytophthora palmivora. The first F1 population was obtained by crossing two susceptible cacao clones of Catongo (a highly homozygous genotype) and Pound 12(a highly heterozygous genotype) and the second population was obtained by backcrossing a single F1 tree with Catongo. The genetic maps obtained for each population were compared. The F1 map includes 162 loci and the backcross has 140 loci. The two maps, F1 and BC1, exhibit high co-linear loci organization covering respectively, 772 and 944 cM.Phytophthora resistance was assessed by measuring the size increase of a lesion at five (DL5)and ten days (DL10) after pod inoculation. Six different QTL were detected in the F1 and BC1 populations. One QTL was found in both populations, and appeared to be a major component of disease resistance, and explaining nearly 48% of the phenotypic variance in the F1 population. The absence of some yield QTL detection in the BC1 in comparison with the F1 population is due to the lack of transmission of the favouring alleles for these QTL from the single F1 tree used for the backcross. The phenotypic variance explained by the action of the quantitative trait alleles indicated that genetic factors of both major and minor effects were involved in the control of the character studied. QTL conferring increased resistance to Phytophthorawere identified in both susceptible parents, suggesting the presence of transgressive traits and the possibility of selection in cacao. Pleiotropic and epistatic effects for the QTL were also detected. Finally, the use of marker assisted selection (MAS) in cacao breeding programs is discussed.'

Abstract: 'This paper treats the identification of modeled images of cucurbits \xe2\x80\x94gourds and squash\xe2\x80\x94in the ceramics of the Late Formative Era (or Chorrera culture) of coastal Ecuador (ca. 900 B.C. to 100 A.D.). These images provide good evidence for the sophisticated cultivation of cucurbits by the native peoples of the coast of South America from very early time periods in Ecuador. Their importance in the iconography of Late Formative cultures certainly demonstrates that the domestication of fruits with both hard and soft rinds must have been well established by the time ceramic production had begun. Depictions of combinations of animals with cucurbit-shaped bodies in the mortuary ceramics of the Late Formative period also demonstrate that cucurbits were an essential part of life (and death) on the coast of Ecuador.'

Abstract: 'The relationship between photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and leaf nitrogen concentration (N) among all C3 species can be described roughly with one general equation, yet within that overall pattern species groups or individual species may have markedly different Amax-N relationships. To determine whether one or several predictive, fundamental Amax-N relationships exist for temperate trees we measured Amax, specific leaf area (SLA) and N in 22 broad-leaved deciduous and 9 needle-leaved evergreen tree species in Wisconsin, United States. For broad-leaved deciduous trees, mass-based Amax was highly correlated with leaf N (r2=0.75, P<0.001). For evergreen conifers, mass-based Amax was also correlated with leaf N (r2=0.59, P<0.001) and the slope of the regression (rate of increase of Amax per unit increase in N) was lower (P<0.001) by two-thirds than in the broad-leaved species (1.9 vs. 6.4 \xce\xbcmol CO2 g\xe2\x88\x921 N s\xe2\x88\x921), consistent with predictions based on tropical rain forest trees of short vs. long leaf life-span. On an area basis, there was a strong Amax-N correlation among deciduous species (r2=0.78, P<0.001) and no correlation (r2=0.03, P>0.25) in the evergreen conifers. Compared to deciduous trees at a common leaf N (mass or area basis), evergreen trees had lower Amax and SLA. For all data pooled, both leaf N and Amax on a mass basis were correlated (r2=0.6) with SLA; in contrast, area-based leaf N scaled tightly with SLA (r2=0.81), but area-based Amax did not (r2=0.06) because of low Amax per unit N in the evergreen conifers. Multiple regression analysis of all data pooled showed that both N (mass or area basis) and SLA were significantly (P<0.001) related to Amax on mass (r2=0.80) and area (r2=0.55) bases, respectively. These results provide further evidence that Amax-N relationships are fundamentally different for ecologically distinct species groups with differing suites of foliage characteristics: species with long leaf life-spans and low SLA, whether broad-leaved or needle-leaved, tend to have lower Amax per unit leaf N and a lower slope and higher intercept of the Amax-N relation than do species with shorter leaf life-span and higher SLA. A single global Amax-N equation overestimates and underestimates Amax for temperate trees at the upper and lower end of their leaf N range, respectively. Users of Amax-N relationships in modeling photosynthesis in different ecosystems should appreciate the strengths and limitations of regression equations based on different species groupings.'

Abstract: 'Recent studies suggest that carbon (C) is stored in the topsoil of pastures established after deforestation. However, little is known about the long-term capacity of tropical pastures to sequester C in different soil layers after deforestation. Deep soil layers are generally not taken into consideration or are underestimated when C storage is calculated. Here we show that in French Guiana, the C stored in the deep soil layers contributes significantly to C stocks down to a depth of 100\xc2\xa0cm and that C is sequestered in recalcitrant soil organic matter in the soil below a depth of 20\xc2\xa0cm. The contribution of the 50\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0cm soil layer increased from 22 to 31\xc2\xa0% with the age of the pasture. We show that long-term C sequestration in C4 tropical pastures is linked to the development of C3 species (legumes and shrubs), which increase both inputs of N into the ecosystem and the C:N ratio of soil organic matter. The deep soil under old pastures contained more C3 carbon than the native forest. If C sequestration in the deep soil is taken into account, our results suggest that the soil C stock in pastures in Amazonia would be higher with sustainable pasture management, in particular by promoting the development of legumes already in place and by introducing new species.'

Abstract: "The effect of seed aggregation and distance from conspecific trees on seed predation was experimentally examined for two neotropical tree species, Macoubea guianensis (Apocynaceae) and Pouteria sp. (Sapotaceae) in a lowland tropical rain forest in northeastern Peru. Results of these experiments are discussed in the context of the Janzen-Connell model (Janzen 1970; Connell 1971), which predicts decreased seed survival near parent trees due to either density-or distance-responsive mortality, and Howe's model (Howe 1989) which predicts that trees with seeds dispersed in clumps (aggregated) will not suffer density-dependent predation, and will have higher survival of seeds near the parent tree than other trees. We also examined whether predation on seeds of these species was affected by seed placement in or near 30-m-wide strips regenerating after clear-cutting. Both species appeared to be mammal-dispersed but differed in how frugivores handled seeds, seed size, overall fruit crop size, and gemination time. Neither of the two species studied appeared to suffer seed predation in a manner predicted by the Janzen-Connell model, and patterns of seed predation for only one of the species was similar to predictions of Howe's model. For neither species did seed predation along the edge of, or in the center of, regenerating clear cuts differ from predation 15 m into the primary forest. For Pouteria, seed predation in and near regnerating strips was significantly greater than around forest trees, but the opposite pattern held for Macoubea. Overall, seed predation was much greater on Macoubea. The difference in seed predation for these two species was most likely a result of differences in the types of seed predators that attacked these two species."

Abstract: "This work focuses on plant-based preparations that the Aguaruna Jivaro of Peru give to hunting dogs. Many plants are considered to improve dogs' sense of smell or stimulate them to hunt better, while others treat common illnesses that prevent dogs from hunting. This work places canine ethnoveterinary medicine within the larger context of Aguaruna ethnomedicine, by testing the following hypotheses: H1 -- Plants that the Aguaruna use to treat dogs will be the same plants that they use to treat people and H2 -- Plants that are used to treat both people and dogs will be used for the same illnesses in both cases."

Abstract: 'The Yanomami are a hunter-gatherer and gardener people with high mobility, which influences the regeneration of forest in agricultural clearings. Increasing contact with the wider Brazilian and Venezuelan societies may lead to sedentarization. Population groups and clearings were mapped in the Yanomami Land in Brazil using four mosaics of Landsat images from within a two-year period. The mosaics were separated by intervals of 7\xc2\xa0years. Few groups were sedentary, and most of these maintained alternative residences. The Yanomami cleared 16,856\xc2\xa0ha (0.17% of the Yanomami territory in Brazil) over the 21\xc2\xa0years covered by this study. Individuals in mobile groups deforested more than those in sedentary groups, but secondary-forest regeneration occurs mainly in clearings made by mobile groups. Permanent settlements had impeded regeneration of 48% (2,025\xc2\xa0ha) of the area cleared prior to 1988. Access to health care has led to population growth but has not increased sedentarization.'

Abstract: 'Phlebotomine sand flies are dipterans of the family Psychodidae. They are very important to veterinary medicine because some species are vectors of infective forms of Leishmania spp., the etiological agents of leishmaniasis. The Parque Estadual do Rio Doce is located in an area with constant reports of cases of leishmaniasis. In order to better understanding the phlebotamine sand fly fauna of the park, the present work was undertaken with the goal of analyzing phlebotomine sand flies collected there, verifying their seasonality and correlating their presence with forest and/or anthropic areas.'

Abstract: 'This paper describes a Bayesian methodology for prediction of multivariate probability distribution functions (PDFs) for transient regional climate change. The approach is based upon PDFs for the equilibrium response to doubled carbon dioxide, derived from a comprehensive sampling of uncertainties in modelling of surface and atmospheric processes, and constrained by multiannual mean observations of recent climate. These PDFs are sampled and scaled by global mean temperature predicted by a Simple Climate Model (SCM), in order to emulate corresponding transient responses. The sampled projections are then reweighted, based upon the likelihood that they correctly replicate observed historical changes in surface temperature, and combined to provide PDFs for 20\xc2\xa0year averages of regional temperature and precipitation changes to the end of the twenty-first century, for the A1B emissions scenario. The PDFs also account for modelling uncertainties associated with aerosol forcing, ocean heat uptake and the terrestrial carbon cycle, sampled using SCM configurations calibrated to the response of perturbed physics ensembles generated using the Hadley Centre climate model HadCM3, and other international climate model simulations. Weighting the projections using observational metrics of recent mean climate is found to be as effective at constraining the future transient response as metrics based on historical trends. The spread in global temperature response due to modelling uncertainty in the carbon cycle feedbacks is determined to be about 65\xe2\x80\x9380\xc2\xa0% of the spread arising from uncertainties in modelling atmospheric, oceanic and aerosol processes of the climate system. Early twenty-first century aerosol forcing is found to be extremely unlikely to be less than \xe2\x88\x921.7\xc2\xa0W\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922. Our technique provides a rigorous and formal method of combining several lines of evidence used in the previous IPCC expert assessment of the Transient Climate Response. The 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of our observationally constrained PDF for the Transient Climate Response are 1.6, 2.0 and 2.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C respectively, compared with the 10\xe2\x80\x9390\xc2\xa0% range of 1.0\xe2\x80\x933.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C assessed by the IPCC.'

Abstract: "This paper presents the botanical and historical evidence for the role of African rice (O. glaberrima) and slaves in the crop's introduction to the Americas during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By focusing on culture, technology, and the environment the research challenges the perspective of the Columbian Exchange that emphasizes the diffusion of crops to, rather than from Africa, by Europeans. The evidence presented in this paper suggests a crucial role for glaberrima rice and slaves in the introduction of African crops to the Americas."

Abstract: 'Multi-drug resistant forms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) are a major source of nosocomial infections and when discharged into streams and rivers from hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWWTP) they are known to be able to persist for extended periods. In the city of Manaus (Western Brazilian Amazon), the effluent of three HWWTPs feed into the urban Mindu stream which crosses the city from its rainforest source before draining into the Rio Negro. The stream is routinely used by Manaus residents for bathing and cleaning (of clothes as well as domestic utensils) and, during periods of flooding, can contaminate wells used for drinking water.'

Abstract: 'The prevailing archaeological consensus on Paleoindian origins and colonization of the Americas has been shaken by recent wide acknowledgment of pre-Clovis occupation at Monte Verde, Chile, and by claims that ostensibly non-Mongoloid skeletal remains might represent a precursor population. Recent mitochondrial DNA studies have been interpreted by some as indicating an earlier and more complex peopling of the continent. This paper reviews the current archaeological and biological evidence, in America and northern Asia, for the origins of Native Americans, assesses models of the colonization process in the light of new data and a revised chronology, and suggests avenues for future research.'

Abstract: "Visitation of orchids by Meliponini (stingless bees) is confirmed only in 13Melipona, Partamona andTrigona, forXylobium andMaxillaria, with the addition ofTrigona fulviventris visitingIonopsis. Some bees evinced multiple floral visitation by carrying several stipes and viscidia from pollinaria, thus may cause seed set. None foraged pseudopollen, nor is collection of this substance by bees verified. Meliponine-visited orchids had pollinia in quartets with emplacement on the bee's scutellum, possibly devices for pollinia survival on a social bee passing through its nest. Further, orchids produced no nectar, but bees repeatedly came to flowers. A testable basis for the orchid-meliponine relationship is mimicry of rewarding resources, or bee pheromone mimicry, recently documented for some honey bees. Meliponine pheromone analogs (nerol and 2-heptanol) are here noted forMaxillaria, but lack of foraging with pheromones byMelipona suggests multiple avenues of mimicry by orchids, including alarm pheromone and carrion mimicry."

Abstract: 'Mangrove forests are highly productive coastal ecosystems that significantly influence global carbon cycling. This study characterized the sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the processes affecting their distributions in a mangrove-influenced estuary located in French Guiana (FG), a region representative of these dynamic systems down drift of the Amazon River. Four sampling cruises were carried out between 2013 and 2015 in surface waters of the estuary during dry and wet seasons. Stable isotopes (\xce\xb413DOC, \xce\xb413POC, \xce\xb413DIC), elemental ratios and optical properties (absorption) were used as proxies to identify different C sources. Property\xe2\x80\x93salinity relationships revealed regions of approximately linear mixing (e.g., alkalinity) or net sources or sinks (e.g., DOC). DIC speciation and isotopic distributions demonstrated dynamic source\xe2\x80\x93sink reaction processes within the estuary. DOC was the major form of organic carbon representing mixtures of terrestrial sources (e.g., pore water, litter leaching) and very high concentration (400\xe2\x80\x93800\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) compared to other mangrove settings (e.g. Brazilian, Sundarbans, African). Highly negative \xce\xb413POC (\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x8940\xe2\x80\xb0) in the riverine part presumably suggests the role of freshwater phytoplankton in the dry season and methanotrophic sources derived from senescent mangrove deposits or upstream hydrothermal dam during the wet season. Microphytobenthos and marine phytoplankton were the primary sources of POC inshore and DOC offshore, respectively. Mangrove products and benthic microalgae dominated estuarine sources of C in FG coastal waters (~\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0km, inner shelf region), and there was extensive exchange of C between forest and tidal flat and the estuarine reservoirs.'

Abstract: 'Biosphere II is a new project to build a self-contained ecological system containing humans, plants, and as many other living organisms as necessary for long-term sustenance. Soviet space scientists have already designed \xe2\x80\x9cBios 3,\xe2\x80\x9d simulating conditions on board a flight to Mars. In building Biosphere II, the Institute of Ecotechnics (IE), in collaboration with Space Biospheres Ventures, Decisions Teams Limited, The Environmental Research Laboratory associated with The University of Arizona, and Sarbid Limited, plan to build the prototype of an artificial world in which environmental and ecological processes can be observed closely; An educational, scientific, and ethical \xe2\x80\x9claboratory\xe2\x80\x9d, Biosphere II will raise public consciousness of the interdependence of all life. It will also serve as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d world where possibly harmful environmental effects can be modelled before they reach a crisis stage. Eventually the biospheres are to be marketed and set up in space as the biosphere, no longer in conflict with but aided by human technology, puts forth its young upon other celestial bodies.'

Abstract: 'The changes in forest cover in many parts of the world lead to increase the accumulation of atmospheric carbon and thus accelerate the process of global warming. Optical remote sensing has been used to map and quantify deforestation but its application is limited because of the presence of cloud coverage on the images. Recent availability of several space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions has widened the scope of utilizing radar images for monitoring of forest cover change. The objective of this investigation is to examine the capability of SAR data to assess and map deforestation. The study area is located at the tropical forest region of southeastern Bangladesh. Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) data of 1994 and Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR data of 2007 were used in this study. ALOS PALSAR data were orthorectified with Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model data. Image to image geometric registration was done between the two SAR scenes. Study area was clipped and separated as subsets. SIR-C data (L- and C-bands) was in dual polarization (HH and HV) and PALSAR (L-band) was in quad-polarization (HH, HV, VH, and VV). Five different categories of land covers (forest, upland soil/shrubs, lowland soil, settlements, and water/wetlands) were recognized on both SAR scenes. An additional class representing forest re-growth could be identified only on SIR-C image. Both the images were classified using maximum likelihood algorithms. The classification accuracy was computed from the randomly selected independent validation pixels. The accuracy for forest is more than 83% except users accuracy computed for PALSAR image. Forest was reduced from 18,000 to 13,800\xc2\xa0ha in the region during the study period. The results of this study will be useful for understanding the applicability of SAR to map and quantify forest cover changes in the tropics.'

Abstract: 'Independent short-term effects of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 50\xe2\x80\x93400 \xc2\xb5mol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921, external CO2 concentration (C a) of 85\xe2\x80\x93850 cm3 m\xe2\x88\x923, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of 0.9\xe2\x80\x932.2 kPa on net photosynthetic rate (P N), stomatal conductance (g s), leaf internal CO2 concentration (C i), and transpiration rates (E) were investigated in three cacao genotypes. In all these genotypes, increasing PPFD from 50 to 400 \xc2\xb5mol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 increased P N by about 50 %, but further increases in PPFD up to 1 500 \xc2\xb5mol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 had no effect on P N. Increasing C a significantly increased P N and C i while g s and E decreased more strongly than in most trees that have been studied. In all genotypes, increasing VPD reduced P N, but the slight decrease in g s and the slight increase in C i with increasing VPD were non-significant. Increasing VPD significantly increased E and this may have caused the reduction in P N. The unusually small response of g s to VPD could limit the ability of cacao to grow where VPD is high. There were no significant differences in gas exchange characteristics (g s, C i, E) among the three cacao genotypes under any measurement conditions.'

Abstract: 'Ayahuasca is a psychotropic plant tea from South America used for religious purposes by indigenous people of the Amazon. Increasing evidence indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of mental health disorders and can enhance mindfulness-related capacities. Most research so far has focused on acute and sub-acute effects of ayahuasca on mental health-related parameters and less on long-term effects.'

Abstract: 'Polybia sericea (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) prey foraging was studied by following individual foragers as they hunted in the field, by observing how wasps handled prey once they had captured it, and by observing wasps as they returned to the nest with prey. Wasps were most likely to forage for prey between 0700 and 1300 hours and between 1600 and 1700 hours. The prey foraging sequence consisted of the behaviours high flight, search, touch, land, groom, walk, bite and malaxate. Captured small prey were malaxated and carried to the nest. Wasps removed the gut from large prey and dragged the meat up a twig or grass stem. A load of the meat was then bitten off and malaxated; the remainder was cached while the wasp made an orientation flight and returned to the nest. The forager returned within minutes for the remainder of the prey. Experiments demonstrated that caching the prey remains above the ground rather than close to the ground, where the prey are generally captured, reduces the chance that the prey will be found and expropriated by ants.'

Abstract: 'Trypanoxyuris croizati n. sp., a parasite ofCallicebus torquatus from Venezuela, is described. The following characters differentiate the new species from the nearest species,Trypanoxyuris callicebi Hugot & Vaucher, 1985 fromCallicebus moloch in Paraguay: inT. callicebi, (i) the hexagonal feature of the cephalic outline is less marked; (ii) crests forming the lateral alae are more developed; (iii) the body is less than half as wide; (iv) the oesophagus is much shorter and the oesophageal bulb less voluminous; (v) the excretory pore and the vulva are closer to the anterior extremity; (vi) the tail is much longer; and (vii) the eggs are more voluminous and their major axis is more elongate.T. callicebi andT. croizati n. sp. are considered to be vicariant forms, stemming from the same species when two populations and their respective hosts were isolated by a geographical barrier, the Amazon. The distribution of these two parasites, which closely matches the zoogeography of hosts, reinforces the hypothesis of Cameron (1929) who postulated a strict co-evolution of primates and their oxyurid parasites.'

Abstract: 'Brazil is an extensive country with five administrative regions that have different climates, mainly due to their geographic locations. The El Ni\xc3\xb1o-Southern Oscillation influences the regime of temperature and precipitation of the Brazilian regions, which can directly affect the thermal discomfort of the population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the human thermal discomfort index (HDI) in the five regions of Brazil for El Ni\xc3\xb1o, La Ni\xc3\xb1a, and neutral years from 1979 to 2017, as well as the influence of the degree of intensity of the Pacific Ocean anomaly in the thermal conditions of the Brazilian regions. Monthly data on air temperature and dewpoint temperature obtained from the ERA-Interim reanalysis were used. The HDI was calculated using specific equations. The results were analyzed by means of composition fields. From the results, it was possible to conclude that the El Ni\xc3\xb1o and La Ni\xc3\xb1a phenomena influence the HDI of the Brazilian regions. El Ni\xc3\xb1o increases the discomfort due to the heat and the La Ni\xc3\xb1a causes them to decrease. This study is important since these phenomena, by influencing thermal conditions, directly affect the well-being and health of the Brazilian population.'

Abstract: 'Across the Americas, biofuels production systems are diverse due to geographic conditions, historical patterns of land tenure, different land use patterns, government policy frameworks, and relations between the national state and civil society, all of which shape the role that biofuels play in individual nations. Although many national governments throughout the Americas continue to incentivize growth of the biofuels industry, one key challenge for biofuels sustainability has been concern about its social impacts. In this article, we discuss some of the key social issues and tensions related to the recent expansion of biofuels production in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. We argue that a process of \xe2\x80\x9csimplification\xe2\x80\x9d of ecological and cultural diversity has aided the expansion of the biofuels frontier in these countries, but is also undermining their viability. We consider the ability of governments and non-state actors in multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI) to address social and environmental concerns that affect rural livelihoods as a result of biofuels expansion. We analyze the tensions between global sustainability standards, national level policies for biofuels development, and local level impacts and visions of sustainability. We find that both government and MSI efforts to address sustainability concerns have limited impact, and recommend greater incorporation of local needs and expertise to improve governance.'

Abstract: 'This article scrutinizes Giovanni Lattanzi\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 monograph about kambo and iboga, two \xe2\x80\x9centheogens,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., substances traditionally believed to bring about, if consumed in an appropriate setting, experiences of the divine as well as beneficial effects on a spiritual and bodily level. Lattanzi draws upon indigenous practices and beliefs, but he pioneers the two substances\xe2\x80\x99 simultaneous application in shamanic ceremonies. A major role in Lattanzi\xe2\x80\x99s narrative is played by \xe2\x80\x9cToltec\xe2\x80\x9d doctrines that he reinvents by drawing upon controversial sources like Carlos Castaneda\xe2\x80\x99s books and by constantly linking Toltec doctrines and achievements with modern and \xe2\x80\x9cscientific\xe2\x80\x9d ones. After a deconstruction of Lattanzi\xe2\x80\x99s Toltec narrative the paper shows, through textual analysis, that his discourse well exemplifies what the scholar Andrew Dawson, in his analysis of Santo Daime (another contemporary, entheogen-based religious movement originating in Latin America), defines as \xe2\x80\x9cdislocution.\xe2\x80\x9d It is argued that dislocution (i.e., a simultaneous attitude of verbal rejection and practical acceptance towards modernity or one of its elements) is interesting ethnographically, but it does not constructively contribute to the understanding, on behalf of scholars and laypeople alike, of entheogens and their effects, nor to the more general debate over religion and science.'

Abstract: 'The IAP Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (IAP-DGVM) has been developed to simulate the distribution and structure of global vegetation within the framework of Earth System Models. It incorporates our group\xe2\x80\x99s recent developments of major model components such as the shrub sub-model, establishment and competition parameterization schemes, and a process-based fire parameterization of intermediate complexity. The model has 12 plant functional types, including seven tree, two shrub, and three grass types, plus bare soil. Different PFTs are allowed to coexist within a grid cell, and their state variables are updated by various governing equations describing vegetation processes from fine-scale biogeophysics and biogeochemistry, to individual and population dynamics, to large-scale biogeography. Environmental disturbance due to fire not only affects regional vegetation competition, but also influences atmospheric chemistry and aerosol emissions. Simulations under observed atmospheric conditions showed that the model can correctly reproduce the global distribution of trees, shrubs, grasses, and bare soil. The simulated global dominant vegetation types reproduce the transition from forest to grassland (savanna) in the tropical region, and from forest to shrubland in the boreal region, but overestimate the region of temperate forest.'

Abstract: 'Leaf breakdown in streams is affected by several factors, such as leaf characteristics, water chemistry, microbial activity, and abundance of shredders. In turn, shredders may be resource-controlled. We hypothesized that the size of litter patches affects leaf breakdown, because large patches should be stable over time and therefore harbor high densities of shredders. We selected litter patches (area 0.25\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0m2) in 10 pools of three first-order streams (Manaus, Brazil). We installed 10 leaf packs of Mabea speciosa (Euphorbiaceae) in each patch, and sampled one after 1\xc2\xa0day and three after 5, 19, and 28\xc2\xa0days. The leaf packs were quickly colonized by the shredding caddisflies Triplectides and Phylloicus. The leaf breakdown rate (mean k\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.026\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.0015 SE) was high and similar to values reported for other tropical and temperate streams, although much higher than values reported for the adjacent Cerrado biome. Assemblage composition varied over time, but was not related to the size of litter patches. Contrary to our hypothesis, litter patch area did not affect breakdown rates (r 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.012, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.766) or abundance of shredders after 5, 19, and 28\xc2\xa0days (r 2\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.243, P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.147). We found, however, a positive relationship between the abundance of tropical shredders and leaf breakdown after 19\xc2\xa0days (r 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.572, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.011), suggesting that shredders play an important role in leaf breakdown in these headwater streams. Our study indicates that leaf breakdown rates in tropical streams are variable and can be as high as those of temperate streams.'

Abstract: 'Bolivia is located at the crossroad of the major climatic influences of Northern and Southern-South America, which turns this country into a natural laboratory to investigate the interactions between ocean-climate and fire variability. We chose two oceanic indices: MEI (multivariate ENSO Index) and AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) to select the three most representative years for four oceanic conditions: El Ni\xc3\xb1o, La Ni\xc3\xb1a, AMO, and standard years (understood as years with little ocean influences), for the period 1992\xe2\x80\x932012. We investigated how i) rainfall (dry vs wet seasons) and ii) fire responded in five Bolivian biomes (Tropical Moist Forests, Tropical Dry Forests, Tropical Grasslands, Tropical Montane, and Seasonally Flooded ecosystems) under these oceanic conditions. Bolivia showed a strong rainfall increase in El Ni\xc3\xb1o years in both seasons (wet/dry), while AMO showed the strongest droughts in both seasons. La Ni\xc3\xb1a showed a bipolar response with rainfall increases in the wet season and a very marked rainfall decrease in the dry season. Drought significantly increased fire numbers in AMO years, being the most significant fire condition and suggesting a larger fire influence of the Atlantic than the Pacific at the national level. Surprisingly, the amount of fire was very large under normal years (STD) and similar to fire levels under La Ni\xc3\xb1a, suggesting generalized fire conditions in the country, except for El Ni\xc3\xb1o years that bring rainfall excess and little fire. The most fire-affected biomes were the seasonally flooded and dry forests, followed by the grassland/savannah biome. Montane areas showed the least fire, but satellite fire omission is well known in the Andean region.'

Abstract: 'Conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land uses is known to alter soil nitrogen (N) transformation processes and microbial biomass carbon (MB-C ), which affect productivity and stability of the derived land uses. Information about how conversion of moist evergreen forest to agricultural land uses affects soil nitrogen (N) transformation processes and MB-C in hot humid tropics is meager. The present study explores the following questions: (1) how does conversion of native moist evergreen forest to agricultural production systems (grassland, home garden and silvopasture) affect net soil N mineralization rates, pools of mineral nitrogen (NH 4 + - N and NO 3 - - N) and MB-C in the hot humid tropical climate of South Andaman, India and (2) are changes in soil N transformations and MB-C related to differences in soil moisture and temperature induced with forest conversion? Variations in net soil N mineralization, NH 4 + - N and NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 - N pools, MB-C and soil temperature and moisture were measured across wet, post-wet and dry seasons at ten sites of each derived agricultural land use and native forest. In addition, inputs of carbon (C ) and N to the soils and outputs of C and N from the land use systems through harvests were also measured. We measured the N mineralization rate by the buried bag technique using 2\xc2\xa0M KCl as an extractant. The NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 - N and NH 4 + - N were measured at the beginning and end of incubation. The MB-C was measured by a chloroform fumigation-extraction method. We found that forest conversion resulted in a decline in carbon input, but caused rise in soil temperature (from 0.4 to 9.8% across the seasons) in derived agricultural land uses compared to native forest. The soil temperature increase was the highest in the grassland and lowest in the home garden. Across the three seasons, net soil N mineralization rates increased 27 to 55 % in the derived agricultural land uses compared to the native forest, with the increase highest in the grassland and lowest in the home garden. Soil organic C (SOC), MB-C, and NO 3 -  declined in the derived agricultural land uses relative to native forest, with the greatest effect again seen in the grassland. These observations suggest that native forest conversion to agricultural uses results in lower soil organic C content over time, due to increased mineralization rates stimulated by a rise in soil temperature, and that these soil changes may be most pronounced in grasslands. Therefore, tree based land uses offer good options for soil carbon build up and protection against N loss in the hot humid tropics.'

Abstract: 'Here we present 36 new records of 22 species of Lentibulariaceae from northeastern Brazil, expanding their distribution range and providing taxonomic, habitat and phenological comments, in addition to distribution maps and photographs of living specimens. Rio Grande do Norte is the state with the highest number of new records (12), followed by Alagoas, with eight. This is the first insight on the actual richness of the family in the region, and some species show interesting disjunct distributions and habitat restrictions. Only one species treated here is endemic to northeastern Brazil, ten species seem to be restricted to lowland white-sand wetlands, and three are restricted to high altitudes in campos rupestres or in campos de altitude. The remaining ones have a wider distribution. Our data support previous hypotheses on plant dispersal and past connections between Brazilian vegetation formations, shedding light for future studies on the dispersal history and biogeography of Lentibulariaceae.'

Abstract: ' Renewed research interest in the origins of pottery has illuminated an array of possible precipitating causes and environmental contexts in which pottery began to be made and used. This article is an attempt at synthesizing some of these data in hopes of stimulating further research into this intriguing topic. Following a review of theories on the origins of pottery, discussion proceeds to a survey of geographic and cultural contexts of low-fired or unfired pottery, highlighting the role(s) of pottery among contemporary hunter-gatherers and summarizing data pertaining to varied uses of pottery containers. It is argued that objects of unfired and low-fired clay were created as part of early \xe2\x80\x9cprestige technologies\xe2\x80\x9d of material representations beginning in the Upper Paleolithic and are part of an early \xe2\x80\x9csoftware horizon.\xe2\x80\x9d Clay began to be more widely manipulated by nonsedentary, complex hunter-gatherers in the very Late Pleistocene and early Holocene in areas of resource abundance, especially in tropical/subtropical coastal/riverine zones, as part of more general processes of resource and social intensification (such as \xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive feasting\xe2\x80\x9d or communal ritual). Knowledge of making and using pottery containers spread widely as \xe2\x80\x9cprestige technology\xe2\x80\x9d and as \xe2\x80\x9cpractical technology,\xe2\x80\x9d the kind and timing of its adoption or \xe2\x80\x9creinvention\xe2\x80\x9d varying from location to location depending on specific needs and circumstances.

Abstract: 'Stones were used to sample macroinvertebrates and characterise microhabitats at monthly or bimonthly intervals in six Ecuadorian streams covering a gradient in four different stability measures and other stream characteristics. The physical variables current velocity, water depth, horizontal position, embeddedness and size were measured to characterise stone microhabitats and presumed to be affected by or related to physical impact during hydrological disturbances. My first objective was to analyse how density, the number of families and a richness measure (residuals from a power regression of families vs. individuals) were related to the physical characteristics of individual stone habitats. My second objective was to quantify temporal variability in fauna\xe2\x80\x93stone relationships and to analyse if such variability was related to overall stability of stream reaches. Partial Least Squares (PLS) multiple regression analyses showed high temporal variability between sampling dates in factor loadings of specific stone micro habitat variables. In spite of this, there was a clear negative effect of depth and a positive effect of current on density and number of families. Stone size was consistently negatively related to density and positively related to number of families. Patterns were less clear for richness residuals. Simple linear regressions of fauna vs. stone parameters generally confirmed the results reached by the PLS analysis, although few of the regressions were significant. For all fauna\xe2\x80\x93stone regressions the variability in slopes was much higher among sampling dates within streams (temporal variability) than among streams (spatial variability), and significant slopes were even inverted on different sampling dates. Although the coefficients of variation (CV) of slopes of a given combination of fauna parameter and stone variable from different sampling dates (n=9\xe2\x80\x9311) were rarely correlated to any of the measures of stream stability, this study has demonstrated high temporal variability in fauna\xe2\x80\x93stone relationships (CV\xe2\x80\x99s of regression slopes). Consequently, temporally un-replicated studies of such relationships do not necessarily reveal general patterns.'

Abstract: 'The benign character formerly attributed to Plasmodium vivax infection has been dismantled by the increasing number of reports of severe disease associated with infection with this parasite, prompting the need for more thorough and comprehensive characterization of the spectrum of resulting clinical complications. Endemic areas exhibit wide variations regarding severe disease frequency. This study, conducted simultaneously in Brazil and India, constitutes, to our knowledge, the first multisite study focused on clinical characterization of P. vivax severe disease.'

Abstract: 'Since the launch of the first satellite in 1972, ecologists have been equipped with new tools to address the degradation of tropical forests, previously limited by field-based methods. This article is a review of the state of remote sensing technology in characterizing the degradation of tropical forest. The factors responsible for the structural and functional degradation of the tropical forest and its likely impacts are described in view of generating remote sensing based inputs. In order to assess the degradation and utility of geo-informatics tools, 32 parameters are identified. The research developments at different levels of information extraction from the historic to recent periods are elaborated, and future challenges are predicted. The article concludes that an additional momentum of research is required to answer many unresolved questions of tropical forest degradation.'

Abstract: 'Fire activity has varied globally and continuously since the last glacial maximum (LGM) in response to long-term changes in global climate and shorter-term regional changes in climate, vegetation, and human land use. We have synthesized sedimentary charcoal records of biomass burning since the LGM and present global maps showing changes in fire activity for time slices during the past 21,000\xc2\xa0years (as differences in charcoal accumulation values compared to pre-industrial). There is strong broad-scale coherence in fire activity after the LGM, but spatial heterogeneity in the signals increases thereafter. In North America, Europe and southern South America, charcoal records indicate less-than-present fire activity during the deglacial period, from 21,000 to \xe2\x88\xbc11,000 cal yr BP. In contrast, the tropical latitudes of South America and Africa show greater-than-present fire activity from \xe2\x88\xbc19,000 to \xe2\x88\xbc17,000 cal yr BP and most sites from Indochina and Australia show greater-than-present fire activity from 16,000 to \xe2\x88\xbc13,000 cal yr BP. Many sites indicate greater-than-present or near-present activity during the Holocene with the exception of eastern North America and eastern Asia from 8,000 to \xe2\x88\xbc3,000 cal yr BP, Indonesia and Australia from 11,000 to 4,000 cal yr BP, and southern South America from 6,000 to 3,000 cal yr BP where fire activity was less than present. Regional coherence in the patterns of change in fire activity was evident throughout the post-glacial period. These complex patterns can largely be explained in terms of large-scale climate controls modulated by local changes in vegetation and fuel load.'

Abstract: 'A survey was conducted of Caicara farmers from Ubatuba in the Brazilian coastland between S\xc3\xa3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro States regarding the folk-taxonomy for cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) landraces they cultivate and cassava evolutionary dynamics in swidden cultivation. The accuracy of their folk taxonomy was assessed. Cluster analysis was used to make comparisons between names given by the farmers to sampled individuals and their isozyme phenotypes obtained with four isozyme systems. Interviews with farmers were done and ethnobiological data collected. These farmers possess a loose taxonomic system and tend to underestimate cassava genetic diversity in their gardens. However, classification skills vary considerably among them. The accuracy of their taxonomy along with the results of interviews with farmers and ethnobiological data are discussed in light of a proposed evolutionary dynamics model for cultivated cassava and its ecology in tropical swidden cultivation.'

Abstract: 'Episodic multi-year droughts fundamentally alter the dynamics, functioning, and structure of Amazonian forests. However, the capacity of individual plant species to withstand intense drought regimes remains unclear. Here, we evaluated ecophysiological responses from a forest community where we sampled 83 woody plant species during 5\xc2\xa0years of experimental drought (throughfall exclusion) in an eastern Amazonian terra firme forest. Overall, the experimental drought resulted in shifts of some, but not all, leaf traits related to photosynthetic carbon uptake and intrinsic water-use efficiency. Leaf \xce\xb413C values increased by 2\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\xb0 within the canopy, consistent with increased diffusional constraints on photosynthesis. Decreased leaf C:N ratios were also observed, consistent with lower investments in leaf structure. However, no statistically significant treatment effects on leaf nitrogen content were observed, consistent with a lack of acclimation in photosynthetic capacity or increased production of nitrogen-based secondary metabolites. The results of our study provide evidence of robust acclimation potential to drought intensification in the diverse flora of an Amazonian forest community. The results reveals considerable ability of several species to respond to intense drought and challenge commonly held perspectives that this flora has attained limited adaptive plasticity because of a long evolutionary history in a favorable and stable climate.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity, population structure, abundance and dispersion patterns of all woody plants \xe2\x89\xa510cm gbh were inventoried in two 1-ha plots of tropical dry evergreen (sacred grove or temple) forests at Kuzhanthaikuppam (KK) and Thirumanikkuzhi (TM) on the Coromandel coast of south India. Site KK is a stunted forest (average tree height ca 6 m) and TM a tall forest (average tree height ca 10 m). A total of 54 species (in 47 genera and 31 families) were recorded. Species richness and stand density were 42 and 38 species and 1367 and 974 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 respectively for the sites KK and TM. About 50% of the total species were common to both the sites. Site TM is twofold more voluminous (basal area 29.48 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921) than KK (basal area 15.44 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921). Nearly one third of the individuals are multi-stemmed in the low-statured site KK whereas one fourth of the tree density is multi-stemmed in TM. Species abundance pattern varied between the two sites. The abundance of three species in KK and two species in TM is pronounced. Memecylon umbellatum, the most abundant species contributing to one third of total stand density in KK, is least represented in TM. Species richness, density and diversity indices decreased with increasing girth threshold. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 and 1-ha scales. Population structure for girth frequency is an expanding one for both the sites, except for basal area distribution in KK. Variations in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts. In the light of habitat uniqueness, species richness and sacred grove status, the need for conservation is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'Lianas, or woody climbing plants, are a major constituent of seasonally dry tropical forests, and are thought to impact negatively their host trees. In this study we evaluated whether liana presence was associated with reduced leaf water potentials and growth in adult Senna multijuga trees during the dry season in a lowland Bolivian forest. We used leaf water potentials in trees as a first approach to assess trees\xe2\x80\x99 water status, under the assumption that leaf water potentials become more negative when water losses (via transpiration) exceed gains (by uptake). We measured relative growth in girth at 1.5 m height (gbh) to quantify tree growth. At the beginning of the 1996 dry season (early June), we selected 20 S. multijuga trees 10\xe2\x80\x9320 cm dbh, and measured their gbh. We also recorded pre-dawn and mid-day leaf water potentials in these trees. In ten experimental trees all lianas were then cut, while the remaining trees were used as controls. Pre-dawn and mid-day water potentials were re-measured 1 day after liana-cutting, and then every week in all trees for 1 month and then at 3 and 5 months, until the beginning of the next rainy season (November); gbh was measured again in July 1997 to estimate relative growth rate. Liana removal was associated with less negative pre-dawn (\xe2\x80\x930.3 vs \xe2\x80\x930.4 MPa) and mid-day (\xe2\x80\x930.5 vs \xe2\x80\x930.7 MPa) water potentials in trees during the dry season. This difference appeared as early as 1 day after cutting, and disappeared once the rainy season began. Liana-cut trees grew more (0.4 mm/mm year) than liana-uncut trees (0.2 mm/mm year). These findings suggest that lianas may interfere with water availability to these trees during the dry season, and may also hinder tree growth.'

Abstract: 'Landscape dynamics result from forestry and farming practices, both of which are expected to have diverse impacts on ecosystem services (ES). In this study, we investigated this general statement for regulating and supporting services via an assessment of ecosystem functions: climate regulation via carbon sequestration in soil and plant biomass, water cycle and soil erosion regulation via water infiltration in soil, and support for primary production via soil chemical quality and water storage. We tested the hypothesis that patterns of land-cover composition and structure significantly alter ES metrics at two different scales. We surveyed 54 farms in two Amazonian regions of Brazil and Colombia and assessed land-cover composition and structure from remote sensing data (farm scale) from 1990 to 2007. Simple and well-established methods were used to characterize soil and vegetation from five points in each farm (plot scale). Most ES metrics were significantly correlated with land-use (plot scale) and land-cover (farm scale) classifications; however, spatial variability in inherent soil properties, alone or in interaction with land-use or land-cover changes, contributed greatly to variability in ES metrics. Carbon stock in above-ground plant biomass and water infiltration rate decreased from forest to pasture land covers, whereas soil chemical quality and plant-available water storage capacity increased. Land-cover classifications based on structure metrics explained significantly less ES metric variation than those based on composition metrics. Land-cover composition dynamics explained 45\xc2\xa0% (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) of ES metric variance, 15\xc2\xa0% by itself and 30\xc2\xa0% in interaction with inherent soil properties. This study describes how ES evolve with landscape changes, specifying the contribution of spatial variability in the physical environment and highlighting trade-offs and synergies among ES.'

Abstract: ' Tropical soils account for 10%\xe2\x80\x9320% of the 15\xe2\x80\x9335 Tg of atmospheric methane (CH4) consumed annually by soils, although tropical deforestation could be changing the soil sink. The objectives of this study were (a) to quantify differences in soil CH4 fluxes among primary forest, secondary forest, active pasture, and degraded pasture in eastern Amazonia; and (b) to investigate controlling mechanisms of CH4 fluxes, including N availability, gas-phase transport, and soil respiration. At one ranch, Fazenda Vit\xc3\xb3ria, annual uptake estimates (kg CH4ha\xe2\x88\x921 y\xe2\x88\x921) based on monthly measurements were: primary forest, 2.1; secondary forest, 1.0; active pasture, 1.3; degraded pasture, 3.1. The lower annual uptake in the active pasture compared with the primary forest was due to CH4 production during the wet season in the pasture soils, which is consistent with findings from other studies. In contrast, the degraded pasture was never a CH4 source. Expressing uptake as a negative flux and emission as a positive flux, CH4 fluxes were positively correlated with CO2 fluxes, indicating that root and microbial respiration in the productive pastures, and to a lesser extent in the primary forest, contributed to the formation of anaerobic microsites where CH4 was produced, whereas this productivity was absent in the degraded pasture. In all land uses, uptake rates of atmospheric CH4 were greater in the dry season than in the wet season, indicating the importance of soil water content and gas transport on CH4 fluxes. These clay soils had low annual uptake rates relative to reported rates on sandy soils, which also is consistent with gas transport within the soil being a limiting factor. Nitrogen availability indices did not correlate with CH4 fluxes, indicating that inhibition of CH4 oxidation was not an important mechanism explaining differences among land uses. At another ranch, Fazenda Agua Parada, no significant effect of pasture age was observed along a chronosequence of pasture ages. We conclude that land-use change can either increase or decrease the soil sink of CH4, depending on the duration of wet and dry seasons, the effects of seasonal precipitation on gas-phase transport, and the phenology and relative productivity of the vegetation in each land use.'

Abstract: 'Indigenous reserves are increasingly common throughout the tropical world. This is particularly true in Amazonia, where they make up >50% of protected land area. While these reserves offer tremendous opportunities for conservation, hunting represents a considerable threat to primate populations. As eliminating hunting may not be feasible, conservationists must work collaboratively with indigenous groups to promote sustainable management. This requires an understanding of the sociocultural drivers of hunting, quantitatively assessing sustainability, and developing co-management strategies that are commensurable with indigenous ontologies. In this article, we integrate ethnography with sustainability modeling to assess the importance of primate hunting to the livelihoods and culture of indigenous Waiwai in the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area, Guyana and to simultaneously promote sustainable co-management. We collected quantitative data on Waiwai harvesting through hunter self-monitoring and used semistructured interviews, unstructured interviews, and participant observation to understand the cultural importance of hunting to Waiwai society. We incorporated these data into spatially explicit biodemographic models to assess sustainability for four primate species. Primates, particularly spider monkeys (Ateles pansicus), were among the most important Waiwai prey and primate hunting played an important role in the construction of both individual and collective Waiwai identity. Our biodemographic models indicated that hunting will cause relatively little depletion for most primates in 20\xc2\xa0years, although spider monkeys are predicted to disappear from a majority of the Waiwai catchment area. We argue that successful co-management of hunting in indigenous reserves requires truly integrative approaches that combine quantitative sustainability assessments with detailed concurrent ethnographic research.'

Abstract: 'Canopy structure, defined by leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FCover) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), regulates a wide range of forest functions and ecosystem services. Spatially consistent field-measurements of canopy structure are however lacking, particularly for the tropics.'

Abstract: 'The concept of neutrality, which presents a new view of the problem associated with the coexistence of species competing for shared resources, has recently stimulated renewed interest in the structure of communities. Unlike the traditional concept, which states that species must occupy different ecological niches, the concept of neutrality assumes that species can successfully coexist due to their ecological similarity and close rates of their specific (per individual) reproduction, extinction, and colonization of free space. An analysis of the vast literature on the new concept allowed us to formulate the following questions: (1) What do we actually mean when we speak about the coexistence of species? (2) How can we explain the presence of numerous rare species in a community against a background of a small number of abundant species? (3) Do rare species have any advantages compared to abundant species? (4) Can the mechanisms implied by the concept of neutrality and the traditional niche approach work simultaneously in the same community? When trying to answer these questions, we should do the following: (1) reject the demand for the infinitely long coexistence of species, which is considered obligatory in all models; (2) accept that the ratio of relative abundances of species observed in communities (a large number of rare species against a background of a few abundant species) results not only from ecological processes (dispersal, competition, etc.), but also from evolutionary mechanisms (formation of the initial pool of species); (3) admit that rare species have certain advantages for survival compared to abundant species; (4) accept that species in any multispecies community can coexist either by occupying different ecological niches or by approaching ecological similarity. Despite the advances made in understanding the general principles in community organization, the question posed by Hutchinson 50 years ago of why there are so many kinds of animals has yet to be answered.'

Abstract: 'Environmental gradients play a key role in shaping diversity in tropical forests. However, we have a little understanding of how evolutionary diversity is affected by gradients and the role of niche persistence in flooded forests in dry biomes. Here, we assessed the evolutionary diversity across a flooding gradient in the Caatinga Domain of South America. We established 120 plots across four tributaries of the S\xc3\xa3o Francisco River, eastern Brazil, consisting of 72 plots in flooded, 24 in occasionally flooded, and 24 in unflooded forests. We computed richness, phylogenetic diversity (PD), mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD), and mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (MPD) and their standardized effect sizes (ses.PD, ses.MNTD, and ses.MPD). We found low richness, low PD, and high MNTD values in flooded forests relative to unflooded and occasionally flooded forests. MPD did not differ across the flooding gradient. The standardized effect size metrics were higher in flooded forests. Despite the unflooded and occasionally flooded forests being rich in terms of species and correlated phylogenetic structure, flooded forests showed more lineage diversity than expected by chance. We assessed whether this pattern could be driven by resprouting ability testing its phylogenetic signal. Resprouting is randomly distributed across phylogeny, but plant communities are likely assembled from random draws of the resprouters\xe2\x80\x99 lineage pool. Quantifying evolutionary diversity across flooding gradients in dry environments brought new insights to how the same environmental filters may lead to disparate patterns of evolutionary diversity and the role of response traits in allowing certain clades to persist in flooded habitats.'

Abstract: 'Quantifying diversity is an old challenge for ecologists and is also a social demand given the increasing threats to natural areas. We sought to work on these issues by using data from 158 vegetation remnants (over 350,000 trees) in southeastern Brazil (Minas Gerais State\xe2\x80\x94MG, nearly 600,000\xc2\xa0km2). Specifically, we sought to answer the following questions. (1) How many trees and tree species currently exist in MG vegetation remnants? (2) How much of such biodiversity is present in each vegetation domain (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado and Caatinga) and vegetation type (Seasonally Dry tropical forest \xe2\x80\x9csemideciduous\xe2\x80\x9d, Seasonally Dry tropical forest \xe2\x80\x9cdeciduous\xe2\x80\x9d, Rain Forest, Swamp, Cerrado and Cerrad\xc3\xa3o) in MG? (3) How much has been lost in regards to tree amount and tree species? We built a 0.1-degree cell grid to estimate the number of trees via spatial regression and used Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s alpha and Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s log series to provide estimates on how many tree species there are and were in MG. We found the number of trees in Minas Gerais to be approximately 24.5\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0109, and the number of tree species to be between 3592 and 3743. The most abundant species distribution among the vegetation domains and vegetation types followed inversely the environmental heterogeneity of the classes. Consequently, the most abundant species in MG belonged to the Cerrado domain, where there was less environmental heterogeneity. The numbers of trees and tree species lost were estimated at 68.54 and 4.03\xe2\x80\x938.42% of the original values, respectively. We discuss that due to the consequences of human impacts that go back in the region for over a thousand years, other processes not considered in this study, such as habitat degradation by isolation, alterations of food webs, unsustainable use, and climate change, might have caused local extinctions and potentially increased the number of species lost. We believe our results may guide conservation initiatives by providing a base for future environmental laws, parks planning, and the development of more appropriate vegetation management techniques in MG. In addition, our results may inspire future quantitative ecological studies in the tropics.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the status and characteristics of agrobiodiversity present in Kerala State, India, which is a part of the Western Ghats\xe2\x80\x94Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot. They show much heterogeneity. The State grows 142 crop plants belonging to 104 genera and 43 families. Almost the entire agrobiodiversity conservation work is being carried out by the central government, even though the states are also mandated to do this work. This appears to have an adverse effect on agrobiodiversity conservation. Until now, most attention was being paid to only the most important food and commercial crops, and very limited to their wild relatives and the less important crop plants.'

Abstract: ' Although most insects are vulnerable to predation by a variety of predators, including birds, there are few direct observational studies in the wild of avian predation on adult butterflies. We examined the predatory behavior of smooth-billed anis (Crotophaga ani) on butterflies, and the spacing behavior of the butterflies which were concentrated on a mineral-rich beach on the Cristalino River, in Mato Grosso, Brazil. We studied eight of the most regularly occurring butterfly species which came each morning to engage in "puddling." Most species of butterfly were closely associated with conspecifics, although nearest-neighbor distance varied among species. The pierids \xe2\x80\x93 "yellows" (Aphrissa statira, Phoebis trite), "oranges" (Phoebis argante), and sometimes "whites" (Daptoneura leucadia) \xe2\x80\x93 formed very dense groups (or clusters) of up to 1,000 individuals occasionally joined by a few kite swallowtails (Eurytides spp.). Most other butterfly species formed small groups (e.g., daggerwings, Marpesia spp.) or were dispersed individually and non-clumped over the beach (e.g., dingy purplewing, Eunica monima). Anis foraged using two strategies: rapid frontal attack on dense groups of butterflies (yellows, oranges, whites), and a stealthy approach to solitary butterflies (mainly purplewings) or those in small groups. For yellows, the most common butterfly caught by anis, the capture rate reached over 6 per 15\xc2\xa0min per ani, and about 8% of those captured managed to escape. Capture rates were much lower for the other species. Time of day, age of the ani (adult or young-of-the-year), and total number of each butterfly species present accounted for variation in the number of each species captured by anis. The number of butterflies captured per 15\xc2\xa0min increased as the number of butterflies present increased, but reached a threshold beyond which the capture rate did not increase. The capture rate per individual butterfly (individual risk) decreased with group size up to a group of 40 individuals and remained low with further increases. Thus a butterfly in a group of 100 was no less likely to be eaten than one in a group of 40. For individual ani forays into dense groups of pierids, an individual ani was unable to catch more than 16, regardless of group size. These data confirm the dilution effect of group size for butterflies; each individual yellow or orange was less at risk from ani predation when in a group.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Microbiome Project (BMP) aims to assemble a Brazilian Metagenomic Consortium/Database. At present, many metagenomic projects underway in Brazil are widely known. Our goal in this initiative is to co-ordinate and standardize these together with new projects to come. It is estimated that Brazil hosts approximately 20 % of the entire world\xe2\x80\x99s macroorganism biological diversity. It is 1 of the 17 countries that share nearly 70 % of the world\xe2\x80\x99s catalogued animal and plant species, and is recognized as one of the most megadiverse countries. At the end of 2012, Brazil has joined GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), as associated member, to improve the access to the Brazilian biodiversity data in a free and open way. This was an important step toward increasing international collaboration and clearly shows the commitment of the Brazilian government in directing national policies toward sustainable development. Despite its importance, the Brazilian microbial diversity is still considered to be largely unknown, and it is clear that to maintain ecosystem dynamics and to sustainably manage land use, it is crucial to understand the biological and functional diversity of the system. This is the first attempt to collect and collate information about Brazilian microbial genetic and functional diversity in a systematic and holistic manner. The success of the BMP depends on a massive collaborative effort of both the Brazilian and international scientific communities, and therefore, we invite all colleagues to participate in this project.'

Abstract: ' Concentration and isotopic composition (\xce\xb413C and \xce\xb418O) of ambient CO2 and water vapour were determined within a Quercus petraea canopy, Northumberland, UK. From continuous measurements made across a 36-h period from three heights within the forest canopy, we generated mixing lines (Keeling plots) for \xce\xb4a13CO2, \xce\xb4a C18O16O and \xce\xb4a H218O, to derive the isotopic composition of the signal being released from forest to atmosphere. These were compared directly with measurements of different respective pools within the forest system, i.e. \xce\xb413C of organic matter input for \xce\xb4a13CO2, \xce\xb418O of exchangeable water for \xce\xb4a C18O16O and transpired water vapour for \xce\xb4a H218O. [CO2] and \xce\xb4a13CO2 showed strong coupling, where the released CO2 was, on average, 4 per mil enriched compared to the organic matter of plant material in the system, suggesting either fractionation of organic material before eventual release as soil-respired CO2, or temporal differences in ecosystem discrimination. \xce\xb4a C18O16O was less well coupled to [CO2], probably due to the heterogeneity and transient nature of water pools (soil, leaf and moss) within the forest. Similarly, \xce\xb4a H218O was less coupled to [H2O], again reflecting the transient nature of water transpired to the forest, seen as uncoupling during times of large changes in vapour pressure deficit. The \xce\xb418O of transpired water vapour, inferred from both mixing lines at the canopy scale and direct measurement at the leaf level, approximated that of source water, confirming that an isotopic steady state held for the forest integrated over the daily cycle. This demonstrates that isotopic coupling of CO2 and water vapour within a forest canopy will depend on absolute differences in the isotopic composition of the respective pools involved in exchange and on the stability of each of these pools with time.'

Abstract: 'In Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, the water of lakes and rivers showed high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, 5-50mgC/l. There was a clear relationship between DOC concentration and pH. DOC also contributed to low water transparency in the studied lakes. Water colors measured by spectrophotometer showed a strong relationship with DOC concentration, indicating high applicability of water color measurement for estimation of DOC. The development of a simple but quick estimation of DOC will contribute to understanding the seasonal dynamics of DOC, which might regulate both abiotic and biotic conditions in aquatic ecosystems in this area.'

Abstract: 'Physiognomy, structure and floristic composition of one hectare of lowland tropical rain forest was studied in detail at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Physiognomically, the Los Tuxtlas forest should be classified as \xe2\x80\x98lowland tropical high evergreen rain forest\xe2\x80\x99. The forest showed a closed canopy at 30\xe2\x80\x9335 m. Of all woody, non-climbing species with a DBH\xe2\x89\xa51.0 cm 89.4% (94.5% of all individuals) were evergreen, 25.4% (59.5% of the individuals) had compound leaves, and over 80% of species (and individuals) had leaves in the notophyll and mesophyll size classes. The forest structure was characterized by a low density (2976 individuals with a DBH\xe2\x89\xa51.0 cm, 346 individuals with a DBH\xe2\x89\xa510.0 cm, per ha, excluding vines) with an average basal area (38.1 m2, DBH\xe2\x89\xa51.0 cm, 34.9 m2, DBH\xe2\x89\xa510.0 cm, per ha, excluding vines). This was attributed to the relative maturity of the forest on the study plot. The study plot contained 234 species (11 208 individuals with a height \xe2\x89\xa50.5 m), of which 55.1% (34.8% of individuals) were trees, 9.4% (6.8%) shrubs, 3.4% (44.3%) palms, 20.1% (5.2%) vines, 6.8% (8.7%) herbs and 5.1% (0.3%) of unknown lifeform. Furthermore, 58 species of epiphytes and hemi-epiphytes were found. Diversity of trees, shrubs and palms with a DBH\xe2\x89\xa51.0 cm was calculated as Shannon-Wiener index (4.65), Equitability index (0.65), and Simpson index (0.10). The dominance-diversity curve showed a lognormal form, characteristic for tropical rain forest. The community structure was characterized by a relative dominance of Astrocaryum mexicanum in the understorey, Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria in the middle storeys, and Nectandra ambigens in the canopy. Species population structures of 31 species showed three characteristic patterns, differentiated by recruitment: continuously high, discontinuously high, and continuously low recruitment. Height/diameter and crown cover/diameter diagrams suggested a very gradual shift from height growth to crown growth during tree development. Forest turnover was calculated as 138 years. Compared to other tropical rain forests the Los Tuxtlas forest had 1. similar leaf physiognomical characteristics, 2. a lower diversity, 3. a lower density, 4. an average basal area, and 5. a slow canopy turnover.'

Abstract: 'Nitrogen budgets of late successional forested stands and watersheds provide baseline data against which the effects of small- and large-scale disturbances may be measured. Using previously published data and supplemental new data on gaseous N loss, we construct a N budget for hillslope tabonuco forest (HTF) stands in Puerto Rico. HTF stands are subject to frequent hurricanes and landslides; here, we focus on N fluxes in the late phase of inter-disturbance forest development. N inputs from atmospheric deposition (4-6 kg N/ha/yr) are exceeded by N outputs from groundwater, gaseous N loss, and particulate N loss (6.3\xe2\x80\x9315.7 kg N/ha/yr). Late-successional HTF stands also sequester N in their aggrading biomass (8 kg N/ha/yr), creating a total budget imbalance of 8.3\xe2\x80\x9319.7 kg N/ha/yr. We surmise that this imbalance may be accounted for by unmeasured inputs from above- and belowground N-fixation and/or slow depletion of the large N pool in soil organic matter. Spatial and temporal variability, especially that associated with gaseous exchange and soil organic matter N-mineralization, constrain the reliability of this N budget.'

Abstract: 'During the past thirty years, natural selection due to predation has been investigated with regard to prey motion in three areas that are relevant to the evolution of mimicry: (1) anti-apostatic selection, (2) locomotor mimicry, and (3) escape mimicry. Anti-apostatic selection, or selection against the odd individuals, arises when prey are at very high densities or when prey are M\xc3\xbcllerian mimics. When prey are at high densities, motion of the prey increases selection against odd individuals. When the prey are M\xc3\xbcllerian mimics, motion may also play an important role in strengthening selection against odd individuals. This may explain locomotor mimicry between M\xc3\xbcllerian mimics. Locomotor mimicry arises when two distantly-related prey species appear alike in behaviour, and there is a corresponding suite of morphological, physiological, and biomechanical traits that the prey have in common. Locomotor mimicry has been demonstrated in M\xc3\xbcllerian mimics. It is also predicted to occur in Batesian mimics but with important limitations due to selection by the predator for the prey to maintain the ability to escape if detected. Locomotor mimicry may also occur between palatable species that are alike as a result of unprofitable prey (or escape) mimicry. Escape mimicry arises when prey are difficult to capture. By frustration learning, the predator associates the colour of the prey with unprofitability. In all three instances, dis-similarity in colour or motion probably increases selection against the odd individual. In addition, the interaction of colour and motion gives rise to greater reliability of the signals to a specialist predator. However for a generalist predator, multiple component signals of the prey lead to errors in signal perception and greater risk of cheating.'

Abstract: 'The number of adult males in a bisexual primate group is thought to be determined mainly by the defensibility of mating access to the females. However, among primates, small groups sometimes contain several adult male. We evaluate the hypothesis that high predation risk may lead to greater male representation in primate groups, independent of the effect of group size. Male primates are known to be more vigilant than females, and may also be better at detecting potential predators. A comparative test was done using arboreal folivores in three continents, howler monkeys in the Neotropics, colobus monkeys in Africa and langurs in South and Southeast Asia. Howlers and colobus are exposed to predation by large monkey-eating eagles, whereas the langurs are not. We conducted regression analyses on group composition data of single populations and on mean group compositions among populations, and found that the arboreal langurs basically live in groups with only a single adult males whereas groups of howler and colobus monkeys of comparable size have multiple adult males (Fig. 3). Thus, the hypothesis was supported. Several alternative hypotheses do not account for this pattern.'

Abstract: 'A survey was conducted in Brazil to collect fungi on ferns. Based on morphology and inferred phylogeny from DNA sequences of two loci, namely the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (LSU), several species belonging to chalara-like genera and lachnoid fungi were recognized. Eighteen fungal isolates, collected from five host species, representing 10 different localities were studied. Three novel genera (Lachnopsis, Scolecolachnum and Zymochalara), and six novel species (Bloxamia cyatheicola, Lachnopsis catarinensis, Lachnopsis dicksoniae, Scolecolachnum pteridii, Zymochalara lygodii and Zymochalara cyatheae) are introduced. Furthermore, two new combinations (Erioscyphella euterpes and Erioscyphella lushanensis) are proposed. Two novel taxa (Lachnopsis catarinensis and Lachnopsis dicksoniae) may be included in the list of potentially endangered fungal species in Brazil, if proven to be restricted to their tree-fern host, Dicksonia sellowiana, which is included in the official list of endangered plant species in Brazil.'

Abstract: 'The North American commercial incense copals are derived from species of Bursera, Protium (Burseraceae), and Hymenaea (Caesal-piniaceae) but are also distinguished by the technique of harvesting as well as by species. Sixty-eight compounds were identified in three commercial incense copals. The essential oil of copal bianco (probably from B. bipinnata) is dominated by 14.52 \xc2\xb1 1.28% \xce\xb1-copaene and 13.75 \xc2\xb1 1.06% germacrene D. The essential oil of copal oro (probably from H. courbaril) is dominated by 21.35 \xc2\xb1 5.96% \xce\xb1-pinene and 26.51 \xc2\xb1 1.22% limonene. The essential oil of copal negro (probably from P. copal) is dominated by 17.95 \xc2\xb1 1.35% \xce\xb1-pinene, 12.51 \xc2\xb1 0.08% sabinene, and 16.88 \xc2\xb1 2.02% limonene.'

Abstract: 'The present and future well-being of the world\xe2\x80\x99s forest dwelling populations depends on their ability to gain livelihood resources from their immediate environment. Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products has been promoted by conservationists and development agencies as a feasible strategy for forest dwellers that does not compromise the resource base. Yet surveys of actual resource use suggest that for poorer resource-dependent communities without access to markets, non-timber forest products can only ever represent a safety-net activity and a supplementary income source. Others argue that resource availability, in terms of the diversity and productivity of the forest, is the key parameter in realizing a contribution of forest products to well-being. This paper examines the scope and heterogeneity of forest product use to reveal whether resource availability necessarily provides the context for significant contributions to well-being of forest dwellers. We present data from an area of tropical rainforest, close to Iquitos in Peru, which was previously shown to have high potential value. We find, through a census survey of households within a forest reserve area, that non-timber forest products provide only a relatively small portion of income and that only a small proportion of available products are actually commercialized, despite apparent market availability. We show that the low rates of commercialization can be explained by unequal access capital assets used for extraction, to natural resources themselves, and to product markets. They are also explained by the concentration of capital-poor households on subsistence gathering activities. The value of destructive uses of forests, both logging and agriculture, remain higher than returns from non-timber products. This research demonstrates that although non-timber forest products are an important livelihood source, market integration and commercialization is not everywhere an appropriate or realistic strategy.'

Abstract: 'This work emphasises the usefulness of hemispherical photography for identifying spatial patterns in the tropical rain forest structure. Structural variability was investigated at a local (intra-site) scale, in relation to the forest mosaic, and at a regional (inter-sites) scale, for its implication in forest typology. Four primary forest sites, from 0.6 to 1 ha, were investigated in Central Sumatra, Indonesia.'

Abstract: 'A morphological comparison of specimens previously assigned to Alona eximia Kiser, 1948 from tropical Africa, Eastern Asia and the Americas shows that this species-group shares a number of morphological characters on the postabdomen, head pores, first antenna and second and fourth limb that separate them from Alona Baird, 1843 but unite them with Nicsmirnovius Chiambeng & Dumont, 1999. Alonella fitzpatricki Chien, 1970, formerly believed to be a junior synonym of A. eximia, is separated from the latter and assigned to the genus Nicsmirnovius. Two new taxa, from Africa and the Island of Socotra (Yemen) are added to the genus. The relationship between the specialised habitat of these chydorids and their morphology is discussed. The geographic range of all known populations is figured and a key to species is presented.'

Abstract: 'Primate frugivory may reduce density-dependent predation on seeds and seedlings via effective seed dispersal. Accordingly, the tendency of cercopithecines to spit and scatter seeds > 4 mm wide could represent a prominent means of dispersal. However, the importance of seed-spitting may vary according to the life history adaptations of plants. Indeed, the actions of cercopithecines may be incongruent with the reproductive biology of plants that rely on large frugivores to swallow and defecate their seeds. This possibility raises conservation concerns because large frugivores are often susceptible to extirpation or extinction from hunting and habitat fragmentation. It is therefore important to determine if cercopithecines have a compensatory effect; that is, whether or not seed-spitting effectively conveys large seeds to recruitment sites. To test this concept, we used geospatial techniques to measure and analyze the dispersion of tree species dispersed by elephants, chimpanzees, and cercopithecines to different spatial extents. We studied adult trees of Balanites wilsoniana, Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, and Uvariopsis congensis in a 2.2-ha plot in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Despite the tendency of cercopithecines to spit the seeds of Uvariopsis congensis, adult trees were highly clumped, with a modal nearest-neighbor distance of < 5 m and a crown overlap of 1.5 m. Virtually identical results for Balanites wilsoniana and Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, the seeds of which are not spat, suggest that seed-spitting may be a poor mechanism of dispersal for some large-seeded plants.'

Abstract: 'Tropical landscapes represent storehouses of medicinal drug plants. It is widely held that these medicinal resources\xe2\x80\x94real and potential\xe2\x80\x94are threatened by a host of destructive forces. This paper examines these threats, especially the process of culture change and ethnobotanical erosion, in a rural Brazilian community. Employing a quantitative analysis of a sample plant pharmacopoeia, we investigate the relationship between medicinal plant knowledge and age, gender, and socio-economic standing. The results indicate that female gender, increasing age, illiteracy, and decreasing formal education are all positively correlated with level of medicinal plant knowledge. The process of modernization, particularly increasing access to formal education, appears to be incompatible with the retention of traditional domains of medical knowledge. Increasingly perceived as an irrelevant province of past generations, knowledge of the healing powers of tropical forests and fields is rapidly declining in this community.'

Abstract: 'Research on contemporary urban waterfronts rarely looks below the surface to question the importance, role and condition of water in these settings, or the physical experiences these landscapes enable. Academics are often guilty of the same distant, spectacularised viewpoint for which they criticise waterfronts\xe2\x80\x99 designers and clients. This paper examines public perceptions and uses of urban waterfront leisure landscapes, focusing on the careful shaping of the land/water interface. It explores how designers control geographic, climatological, hydrological and urbanistic dimensions of the waterscape to create idealised urban settings that optimise consumptive leisure and place promotion. The international case studies include artificial beaches, lagoons, rivers and indoor waterscapes. The analysis foregrounds four aspects of the artificiality of urban waterfronts: taming the landscape to provide comfort and safety; augmenting the landscape to provide varied sensory stimulation; carefully positioning the waterfront within a wider climatic, thematic and functional context; and managing the temporal dimension of visitor experience.'

Abstract: 'A statistical downscaling known for producing station-scale climate information from GCM output was preferred to evaluate the impacts of climate change within the Mount Makiling forest watershed, Philippines. The lumped hydrologic BROOK90 model was utilized for the water balance assessment of climate change impacts based on two scenarios (A1B and A2) from CGCM3 experiment. The annual precipitation change was estimated to be 0.1\xe2\x80\x939.3% increase for A1B scenario, and \xe2\x88\x923.3 to 3.3% decrease/increase for the A2 scenario. Difference in the mean temperature between the present and the 2080s were predicted to be 0.6\xe2\x80\x932.2\xc2\xb0C and 0.6\xe2\x80\x933.0\xc2\xb0C under A1B and A2 scenarios, respectively. The water balance showed that 42% of precipitation is converted into evaporation, 48% into streamflow, and 10% into deep seepage loss. The impacts of climate change on water balance reflected dramatic fluctuations in hydrologic events leading to high evaporation losses, and decrease in streamflow, while groundwater flow appeared unaffected. A study on the changes in monthly water balance provided insights into the hydrologic changes within the forest watershed system which can be used in mitigating the effects of climate change.'

Abstract: 'Only recently have studies addressed the effect of early-colonizing vegetation on tree seedling survival and growth during secondary succession in tropical old fields, and few studies have elucidated the physiological responses of tree seedlings to different vegetational communities. We compared growth and various photosynthetic parameters for seedlings of four rain-forest tree species, Cedrela tonduzii, Inga punctata, Ocotea whitei, and Tapirira mexicana, growing in areas of pasture grass and shrubs in early-successional abandoned pasture in Costa Rica; in addition, we made measurements for two species in forest gaps. We tested the general hypothesis that early-colonizing shrubs facilitate growth of forest tree seedlings. Specifically, we measured microclimate, growth, CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, photosystem II quantum yield (\xce\xa6PSII), and xanthophyll pigment pools for all seedlings. Photosynthetic flux density (PFD) was higher under grass than shrubs or forest gaps, but was highly variable in each growth environment. For three of the four species, height growth was greatest in the grass compared to the shrubs and forest gaps; growth was similar below grass and shrubs for O. whitei. Photosynthetic capacity, apparent quantum yield, and stomatal conductance did not vary across habitats, but light compensation point and PFD at light saturation tended to be higher in the grass compared to forest and shrub growth environments. Water use efficiency differed across growth environments for three of the species. For plants in ambient PFD and dark-adapted plants, the efficiency of excitation energy transfer through PSII was lowest for plants in the grass compared to shrubs and forest gaps and also differed across species. Measurement of steady-state responses of \xce\xa6PSII to increasing PFD indicated a significant effect of growth environment at low PFD for all species and significant effects at high PFD only for I. punctata. All species exhibited a high degree of midday xanthophyll de-epoxidation in the different growth environments. Xanthophyll pigment pool size on an area basis was highest in the grass compared to shrubs and forest gaps for all four species. The results suggest that shrubs do not provide a facilitative effect for growth or photosynthesis for ~1.5-year-old seedlings of these four species. We conclude that site differences in success of tree seedlings during succession are a result of complex interactions of facilitation and competition and are not simply based on physiological responses to PFD.'

Abstract: 'Phytolith study is a new branch of micropaleontology with an increasingly important role in geology, archaeology, and plant taxonomy. Phytoliths have several advantages considering their characteristics of small particle size, high production, wide distribution, anti-decomposition, in situ deposition, distinctive morphologies, and element sequestrating capacity. Phytolith assemblages in modern soil have been found to be closely related to modern vegetation types and climate conditions, which forms the basis for the quantitative study of paleoecology, paleoclimate, and bio-geochemical cycles. At present, phytolith studies generally focus on the following four aspects: (1) Morphology: about 260 unduplicated types of phytoliths have been identified in modern soil, of which 110 types are from grasses, 50 types from ferns, woody plants and other angiosperms, whereas the origin plants of the remaining 100 types are still under investigation. (2) Soil phytolith assemblages and vegetation: phytolith assemblages from the topsoil have been used to distinguish surface vegetation types including different forests and grasslands over a typical region. This model has been applied to restore past vegetation conditions and monitor the dynamic evolution of specific vegetation types at different temporal and spatial scales. (3) Soil phytolith assemblages and climate: quantitative and semi-quantitative relationships between phytolith assemblages and a series of climate parameters, such as annual mean temperature, annual mean precipitation and altitude, have been established through mathematical analysis. In this manner, quantitative reconstruction of paleoclimatic parameters has been achieved through the phytolith-climate transfer function model. (4) Soil phytolith and its sequestered elements: in this topic, the content of soil PhytOC (Phytolith-occluded Organic Carbon) and the importance of PhytOC in the bio-geochemical cycle have been the focus. The study of modern soil phytoliths has provided new approaches and many successful cases for solving specific problems in various fields, such as Earth science and archaeology. This study analyzed existing issues in addition to the abovementioned significant progresses, and provides directions for future research on modern soil phytoliths.'

Abstract: 'Botanists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists are familiar with the astonishing species richness and endemism of the fynbos of the Cape Floristic Region and the ancient and unique flora of the kwongkan of south-western Australia. These regions represent old climatically-buffered infertile landscapes (OCBILs) that are the basis of a general hypothesis to explain their richness and endemism. However, few ecologists are familiar with the campo rupestre of central and eastern Brazil, an extremely old mountaintop ecosystem that is both a museum of ancient lineages and a cradle of continuing diversification of endemic lineages.'

Abstract: 'We report the diversity of plants used by the Garifuna focusing on medicinals. Garifuna plants documented in this study are distributed among 75 families, 193 genera, and 254 species. Included are 229 medicinals, 93 food plants, and 94 species for other uses. Garifuna medicinals treat more than 30 human ailments and most are native (74%) to eastern Nicaragua. About 70% of the medicinals have some bioactive principle, most are herbs (37%) or trees (34%), and leaves are the most frequently utilized plant part. Most are prepared as decoctions and are administered orally. Most food plants are domesticates, and only 14 of 51 domesticated food species are native to the NW tropics with only three to Mesoamerica. Garifuna culture is changing rapidly as a result of contact with immigrating mestizos from central Nicaragua. This study provides a written record of folk medicine and ethnobotany for the people of eastern Nicaragua.'

Abstract: 'This study examined the photosynthetic acclimation of pre-existing Shorea johorensis (Dipterocarpaceae) seedlings to the change in conditions that occurs at the time of logging in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The hypothesis was that the seedlings would be unable to acclimate beyond partially open conditions after canopy disturbance caused by logging, therefore limiting the potential for regeneration in the most open areas. Bleaching and reductions in the predawn ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) indicated chronic photoinhibition and damage to the previously shade-adapted leaves of seedlings in an area logged 2 weeks earlier. The majority of seedlings in partially open and open environments of an area logged 3 months earlier were already growing fast. Leaves that had developed in the new environment showed only small reductions in predawn Fv/Fm and large increases in the light saturated rate of photosynthesis (Amax) per unit area when compared to shaded seedlings. Leaves in the most open environments had higher but more variable nitrogen concentrations, Amax per unit area and Amax per unit mass when compared to seedlings in partially open environments. Increases in dark respiration were disproportionately large compared to increases in Amax, and may have been the result of increased investment in photoprotective mechanisms. The response of stomatal conductance to the vapour pressure deficit and leaf temperature was examined, but it suggested only a 10% reduction in daily leaf level carbon gain in open environments. The ratio of leaf area to fine root mass was highest in shade-suppressed and newly exposed seedlings, suggesting a potential hydraulic limitation to transpiration during acclimation. However, rainfall during this period was high and leaf water potentials did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed environments. S. johorensis seedlings were capable of significant acclimation to conditions more extreme than partial canopy opening. Low seedling density after logging during the wet season cannot be explained by a limited potential for photosynthetic acclimation.'

Abstract: 'In this brief communication we provide an estimate of the part of the incident solar energy used for oxygen evolution as well as the time, in years, needed for the generation of the present amount of molecular oxygen in the biosphere by photosynthesis on land and in the ocean. We find this to be \xe2\x89\x883,000 yr. We also find that the ocean produces 22% more oxygen than the land surface.'

Abstract: 'Nitrogen budgets of late successional forested stands and watersheds provide baseline data against which the effects of small- and large-scale disturbances may be measured. Using previously published data and supplemental new data on gaseous N loss, we construct a N budget for hillslope tabonuco forest (HTF) stands in Puerto Rico. HTF stands are subject to frequent hurricanes and landslides; here, we focus on N fluxes in the late phase of inter-disturbance forest development. N inputs from atmospheric deposition (4--6 kg N/ha/yr) are exceeded by N outputs from groundwater, gaseous N loss, and particulate N loss (6.3--15.7 kg N/ha/yr). Late-successional HTF stands also sequester N in their aggrading biomass (8 kg N/ha/yr), creating a total budget imbalance of 8.3--19.7 kg N/ha/yr. We surmise that this imbalance may be accounted for by unmeasured inputs from above- and belowground N-fixation and/or slow depletion of the large N pool in soil organic matter. Spatial and temporal variability, especially that associated with gaseous exchange and soil organic matter N-mineralization, constrain the reliability of this N budget.'

Abstract: 'Several studies relating land cover to stream properties have used sample sizes of more than 100 watersheds, but the variance that they explain is moderate to low (R 2 less than 50%), limiting the predictive value of these studies when their models are applied to watersheds that were not included in the models\xe2\x80\x99 development. We hypothesize that this is due to the increases in variation that occur with increases in sample size and in the geographic scales of the areas in which the watersheds are distributed. Land cover alone cannot explain all of that variation; more predictors must be considered. Conversely, models with high explicative power would require relatively small sample sizes distributed over small areas. This hypothesis was evaluated sampling 17 watersheds from southern Chile\xe2\x80\x99s Lake Region, for which we developed regressive models between land cover/watershed area/precipitation/geomorphology and stream properties (i.e., conductivity, temperature). With a maximum n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa015 watersheds, on a regional scale, a poorly explained variation in hydrologic variables (mean 37\xe2\x80\x9349%) was obtained. The R 2 increased slightly, to 45\xe2\x80\x9352%, when precipitation was included as a predictor. In half of the cases analyzed, the models improved when geomorphology was considered as an additional predictor (60\xe2\x80\x9366%), supporting our hypothesis. Furthermore, when our analysis was restricted to a narrower latitudinal span (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09), the R 2 was much stronger (68\xe2\x80\x9387%) when only land cover and watershed area were included as predictors. These percentages also increased when more predictors were incorporated. Nevertheless, a portion of unexplained variance remained that would require the consideration of more predictors, such as geology and edaphology. The documented trade-off provides evidence that argues against the spatial generality of land cover/stream property models.'

Abstract: 'The not yet uploaded Trichoptera World Checklist (TWC) [http://entweb.clemson.edu/database/trichopt/search.htm], as at July 2006, recorded 12,627 species, 610 genera and 46 families of extant and in addition 488 species, 78 genera and 7 families of fossil Trichoptera. An analysis of the 2001 TWC list of present-day Trichoptera diversity at species, generic/subgeneric and family level along the selected Afrotropical, Neotropical, Australian, Oriental, Nearctic and Palaearctic (as a unit or assessed as Eastern and Western) regions reveals uneven distribution patterns. The Oriental and Neotropical are the two most species diverse with 47\xe2\x80\x9377% of the species in widespread genera being recorded in these two regions. Five Trichoptera families comprise 55% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s species and 19 families contain fewer than 30 species per family. Ten out of 620 genera contain 29% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s known species. Considerable underestimates of Trichoptera diversity for certain regions are recognised. Historical processes in Trichoptera evolution dating back to the middle and late Triassic reveal that the major phylogenetic differentiation in Trichoptera had occurred during the Jurrasic and early Cretaceous. The breakup of Gondwana in the Cretaceous led to further isolation and diversification of Trichoptera. High species endemism is noted to be in tropical or mountainous regions correlated with humid or high rainfall conditions. Repetitive patterns of shared taxa between biogeographical regions suggest possible centres of origin, vicariant events or distribution routes. Related taxa associations between different regions suggest that an alternative biogeographical map reflecting Trichoptera distribution patterns different from the Wallace (The Geographical Distribution of Animals: With a Study of the Relations of Living and Extinct Faunas as Elucidating the Past Changes of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Surface, Vol. 1, 503 pp., Vol. 2, 607 pp., Macmillan, London, 1876) proposed biogeography patterns should be considered. Anthropogenic development threatens biodiversity and the value of Trichoptera as important functional components of aquatic ecosystems, indicator species of deteriorating conditions and custodians of environmental protection are realised.'

Abstract: 'Enrichment planting is commonly used for increasing the density of desired tree species in secondary forests often characterized by a prevalence of low commercial species. The objectives of the study were to identify the optimal enrichment planting method vis-\xc3\xa0-vis gap and line planting, and to evaluate the performance of two dipterocarps (Vatica cinerea and Dipterocarpus alatus) and three legumes (Afzelia xylocarpa, Pterocarpus macrocarpus, Dalbergia cochinchinensis) planted in logged-over mixed deciduous forest of Laos. The enrichment planting trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design with seven replications. Survival, height and diameter were measured seven years after planting and subjected to analysis of variance. Survival rate of planted seedlings did not vary between enrichment planting (p > 0.05). However, diameter and height growth was favored more in gaps than in planting lines. This was related to rapid canopy closure in both gaps and lines, albeit more remarkable in planting lines. Significant inter-species variation was detected for survival rate, height and diameter. The shade-tolerant dipterocarps had better survival and growth than the light-demanding leguminous species (p < 0.0001). The size class distribution of individuals was irregular, accentuating uneven light condition in the understory. Given the difficulty to maintain constant line width and even light condition, the cost of annual clean operation and the rigid geometric patterns of planting lines, the use of logged-over gaps for enrichment planting is recommended. Dipterocarpus alatus and V. cinerea are recommended for enrichment planting in mixed deciduous forests. A. xylocarpa, D. cochichinensis and P. macrocarpus can be planted in wider gaps, lines and open sites as plantation of mixed species or under canopy of young swidden forests.'

Abstract: 'Amblyomma incisum Neumann is a major tick species in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Tapir is the main host for adult ticks and a high aggressiveness of nymphs to humans has been reported. In this work data on the biology and life cycle of this tick species is presented for the first time. It was shown that horse is a suitable host for A. incisum adults and rabbit for larvae and nymphs. It was also shown that A. incisum is a big tick species (mean engorged female weight of 1.96\xc2\xa0g) with a long life cycle which lasts 262.3\xc2\xa0days when maintained at 27\xc2\xb0C and 85% RH. These laboratory conditions were, however, inappropriate and egg hatching rate (1.2%) was very low. Nevertheless egg hatching of ticks in a forest patch increased considerably (72.2%) indicating that this A. incisum population is highly dependent on a forest-like environment.'

Abstract: 'Geographic patterns of biodiversity result from broad-scale biogeographic and present-day ecological processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of biogeographic history and ecology driving patterns of diversity in modern primate communities in Madagascar. I collected data on endemic lemur species co-occurrence from range maps and survey literature for 100 communities in protected areas. I quantified and compared taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions of intra- and intersite diversity. I tested environmental and geographic predictors of diversity and endemism. I calculated deforestation rates within protected areas between the years 2000 and 2014, and tested if diversity is related to forest cover and loss. I found the phylogenetic structure of lemur communities could be explained primarily by remotely sensed plant productivity, supporting the hypothesis that there was ecological differentiation among ecoregions, while functional-trait disparity was not strongly related to environment. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity also increased with increasing topographic heterogeneity. Beta diversity was explained by both differences in ecology among localities and potential river barriers. Approximately 3000\xc2\xa0km2 were deforested in protected areas since the year 2000, threatening the most diverse communities (up to 31%/park). The strong positive association of plant productivity and topographic heterogeneity with lemur diversity indicates that high productivity, rugged landscapes support greater diversity. Both ecology and river barriers influenced lemur community ecology and biogeography. These results underscore the need for focused conservation efforts to slow the loss of irreplaceable evolutionary and ecological diversity.'

Abstract: ' Most Neotropical primate species possess a polymorphic X-linked and a monomorphic autosomal color vision gene. Consequently, populations are composed of both dichromatics and trichromatics. Most theories on the maintenance of this genetic system revolve around possible advantages for foraging ecology. To examine the issue from a different angle, we compared the numbers and relative frequencies of alleles at the X-linked locus among three species of Saimiri representing a wide range of geographical and behavioral variation in the genus. Exons 3, 4, and 5 of the X-linked opsin gene were sequenced for a large number of X chromosomes for all three species. Several synonymous mutations were detected in exons 4 and 5 for the originally reported alleles but only a single nonsynonymous change was detected. Two alleles were found that appeared to be the result of recombination events. The low occurrence of recombinant alleles and absence of mutations in the amino acids critical for spectral tuning indicates that stabilizing selection acts to maintain the combinations of critical sites specific to each allele. Allele frequencies were approximately the same for all Saimiri species, with a slight but significant difference between S. boliviensis and S. oerstedii. No apparent correlation exists between allele frequencies and behavioral or biogeographical differences between species, casting doubt on the speculation that the spectral sensitivities of the alleles have been maintained because they are specifically well-tuned to Saimiri visual ecology. Rather, the spectral tuning peaks might have been maintained because they are as widely spaced as possible within the limited range of middlewave to longwave spectra useful to all primates. This arrangement creates a balance between maximizing the distance between spectral tuning peaks (allowing the color opponency of the visual system to distinguish between peaks) and maximizing the number of alleles within a limited range (yielding the greatest possible frequency of heterozygotes).'

Abstract: 'Irradiance data software developed by the NREL Solar Radiation Laboratory (Simple Model of Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine, SMARTS) has been used for modelling photosynthesis. Spectra and total irradiance were expressed in terms of quanta [mol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921, photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD (400\xe2\x80\x93700 nm)]. Using the SMARTS software it is possible to (1) calculate the solar spectrum for a planar surface for any given solar elevation angle, allowing for the attenuating effects of the atmosphere on extraterrestrial irradiance at each wavelength in the 400\xe2\x80\x93700 nm range and for the thickness of atmosphere the light must pass through during the course of a day, (2) calculate PPFD vs. solar time for any latitude and date and (3) estimate total daily irradiance for any latitude and date and hence calculate the total photon irradiance for a whole year or for a growing season. Models of photosynthetic activity vs. PPFD are discussed. Gross photosynthesis (P g) vs. photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) (P g vs. I) characteristics of single leaves compared to that of a canopy of leaves are different. It is shown that that the optimum irradiance for a leaf (Iopt) is the half-saturation irradiance for a battery of leaves in series. A C3 plant, with leaves having an optimum photosynthetic rate at 700 \xce\xbcmol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 PPFD, was used as a realistic worked example. The model gives good estimates of gross photosynthesis (P g) for a given date and latitude. Seasonal and annual estimates of P g can be made. Taking cloudiness into account, the model predicts maximum P g rates of about 10 g(C) m\xe2\x88\x922 d\xe2\x88\x921, which is close to the maximum reported P g experimental measurements.'

Abstract: ' We present field and laboratory data on the Neotropical formicine ant Gigantiops destructor (Fabricius), the sole species of its genus and tribe. Monogynous and polydomous colonies of G. destructor from French Guiana are distributed along the rainforest edges or along streams with a nest density of about 300 nests/ha. The species presents rudimentary nesting habits, as most nests are found in pre-existing cavities in the ground, but some can be found in the hollowed internodes of Cecropia trees fallen onto the ground. A worker, sometimes hidden in a separate "sentry box", might guard the nest entrance. Colony size can reach several hundreds of workers. The foraging activity of the workers is strictly diurnal with a peak between 9:30 and 11:30. This largest-eyed of all known ant species has remarkable leaping abilities even more impressive than in other jumping ants. Workers are generalist solitary foragers. They collect extra-floral nectar from different plant species and prey on various small live arthropods that they detect visually before tracking and jumping on them. The same individual can forage both on prey and sugary sources during a single foraging trip. Foragers can eat their prey on site and never recruit nestmates in the field or even after a starvation period in the laboratory. They feed larvae with chewed prey. The complete lack of cooperation between foraging workers that can also fight for a prey with a nestmate, combined with the absence of any recruitment for large food sources, constitute a cluster of individualist traits rather unusual for an eusocial insect.'

Abstract: 'Global climate change may have a serious impact on genetic resources in tropical forest trees. Genetic diversity plays a critical role in the survival of populations in rapidly changing environments. Furthermore, most tropical plant species are known to have unique ecological niches, and therefore changes in climate may directly affect the distribution of biomes, ecosystems, and constituent species. Climate change may also indirectly affect plant genetic resources through effects on phenology, breeding systems, and plant-pollinator and plant seed disperser interactions, and may reduce genetic diversity and reproductive output. As a consequence, population densities may be reduced leading to reduction in genetic diversity through genetic drift and inbreeding. Tropical forest plants may respond to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, adaptive evolution, migration to suitable site, or extinction. However, the potential to respond is limited by a rapid pace of change and the non-availability of alternate habitats due to past and present trends of deforestation. Thus climate change may result in extinction of many populations and species. Our ability to estimate the precise response of tropical forest ecosystems to climate change is limited by lack of long-term data on parameters that might be affected by climate change. Collection of correlative data from long-term monitoring of climate as well as population and community responses at selected sites offer the most cost-effective way to understand the effects of climate change on tropical tree populations. However, mitigation strategies need to be implemented immediately. Because many effects of climate change may be similar to the effects of habitat alteration and fragmentation, protected areas and buffer zones should be enlarged, with an emphasis on connectivity among conserved landscapes. Taxa that are likely to become extinct should be identified and protected through ex situ conservation programs.'

Abstract: ' Litter processing by macroinvertebrates typically involves suites of species that act together to determine rates of breakdown and decomposition. However, tropical oceanic islands and coastal fringes on continents are often dominated by one or a few species of omnivorous land crabs that consume leaf litter. We used an exclusion experiment, together with other leaf removal and litter decomposition studies, to assess the role of a single dominant species, the red crab (Gecarcoidea natalis), in litter dynamics in rain forest on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. In the presence of red crabs, litter cover and biomass varied seasonally, from almost complete cover and high biomass at the end of the dry season to almost total absence of litter at the end of each wet season. When crabs were excluded from both the shaded understory and light gaps in rain forest, litter increased rapidly to almost complete cover, which was then maintained year round. Leaf tether experiments, and measures of litter input and standing crops, indicated that red crabs monopolize litter processing, removing between 39 and 87% of the annual leaf fall from the forest floor. Rates of litter turnover were over twice as high in the presence of land crabs: the decomposition constant, k, was 2.6 in the understory exclusion plots, but rose to 6.0 in the presence of crabs. Red crabs occur at biomass densities (114\xe2\x80\x89g\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x88\x922) far greater than those reported elsewhere for entire litter faunas. They significantly reduced the abundance of other litter invertebrates, but we did not detect any change in the relative frequencies of the major invertebrate groups (mites, collembolans, pulmonate snails, ants, psocopterans, and spiders). Wherever omnivorous land crabs are abundant, their activities may be paramount in litter decomposition and in regulating the rate of nutrient cycling. In monopolizing litter processing, they may also be important physical \xe2\x80\x9cecosystem engineers\xe2\x80\x9d, translocating organic matter and nutrients into the soil and reducing available habitat for other animals.'

Abstract: "The ecosystem function for water retention in a watershed of the Yangtze River was discussed in this study. The watershed was divided into 90 types of vegetation\xe2\x80\x93soil\xe2\x80\x93slope complex. A GIS-embodied spatial database was used to explore the relationships between the capacity of water retention by a complex and its types of vegetation, soil and slope. Furthermore, the capacity of water retention of every complex was estimated statistically by using estimation models. The spatial distribution of various capacity of water retention in the watershed was demarcated on a map based on the attributions and the locations of complexes. In addition, we evaluated integrally the situation of water retention in the watershed based on the estimation for the complexes from which it was distinctly recognized that the serious situation mainly results from the poor capacity of water retention of vegetation. The variation-location effect describes the phenomenon in which an identical variation of a factor may produce different effects on overall situation, when this variation occurs in a different spatial location. According to the variation-location effect on the expansion of forestland, a strategy 'spatial pattern-based forestland extension\xe2\x80\x99 was proposed to conserve forest ecosystem and improve the situation of water retention in the watershed."

Abstract: 'A climate change mitigation mechanism for emissions reduction from reduced deforestation and forest degradation, plus forest conservation, sustainable management of forest, and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+), has received an international political support in the climate change negotiations. The mechanism will require, among others, an unprecedented technical capacity for monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon emissions from the forest sector. A functional monitoring, reporting and verification requires inventories of forest area, carbon stock and changes, both for the construction of forest reference emissions level and compiling the report on the actual emissions, which are essentially lacking in developing countries, particularly in Africa. The purpose of this essay is to contribute to a better understanding of the state and prospects of forest monitoring and reporting in the context of REDD+ in Africa. We argue that monitoring and reporting capacities in Africa fall short of the stringent requirements of the methodological guidance for monitoring, reporting and verification for REDD+, and this may weaken the prospects for successfully implementing REDD+ in the continent. We presented the challenges and prospects in the national forest inventory, remote sensing and reporting infrastructures. A North\xe2\x80\x93South, South\xe2\x80\x93South collaboration as well as governments own investments in monitoring, reporting and verification system could help Africa leapfrog in monitoring and reporting. These could be delivered through negotiations for the transfer of technology, technical capacities, and experiences that exist among developed countries that traditionally compile forest carbon reports in the context of the Kyoto protocol.'

Abstract: ' Soil texture plays a key role in belowground C storage in forest ecosystems and strongly influences nutrient availability and retention, particularly in highly weathered soils. We used field data and the Century ecosystem model to explore the role of soil texture in belowground C storage, nutrient pool sizes, and N fluxes in highly weathered soils in an Amazonian forest ecosystem. Our field results showed that sandy soils stored approximately 113 Mg C ha-1 to a 1-m depth versus 101 Mg C ha-1 in clay soils. Coarse root C represented a large and significant ecosystem C pool, amounting to 62% and 48% of the surface soil C pool on sands and clays, respectively, and 34% and 22% of the soil C pool on sands and clays to 1-m depth. The quantity of labile soil P, the soil C:N ratio, and live and dead fine root biomass in the 0\xe2\x80\x9310-cm soil depth decreased along a gradient from sands to clays, whereas the opposite trend was observed for total P, mineral N, potential N mineralization, and denitrification enzyme activity. The Century model was able to predict the observed trends in surface soil C and N in loams and sands but underestimated C and N pools in the sands by approximately 45%. The model predicted that total belowground C (0\xe2\x80\x9320 cm depth) in sands would be approximately half that of the clays, in contrast to the 89% we measured. This discrepancy is likely to be due to an underestimation of the role of belowground C allocation with low litter quality in sands, as well as an overestimation of the role of physical C protection by clays in this ecosystem. Changes in P and water availability had little effect on model outputs, whereas adding N greatly increased soil organic matter pools and productivity, illustrating the need for further integration of model structure and tropical forest biogeochemical cycling.'

Abstract: 'In 2007, Brazil entered the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s (EU) list of strategic partners; a token of recognition of the place Brazil occupies in current global affairs. Although promoting bilateral environmental convergence is a stated priority, cooperation between the EU and Brazil in this policy field is largely under-researched, raising interesting questions as to whether the current state of play could support EU claims for the normative orientation of its external environmental policy. Through an analysis of partnership activities in the fields of deforestation and biofuels, we suggest that while normative intentions may be regarded as a motivating force, critically viewing EU foreign environmental policy through a \xe2\x80\x98soft imperialism\xe2\x80\x99 lens could offer a more holistic understanding of the current state of bilateral cooperation. While the normative power thesis can be substantiated with regard to deforestation, we argue that by erecting barriers to shield its domestic biofuels production, the EU is placing trade competitiveness and economic growth above its normative aspirations. Subsequently, the partial adoption of sustainable development as an EU norm leads to policy incoherence and contradictory actions.'

Abstract: 'The genus Philodendron is a highly diverse Neotropical group of the monocot family Araceae. Despite chromosome counts being relatively abundant for the family, information on the karyotype evolution within the genus is still scarce and very confusing. Therefore, we report diploid numbers and additional cytological features for 43 species of Philodendron, discussing the importance of our results and reviewing previous data. Species were collected in four different Brazilian biomes (Caatinga, Cerrado, Amazon basin and Atlantic Forest) and chromosome counts were based on Giemsa standard staining procedures. First chromosome counts are given for 35 species, while for another eight species counts are reported for new provenances. The majority of the species (27) presented the diploid number of 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa032, while the number 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa034, the second most frequent, was observed in eight taxa. Uncommon chromosome numbers were observed for seven species: P. callosum and P. uliginosum with 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa028, P. hastatum and P. melinonii with 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa030, P. corcovadense and P. saxicola with 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa036 and P. brevispathum with 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa040. On the other hand, two species showed variation in chromosome numbers among analysed cells: P. insigne with 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9332 and P. pulchrum with 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9328. Regarding chromosome morphologies, a prevalence of submetacentric and metacentric pairs could be observed in most species, with some taxa having a tendency to asymmetry and a higher number of acrocentric pairs. A list of all available chromosomal data is presented, considering the actual taxonomic circumscription and synonyms. Considering the present analysis and the literature data, we suggest n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa016 instead of n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa018 as the primary basic number of the genus, from which secondary base numbers n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa017, 18 and (less frequently) 15, 14 and 13 have probably been derived. Dysploidy seems to be the prevalent karyoevolutionary trend within the genus.'

Abstract: 'Under the same climatic and edaphic conditions, native savanna vegetation in Brazil, the Cerrado, shows a lower stature and canopy cover than planted Pinus caribaea Morelet forests. To assess the differences in biogeochemical element cycling we compared the nutrient economy of Cerrado and Pinus on three replicate plots of each forest type. The mean nutrient storage in the soil organic layer under Pinus (N: 2630; P: 141; K: 103; Ca: 131; Mg: 20 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921) was substantially higher than under Cerrado (N: 23; P: 1.2; K: 0.83; Ca: 5.8; Mg: 1.0 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921) probably because the Pinus roots explored a larger soil volume. The Pinus trees had a higher nutrient-use efficiency as indicated by higher mean litter mass per unit nutrient in litter (N: 108; P: 2290; K: 729; Ca: 1360; Mg: 5420; S: 1190; Fe: 2960; Mn: 9990, Zn: 145000) than the Cerrado trees (N: 94; P: 1810; K: 619; Ca: 302; Mg: 938, S: 746; Fe: 1800; Mn: 7880; Zn: 63700). Mean annual small litterfall collected in 0.25-m2 samplers between May 1997 and April 1999 was 2.1 Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Cerrado and 7.8 in Pinus. The litterfall rates of the 1\xe2\x80\x933 week collection intervals correlated negatively with the soil matric potential indicating that litterfall was partly related to water stress. The fluxes of N (73 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921), P (3.7), K (11), S (7.0), and Mn (0.83) to the soil with litterfall under Pinus were greater than the litterfall+turnover of the grass/herbs layer under Cerrado (N: 39, P: 2.8, K: 8.6, S: 5.4, Mn: 0.79 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921), those of Zn (0.06\xe2\x80\x930.07) were similar, and those of Ca (Pinus: 5.9/Cerrado: 10), Mg (1.5/4.4), and Fe (2.9/4.0) were smaller. Mean residence times of the organic matter and of all elements were longer in the soil organic layer under Pinus (3.7\xe2\x80\x9326 years in the Oi horizon, 8.1\xe2\x80\x93907 years in the whole organic layer) than under Cerrado (0.22\xe2\x80\x933.6 years in the Oi horizon, the only organic horizon under Cerrado). Our results demonstrate that the main differences in biogeochemical element cycling between the Pinus forest and the Cerrado consisted of a larger nutrient storage in the organic layer, a higher nutrient-use efficiency, and slower nutrient release rates from the organic layer in the Pinus forest than in the Cerrado. Nutrient cycling as assessed by the nutrient fluxes with litterfall was only partly faster in the Pinus forest than in the Cerrado.'

Abstract: 'An important factor in determining species rarity is the geographic distribution of species. Estimates were made of the level of endemism of the flora of two sites in the southern Bahian wet forest zone. Estimates were made for endemism in the Atlantic forest biome and for the much more restricted area of southern Bahia and northern Espi\xc2\xb4rito Santo and are derived from analyses of the distributions of the species known from each area. The species checklist for each area is based on identified specimens resulting from intensive collecting in a forest near Serra Grande (40km north of Ilhe\xc2\xb4us) and the Una Biological Reserve (40km south of Ilhe\xc2\xb4us). Slightly less than half of the species (45.2% at Una and 47.7% at Serra Grande) have widespread distributions and 7.4% at each site are disjunct between the coastal forests and Amazonia. In the Una Reserve, 44.1% of the species are endemic to the coastal forest and 28.1% endemic to southern Bahia and northern Espi\xc2\xb4rito Santo. At Serra Grande, 41.6% of the species are endemic to the coastal forest and 26.5% endemic to southern Bahia and northern Espi\xc2\xb4rito Santo.'

Abstract: 'Besides whole discussions concerning the influence of environment heterogeneity on species distribution, communities are still treated as enclosed units. With that in mind, we sampled one grid of 100\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa030\xc2\xa0m, aiming to analyze the composition variation of fern communities in a transition forest fragment between a tropical Brazilian savanna and the Amazonian forest. Sampling was conducted for evaluating the composition variation in riparian areas. Multivariate analysis was employed to summarize the species composition, while multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate whether the distance from a watercourse, as well as canopy openings, would influence the composition of species along these gradients. This composition was affected by the distance from the watercourse, but was not influenced by canopy opening. Species composition was diverse along the stream distance gradient, from marginal area of streams to the edge of the slope. Individual density and species richness were not influenced by canopy opening, yet they decreased as the distance from the river increased. These results highlight the significance of environmental heterogeneity in the distribution of species in riparian areas, which must be considered when planning vegetation conservation in these regions.'

Abstract: 'N limitation to primary production and other ecosystem processes is widespread. To understand the causes and distribution of N limitation, we must understand the controls of biological N fixation. The physiology of this process is reasonably well characterized, but our understanding of ecological controls is sparse, except in a few cultivated ecosystems. We review information on the ecological controls of N fixation in free-living cyanobacteria, vascular plant symbioses, and heterotrophic bacteria, with a view toward developing improved conceptual and simulation models of ecological controls of biological N fixation.'

Abstract: 'Mosquitoes are important vectors of several diseases, including malaria and dengue, and control measures are mostly performed using chemical insecticides. Unfortunately, mosquito resistance to commonly applied insecticides is widespread. Therefore, a prospection for new molecules with insecticidal activity based on Amazon biodiversity using the anurans Leptodactylus knudseni and Phyllomedusa vaillantii was performed against the mosquito species Anopheles darlingi and Aedes aegypti.'

Abstract: 'The carbon isotopic composition (\xce\x9414C, \xce\xb413C) and apparent ages of suspended sediment were determined in the Pearl River in the years 1998, 2000 and 2005. These results indicate that suspended POC consists mostly of young carbon and some \xe2\x80\x9cold carbon\xe2\x80\x9d. Apparent ages of suspended POC range from 540 to 2050 a BP. The apparent ages are older in the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers, while these values are variable in the Dongjiang River, including old and young samples. The suspended POC \xce\xb413C values increase with increasing \xce\x9414C in the Pearl River, indicating that its source is soil and bedrock from depths under 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm. Since the organic carbon of the surface soil is quickly decomposed when it enters the rivers, its carbon isotopic characteristics are insignificant in suspended sediment. In the Pearl River drainage basin, there are areas with more severe soil erosion than others. For example, erosion is much more severe in the Xijiang River drainage basin when compared to the light soil erosion in the Dongjiang River drainage basin.'

Abstract: 'Mapping geographic trends in biodiversity is a key step in conservation planning, which has been mainly focused on taxonomic criteria or species of particular concern. More recently, higher consideration of ecosystem functioning has been advocated, allocating more attention to traits and functional diversity of species assemblages. Carnivorans (Mammalia: Carnivora) are charismatic, albeit threatened, species that variously affect ecosystem functioning through consumptive processes, and whose functional diversity depends on traits associated with their trophic habits and energetic requirements. Yet, analyses of spatial trends in the diversity and vulnerability of carnivoran assemblages have mostly focused on taxonomic and phylogenetic criteria. Then, the present study assessed the vulnerability of the functional richness of South American carnivoran assemblages, both at continental and regional levels. As a first diagnostic of vulnerability, the form of the association between functional richness and species richness (FRS) was assessed through simulations. The resulting nearly linear association indicated low functional redundancy and high sensitivity to global extinctions. A more realistic FRS accounting for actual extinction threats exacerbated losses of functional richness. Further, a positive correlation between effect and response traits suggests non-compensatory responses to environmental stressors by functionally redundant species and, thus, sensitivity of carnivoran functional richness to ongoing trends in land conversion and habitat degradation. Regionally, functional richness paralleled latitudinal gradients in species richness, but vulnerability did not entirely match these variables in space, nor did it risk estimates that accounted for regions\xe2\x80\x99 conservation status. This suggests regional differentiation in conservation priorities, complementing existing taxonomically oriented prioritization schemes.'

Abstract: 'Bolivia is a low-latitude, developing country at grave risk to the deleterious effects of human-induced climate changes. Due to the complexity of the topography in Bolivia, it is difficult to capture future impacts of the climate change on the regional scale with the coarse resolution of current GCMs. A robust strategy has been developed to dynamically downscale the GCM outputs to a more appropriate temporal and spatial resolution for impact studies. Prior to downscaling, however, evaluation of the GCMs used to provide large-scale forcing is a necessary step to ensure physically meaningful results from regional climate models. This study represents the first part of a broader project on evaluating climate change impacts over Bolivia. We examined precipitation, temperature, wind patterns and moisture transport to evaluate the performance of eight CMIP5 GCMs in simulating the continental and regional climate patterns. Phenomena including the seasonal and monthly positions of the intertropical convergence zone, South Atlantic convergence zone, Bolivian high, Chaco low and South American low-level jet, were analyzed. Our results confirm that, in general, all the GCMs do reasonably well in simulating the basic patterns of the variables with some discrepancies in magnitude across models, especially in the regional scale. Some models outperform the others for the variables and the region of our interest. Finally, the results of this research will help improve quantifying the uncertainty range of further regional downscaling outputs.'

Abstract: 'The hydro-climatic variability of the Colombian Andes associated with El Ni\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x93Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is reviewed using records of rainfall, river discharges, soil moisture, and a vegetation index (NDVI) as a surrogate for evapotranspiration. Anomalies in the components of the surface water balance during both phases of ENSO are quantified in terms of their sign, timing, and magnitude. During El Ni\xc3\xb1o (La Ni\xc3\xb1a), the region experiences negative (positive) anomalies in rainfall, river discharges (average and extremes), soil moisture, and NDVI. ENSO\xe2\x80\x99s effects are phase-locked to the seasonal cycle, being stronger during December\xe2\x80\x93February, and weaker during March\xe2\x80\x93May. Besides, rainfall and river discharges anomalies show that the ENSO signal exhibits a westerly wave-like propagation, being stronger (weaker) and earlier (later) over the western (eastern) Andes. Soil moisture anomalies are land-cover type dependant, but overall they are enhanced by ENSO, showing very low values during El Ni\xc3\xb1o (mainly during dry seasons), but saturation values during La Ni\xc3\xb1a. A suite of large-scale and regional mechanisms cooperating at the ocean\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere\xe2\x80\x93land system are reviewed to explaining the identified hydro-climatic anomalies. This review contributes to an understanding of the hydro-climatic framework of a region identified as the most critical hotspot for biodiversity on Earth, and constitutes a wake-up call for scientists and policy-makers alike, to take actions and mobilize resources and minds to prevent the further destruction of the region\xe2\x80\x99s valuable hydrologic and biodiversity resources and ecosystems. It also sheds lights towards the implementation of strategies and adaptation plans to coping with threats from global environmental change.'

Abstract: 'Plant uses by the Pokomo and their influence on riverine forest structure and composition are examined in the Tana River National Primate Reserve, Kenya. Of a total 98 plant species identified with one or more uses, 15 are used as food, 34 for construction material, 43 for technology, 23 for remedy, 2 for commerce, and 20 for other uses. The mean basal area of cut wood is 3.21 m2/ha, mostly from palms (1.96 m2/ha) and understory trees (1.20 m2/ha). Measured impacts on forest structure include the loss of large trees for canoes or beehives, lowered palm heights, and tree coppicing. Accessibility explains much of the spatial pattern of use. Extraction activities do not reduce forest area, and causal effects on productivity are complicated by the heterogeneous environment and past disturbances. In view of regional pressures on forests and cultural traditions, limited resource extraction offers incentives for local stewardship of a unique ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Based on reports that variables related to photosynthesis (net assimilatory ratio and chloroplast pigments) are more plastic than the morphological and biochemical variables in a climax tropical species, Cariniana estrellensis, under contrasting irradiance, we hypothesised that plasticity of gas exchange variables is higher in relation to growth, biochemical and anatomical variables. Plants that were 14\xc2\xa0months old were subjected to 200 up to 2000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921 of photo synthetically active radiation (PAR) for 140\xc2\xa0days. Growth increased up to 1400\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921 PAR and then decreased at 2000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921 PAR (full sunlight). This was related to the rate of photosynthesis (A) which showed the same tendency as photosystem II performance index (PIABS). The greater thickness of the secondary xylem at 1400\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5mol\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921 PAR indicated a higher water conductance capacity. The decrease in specific leaf area, elongation of mesophyll cells, and increase in stomatal density observed at higher irradiances were associated with higher leaf fructose and sucrose concentrations. We concluded that the better growth in partial shade was due to higher photosynthetic capacity. On the other hand, photosynthesis was inhibited equally in full sun and deep shade. The high adjustment capacity of C. estrellensis to wide amplitudes of irradiance was provided by greater plasticity of gas exchange variables in relation to growth, anatomical, and biochemical variables.'

Abstract: 'Phylogenetic relationships among South American sigmodontine rodents were examined based on the complete sequence for the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene [1140 base pairs (bp)] for 66 species and between 759 and 1140 bp for an additional 19 species. Thirty-eight South American genera were represented, coming from eight of nine tribes. Outgroups included the North American murid rodents Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, Scotinomys, and Neotoma, the Old World murine rodents Mus and Rattus, and the geomyoid genera Thomomys, Geomys, Dipodomys, and Perognathus as the most distant outgroup. The South American sigmodontines were supported as a monophyletic lineage. Within this radiation several clear-cut suprageneric groupings were identified. Many of the currently recognized tribal groupings of genera were found fairly consistently, although not always with high levels of bootstrap support. The various tribes could not be linked hierarchically with any confidence. In addition, several genera stand out as unique entities, without any apparent close relatives. The overall pattern suggests a rapid radiation of the sigmodontines in South America, followed by differentiation at the tribal and generic levels.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines different concepts of a \xe2\x80\x98warming commitment\xe2\x80\x99 which is often used in various ways to describe or imply that a certain level of warming is irrevocably committed to over time frames such as the next 50 to 100 years, or longer. We review and quantify four different concepts, namely (1) a \xe2\x80\x98constant emission warming commitment\xe2\x80\x99, (2) a \xe2\x80\x98present forcing warming commitment\xe2\x80\x99, (3) a\xe2\x80\x98zero emission (geophysical) warming commitment\xe2\x80\x99 and (4) a \xe2\x80\x98feasible scenario warming commitment\xe2\x80\x99. While a \xe2\x80\x98feasible scenario warming commitment\xe2\x80\x99 is probably the most relevant one for policy making, it depends centrally on key assumptions as to the technical, economic and political feasibility of future greenhouse gas emission reductions. This issue is of direct policy relevance when one considers that the 2002 global mean temperatures were 0.8\xc2\xb1 0.2 \xe2\x88\x98C above the pre-industrial (1861\xe2\x80\x931890) mean and the European Union has a stated goal of limiting warming to 2 \xe2\x88\x98C above the pre-industrial mean: What is the risk that we are committed to overshoot 2 \xe2\x88\x98C? Using a simple climate model (MAGICC) for probabilistic computations based on the conventional IPCC uncertainty range for climate sensitivity (1.5 to 4.5 \xe2\x88\x98C), we found that (1) a constant emission scenario is virtually certain to overshoot 2 \xe2\x88\x98C with a central estimate of 2.0 \xe2\x88\x98C by 2100 (4.2 \xe2\x88\x98C by 2400). (2) For the present radiative forcing levels it seems unlikely that 2 \xe2\x88\x98C are overshoot. (central warming estimate 1.1 \xe2\x88\x98C by 2100 and 1.2 \xe2\x88\x98C by 2400 with \xe2\x88\xbc10% probability of overshooting 2 \xe2\x88\x98C). However, the risk of overshooting is increasing rapidly if radiative forcing is stabilized much above 400 ppm CO2 equivalence (1.95 W/m2) in the long-term. (3) From a geophysical point of view, if all human-induced emissions were ceased tomorrow, it seems \xe2\x80\x98exceptionally unlikely\xe2\x80\x99 that 2 \xe2\x88\x98C will be overshoot (central estimate: 0.7 \xe2\x88\x98C by 2100; 0.4 \xe2\x88\x98C by 2400). (4) Assuming future emissions according to the lower end of published mitigation scenarios (350 ppm CO2eq to 450 ppm CO2eq) provides the central temperature projections are 1.5 to 2.1 \xe2\x88\x98C by 2100 (1.5 to 2.0 \xe2\x88\x98C by 2400) with a risk of overshooting 2 \xe2\x88\x98C between 10 and 50% by 2100 and 1\xe2\x80\x9332% in equilibrium. Furthermore, we quantify the \xe2\x80\x98avoidable warming\xe2\x80\x99 to be 0.16\xe2\x80\x930.26 \xe2\x88\x98C for every 100 GtC of avoided CO2 emissions \xe2\x80\x93 based on a range of published mitigation scenarios.'

Abstract: 'Individual and relative body size are key determinants of ecological performance, shaping the strength and types of interactions within and among species. Size-dependent performance is particularly important for iteroparous species with overlapping cohorts, determining the ability of new cohorts to invade habitats with older, larger conspecifics. We conducted two mesocosm experiments to examine the role of size and size structure in shaping growth and survival in tadpoles of the red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas), a tropical species with a prolonged breeding season. First, we used a response surface design to quantify the competitive effect and response of two tadpole size classes across three competitive environments. Large tadpoles were superior per capita effect competitors, increasing the size difference between cohorts through time at high resource availability. Hatchlings were better per biomass response competitors, and maintained the size difference between cohorts when resource availability was low. However, in contrast to previous studies, small tadpoles never closed the size gap with large tadpoles. Second, we examine the relationship between body size, size structure, and predation by dragonfly nymphs (Anax amazili) on tadpole survival and growth. Hatchlings were more vulnerable to predation; predator and large competitor presence interacted to reduce hatchling growth. Again, the size gap between cohorts increased over time, but increased marginally more with predators present. These findings have implications for understanding how variation in resources and predation over the breeding season will shape population size structure through time and the ability of new cohorts to invade habitats with older conspecifics.'

Abstract: 'The pygmy marmoset, Cebuella pygmaea, has four trill variants in its vocal repertoire. One of these trills has a different behavioral message from the other three. However, the remaining trills, which were physically different from each other, did not seem to differ in their behavioral messages.'

Abstract: 'A modified Thornthwaite Climate Classification is applied to a 32-member ensemble of CMIP5 GCMs in order to 1) evaluate model performance in the historical climate and 2) assess projected climate change at the end of the 21 s t century following two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). This classification scheme differs from the well-known K\xc3\xb6ppen approach as it uses potential evapotranspiration for thermal conditions, a moisture index for moisture conditions, and has even intervals between climate classes. The multi-model ensemble (MME) reproduces the main spatial features of the global climate reasonably well, however, in many regions the climate types are too moist. Extreme climate types, such as those found in polar and desert regions, as well as the cool- and cold-wet types of eastern North America and the warm and cool-moist types found in the southern U.S., eastern South America, central Africa and Europe are reproduced best by the MME. In contrast, the cold-dry and cold-semiarid climate types characterizing much of the high northern latitudes and the warm-wet type found in parts of Indonesia and southeast Asia are poorly represented by the MME. Regionally, most models exhibit the same sign in moisture and thermal biases, varying only in magnitude. Substantial changes in climate types are projected in both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Area coverage of torrid climate types expands by 11 % and 19 % in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projections, respectively. Furthermore, a large portion of these areas in the tropics will experience thermal conditions which exceed the range of historical values and fall into a novel super torrid climate class. The greatest growth in moisture types in climate zones is among those with dry climates (moisture index values < 0) with increased areas of more than 8 % projected by the RCP8.5 MME.'

Abstract: 'We quantified the within-population genetic variation of Couratari multiflora and C. guianensis, two tree species found in terra firme forests of central Amazonia. Both species have some ecological features in common, but they differ in population abundance across their geographic ranges. While C. multiflora has been found only in low-density populations in all sites studied to date, C. guianensis is relatively common in some sites and very scarce in others. In a 400-ha plot, we found 41 and 29 adults of C. multiflora and C. guianensis, respectively. Twenty-two saplings of C. guianensis and 103 seedlings of C. multiflora were also examined. The mean expected heterozygosities (Hem) of seedlings and adults of C. multiflora were 0.431 and 0.436, and the mean fixation indices (Fm), 0.114 and 0.176, respectively. For C. guianensis, saplings and adults presented Hem equal to 0.425 and 0.429, and the Fm were 0.393 and 0.527, respectively. These low-density populations of two congeneric species did not differ in terms of genetic diversity, but rather they differed in terms of mean observed heterozygosity (Hom), and therefore Fm. The species with variable population density had lower Hom and greater Fm relative to the species that is always found in low-density.'

Abstract: 'Because plants convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in organisms, biomass production as an energy source can help to reduce the world\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on fossil energy and mitigate global warming. Biofuel production is a fast-growing industry that represents a new type of large-scale human disturbance on ecosystems. Thus, the benefits of biofuel production bring environmental risks that include its potential impact on biodiversity, which is still an open question. In this review, we start first with a brief overview of the evolution of biofuel concept; second, we review the state of biofuel production across the continents, with a major emphasis on the main species used and their major feedstock. For which, we found significant differences for land use and environmental cultural management of biofuel plantation between tropical and temperate regions. Third, we summarize the impacts of biofuel plantation on biodiversity at multiple scales, based on the case studied with respect to the corresponding issues. At the genetic level, introgression and contamination by aggressive genotypes are a primary risk. At the species level, habitat pollution, degradation, and disturbance caused by intensive management of biofuel plantation significantly raise the risk of habitat fragmentation, native extinction, and bio-invasion. At the ecosystem level, the large-scale homogeneous landscape of biofuel plantation results in simplified community and food web that severely damage ecosystem services, including ecosystem diversity. Finally, we compare the current and potential benefits and risks of biofuel plantations for the practical application of a biofuel industry of China. We emphasize the land use constraint from food security and biodiversity conservation, and the need for scientific research and systematic monitoring as a critical support for the sustainable development of biofuel production in China.'

Abstract: 'The genus Acrocomia, popularly known as macaw palm or maca\xc3\xbaba, occurs in savanna areas and open forests of tropical America, with distribution from Central to southern South America. They are important oleaginous palm trees, due to their role in ecosystems and local economies and their potential for biofuel production and vegetable oil. Although the taxonomy of the genus is not resolved because of observed phenotypic diversity in A. aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart., there are several conflicting treatments. Some authors recognize three caulescent spp. occurring in South America: A. aculeata, A. intumescens Drude, and A. totai Mart, although a new one was described recently\xe2\x80\x94Acrocomia corumbaensis. Because some Latin American governments want to expand production of macaw palm in their territory as raw material for agro-energy, several groups have been encouraged to study this genus, focusing on the production of biodiesel, seed germination, phenotypic aspects, and genetic diversity. The goal of this review is to compile key information available in the literature and herbarium data, focusing on South American populations of the genus.'

Abstract: 'There are knowledge gaps in our understanding of vegetation responses to multi-scale climate-related variables in tropical/subtropical mountainous islands in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, this study investigated inter-annual vegetation dynamics and regular/irregular climate patterns in Taiwan. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) on 11 years (2001\xe2\x88\xbc2011) of high-dimensional monthly photosynthetically active vegetation cover (PV) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and investigated the relationships between spatiotemporal patterns of the eigenvectors and loadings of each component through time and multi-scale climaterelated variations. Results showed that the first five components contributed to 96.4% of the total variance. The first component (PC1, explaining 94.5% of variance) loadings, as expected, were significantly correlated with the temporal dynamics of the PV (r = 0.94), which was mainly governed by regional climate. The temporal loadings of PC2 and PC3 (0.8% and 0.6% of variance, respectively) were significantly correlated with the temporal dynamics of the PV of forests (r = 0.72) and the farmlands (r = 0.80), respectively. The low-order components (PC4 and PC5, 0.3% and 0.2% of variance, respectively) were closely related to the occurrence of drought (r = 0.49) and to irregular ENSO associated climate anomalies (r = \xe2\x88\x920.54), respectively. Pronounced correlations were also observed between PC5 and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) with one to three months of time lags (r = \xe2\x88\x920.35 \xe2\x88\xbc \xe2\x88\x920.43, respectively), revealing biophysical memory effects on the time-series pattern of the vegetation through ENSO-related rainfall patterns. Our findings reveal that the sensitivity of the ecosystems in this tropical/subtropical mountainous island may not only be regulated by regional climate and human activities but also be susceptible to large-scale climate anomalies which are crucial and comparable to previous large scale analyses. This study demonstrates that PCA can be an effective tool for analyzing seasonal and inter-annual variability of vegetation dynamics across this tropical/subtropical mountainous islandin the Pacific Ocean, which provides an opportunity to forecast the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial environments to future climate scenarios.'

Abstract: 'Biotic and abiotic factors such as resource availability and rainfall may exert influence on the life cycle of several organisms. In this study, we investigated correlations between the phenology of hawkmoths, flowering phenology of Inga Mill. species (Fabaceae\xe2\x80\x93Mimosoideae\xe2\x80\x93Ingeae) and rainfall in one of the largest remnants of Atlantic forest in northeastern Brazil (Coimbra forest with ca. 3500\xc2\xa0ha). We carried out monthly hawkmoth inventories and phenological observations of the five most abundant Inga species in Coimbra forest from October 2005 to August 2007. Altogether 39 hawkmoth individuals were collected with light trap or butterfly net, which were ascribed to nine genera and 14 species. With the present study Pachygonidia caliginosa Boisduval (Bombycoidea\xe2\x80\x93Sphingidae\xe2\x80\x93Dilophonotina) is registered for the second time in Brazil, since the species had been previously collected only in the Amazon. The tribe Dilophonotina was the most represented with five species. Animals with short proboscises (14.7\xe2\x80\x9335.0\xc2\xa0mm) represented over 69.7% of the sample. Most individuals were collected during the months of low rainfall, the same period of the highest flower abundance of five Inga species. The flowering of Inga vera, I. striata and I. ingoides was positively correlated with hawkmoth abundance. The synchrony of the activity period of these animals in adult phase with certain nectar sources, and the relationship between morphological parameters of hawkmoths and Inga flowers suggest a narrow pollination mutualistic relationship at the study site. Considering the hotspot status of the Atlantic forest due to high fragmentation and habitat loss, as well as the previous local extinction of hawkmoth species in smaller fragments of the studied landscape, our results are relevant for restoration plans not only for the Brazilian Atlantic forest, but for neotropical forests in general, where Inga is native.'

Abstract: 'Muscodor yucatanensis, an endophytic fungus, was isolated from the leaves of Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae) in a dry, semideciduous tropical forest in the Ecological Reserve El Eden, Quintana Roo, Mexico. We tested the mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by M. yucatanensis for allelochemical effects against other endophytic fungi, phytopathogenic fungi and fungoids, and plants. VOCs were lethal to Guignardia mangifera, Colletotrichum sp., Phomopsis sp., Alternaria solani, Rhizoctonia sp., Phytophthora capsici, and P. parasitica, but had no effect on Fusarium oxysporum, Xylaria sp., the endophytic isolate 120, or M. yucatanensis. VOCs inhibited root elongation in amaranth, tomato, and barnyard grass, particularly those produced during the first 15\xc2\xa0days of fungal growth. VOCs were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and included compounds not previously reported from other Muscodor species and the previously reported compounds octane, 2-methyl butyl acetate, 2-pentyl furan, caryophyllene, and aromadendrene. We also evaluated organic extracts from the culture medium and mycelium of M. yucatanensis on the same endophytes, phytopathogens, and plants. In general, extracts inhibited plants more than endophytic or phytopathogens fungi. G. mangifera was the only organism that was significantly stimulated by both extracts regardless of concentration. Compounds in both organic extracts were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We discuss the possible allelopathic role that metabolites of M. yucatanensis play in its ecological interactions with its host plant and other organisms.'

Abstract: 'The present study was undertaken in moist temperate forest of Mandal-Chopta area in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India. The aim of the present study was to understand the regeneration dynamics of the dominant tree species along an altitudinal gradient in naturally regenerating, restricted access forest. The overall regeneration status was fairly high in the study area. Most of the native canopy and undercanopy dominants had frequent reproduction and expanding populations, which suggests the stability of forest structure/composition and further expansion of dominant species. The overall regeneration of trees in the forest had a greater contribution of middle and understorey species. Because of infrequent reproduction and declining populations of some of the dominant native species viz., Abies pindrow, Alnus nepalensis and Betula alnoides, structural/compositional changes in the future are expected in respective forests dominated by them. Abies pindrow and Taxus baccata need immediate attention by forest managers for their survival in the area. Seedlings were found to be more prone to competition from herb and shrubs than saplings.'

Abstract: 'Andean South America, including the adjacent lowland environments, can be evaluated in reference to the patterns and processes that characterize plant diversity, evolution, and distribution. Although its ecological complexity is bewildering and the evolutionary and geological history is convoluted and poorly understood, progress can be made by testing the relationship of known processes and paleoevents to patterns of diversification and distribution.'

Abstract: "We investigated the natural abundance of 15N in sun leaves and other components of tropical rain forests on altitudinal sequences of eight sites that form a gradient of soil N availability with varying ectomycorrhizal abundances on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. We investigated how soil N availability and ectomycorrhizal abundance related to the 15N abundance of ecosystem components. \xce\xb415N values (15N abundance relative to 14N) increased consistently in the following order at each site: sun leaves, leaf litter, fine roots and from shallower organic to deeper mineral soil horizons. Enrichment (3\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\xb0 \xce\xb415N) of 15N occurred at the litter\xe2\x80\x93topsoil interface at all sites, and the magnitude of the enrichment correlated negatively with 15N depletion in the foliage, irrespective of ectomycorrhizal abundance. Foliar \xce\xb415N values significantly positively correlated with their N concentrations. Foliar (and litter and root) \xce\xb415N values correlated positively with NO3 availability, and negatively with NH4 availability. The two positive correlations of foliar \xce\xb415N with foliar N and NO3 availability were inconsistent with the assumption that stronger nitrification (hence a greater nitrate availability) produced a more 15N-depleted active inorganic N pool. The isotopic fractionation during the passage of N through ectomycorrhizas to plants might explain the positive correlation of foliar \xce\xb415N and N concentration; however, this mechanism could not fully explain the correlation in our case because strong foliar 15N depletions occurred at the sites that lacked ectomycorrhizas. Alternatively, the positive correlation across sites reflected the tightness of N cycling. Strong nitrification and associated isotopic fractionation might have occurred at N-richer sites and the subsequent removal of NO3 from the system could decrease isotopically `lighter' N at these sites."

Abstract: 'A lack of appropriate proxies has traditionally hampered our ability to distinguish riverine organic carbon (OC) sources at the landscape scale. However, the dissection of C4 grasslands by C3-enriched riparian vegetation, and the distinct carbon stable isotope signature (\xce\xb413C) of these two photosynthetic pathways, provides a unique setting to assess the relative contribution of riparian and more distant sources to riverine C pools. Here, we compared \xce\xb413C signatures of bulk sub-basin vegetation (\xce\xb413CVEG) with those of riverine OC pools for a wide range of sites within two contrasting river basins in Madagascar. Although C3-derived carbon dominated in the eastern Rianala catchment, consistent with the dominant vegetation, we found that in the C4-dominated Betsiboka basin, riverine OC is disproportionately sourced from the C3-enriched riparian fringe, irrespective of climatic season, even though \xce\xb413CVEG estimates suggest as much as 96% of vegetation cover in some Betsiboka sub-basins may be accounted for by C4 biomass. For example, \xce\xb413C values for river bed OC were on average 6.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.7\xe2\x80\xb0 depleted in 13C compared to paired estimates of \xce\xb413CVEG. The disconnection of the wider C4-dominated basin is considered the primary driver of the under-representation of C4-derived C within riverine OC pools in the Betsiboka basin, although combustion of grassland biomass by fire is likely a subsidiary constraint on the quantity of terrestrial organic matter available for export to these streams and rivers. Our findings carry implications for the use of sedimentary \xce\xb413C signatures as proxies for past forest-grassland distribution and climate, as the C4 component may be considerably underestimated due to its disconnection from riverine OC pools.'

Abstract: 'Medicinal plants are essential in the medical systems of the Mixe and Zapotec. In this study ethno-ecological strategies, employed by the two neighboring Indian groups in Mexico, for obtaining medicinal plants are analyzed. The indigenous classification of the environment is notably different from the Western one and distinguishes six dissimilar principal \xe2\x80\x9czones\xe2\x80\x9d or land use types. Most ethnomedically important species are cultivated in the \xe2\x80\x9chouse garden\xe2\x80\x9d or gathered in the community or its immediate surroundings. The house garden, for example, contributes 31.8% and 26.2% of all medical taxa for the Mixe and Zapotec, respectively. These ethnobotanical data on the indigenous uses indicate that anthropogenic types of vegetation yield the largest percentage of medicinal taxa.'

Abstract: 'A new Earth system model, GENIE-1, is presented which comprises a 3-D frictional geostrophic ocean, phosphate-restoring marine biogeochemistry, dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice, land surface physics and carbon cycling, and a seasonal 2-D energy-moisture balance atmosphere. Three sets of model climate parameters are used to explore the robustness of the results and for traceability to earlier work. The model versions have climate sensitivity of 2.8\xe2\x80\x933.3\xc2\xb0C and predict atmospheric CO2 close to present observations. Six idealized total fossil fuel CO2 emissions scenarios are used to explore a range of 1,100\xe2\x80\x9315,000 GtC total emissions and the effect of rate of emissions. Atmospheric CO2 approaches equilibrium in year 3000\xc2\xa0at 420\xe2\x80\x935,660\xc2\xa0ppmv, giving 1.5\xe2\x80\x9312.5\xc2\xb0C global warming. The ocean is a robust carbon sink of up to 6.5\xc2\xa0GtC\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. Under \xe2\x80\x98business as usual\xe2\x80\x99, the land becomes a carbon source around year 2100 which peaks at up to 2.5\xc2\xa0GtC\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. Soil carbon is lost globally, boreal vegetation generally increases, whilst under extreme forcing, dieback of some tropical and sub-tropical vegetation occurs. Average ocean surface pH drops by up to 1.15 units. A Greenland ice sheet melt threshold of 2.6\xc2\xb0C local warming is only briefly exceeded if total emissions are limited to 1,100\xc2\xa0GtC, whilst 15,000\xc2\xa0GtC emissions cause complete Greenland melt by year 3000, contributing 7\xc2\xa0m to sea level rise. Total sea-level rise, including thermal expansion, is 0.4\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0m in year 3000 and ongoing. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation shuts down in two out of three model versions, but only under extreme emissions including exotic fossil fuel resources.'

Abstract: 'An increasing knowledge of the global risk of malaria shows that the nations of the Americas have the lowest levels of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax endemicity worldwide, sustained, in part, by substantive integrated vector control. To help maintain and better target these efforts, knowledge of the contemporary distribution of each of the dominant vector species (DVS) of human malaria is needed, alongside a comprehensive understanding of the ecology and behaviour of each species.'

Abstract: "The biodiversity of forested regions today is the result of complex historical interactions among physical, biological, and social forces over time, often heavily influenced by cycles of various sorts. Fire, agriculture technology, and trade have been particularly powerful human influences on forests. Virtually all of our planet's forests have been affected by the cultural patterns of human use, and the resulting landscape is an ever-changing mosaic of unmanaged and managed patches of habitat, which vary in size, shape, and arrangement. Because chance factors, human influence and small climatic variation can cause very substantial changes in vegetation, the biodiversity for any given landscape will vary substantially over any significant time period- and no one variant is necessarily more \xe2\x80\x98natural\xe2\x80\x99 than the others. This implies that biodiversity conservation efforts may need to give greater attention to ecosystem processes than to ecosystem products. A review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to over-exploit their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society. It appears that the best way to maintain biodiversity in forest ecosystems in the late 20th Century is through a combination of strictly protected areas (carefully selected on the basis of clearly defined criteria), multiple-use areas managed by local people, natural forests extensively managed for sustainable yield of logs and other products and services, and forest plantations intensively managed for the wood products needed by society. This diversity of approaches and uses will provide humanity with the widest range of options, the greatest diversity of opportunities, for adapting to the cyclical changes which are certain to continue."

Abstract: 'Wetlands cover large areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, their extent and distribution have not been accurately mapped. While wetland forests remain largely undisturbed, increasing threats by anthropogenic activities have been observed in areas with high population density per arable or exploitable land. The scarcity of terra firma forests in some territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has forced local communities to develop cropping methods that allow for cultivation in periodically flooded areas. Assessing wetlands extent and status is critical for long term conservation of these highly vulnerable ecosystems. In this study, we use multi-source and multi-resolution optical and radar remotely sensed data and elevation derived indices to map the wetlands of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Results showed that wetlands are a significant part of the landscape in the country, covering an estimated 440,000\xc2\xa0km2 or 19.2\xc2\xa0% of the total country area. By combining the wetlands map with a previously produced land cover depiction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a map including forested wetlands as a thematic class was derived. We investigated whether high terra firma population density and low percent remaining terra firma forest are related at the lowest administrative level (Sector); specifically, we tested these two variables as predictors of wetland forest cover loss. A polynomial regression relating population and primary terra firma forest to wetland forest cover loss yielded an r  2  of 0.76, illustrating a nascent and significant land cover change dynamic. Areas most at risk for future wetland forest loss lie in the western Cuvette, and include (north\xe2\x80\x93south) the Sud-Ubangi, Mongala, Equateur and Mai-Ndombe Districts. By quantifying available upland forest resources and overlaying with population density, it was possible to identify stressed areas inside of the forest domain (traditionally known for having generically high levels of forest resources). Results illustrate the need for addressing issues of wetland forest management and protection in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially where increasing populations are exhausting primary terra firma forest resources.'

Abstract: 'The RSPO and RTRS are global private partnerships that have been set up by business and civil society actors from the North to curb de-forestation and to promote sustainable production of palm oil or soy in the South. This article is about the launch of new national standards in Indonesia and Brazil that are look-alikes of the global standards but have been set up and supported by government or business actors from the South. The two main questions of this article are: do the new national standards in Indonesia and Brazil provide a fundamental challenge to the RSPO and RTRS, or do they demonstrate the successful diffusion and adoption of global private rules into national contexts? Do the new national standards help or undermine the RSPO and RTRS in their efforts to reduce de-forestation? Combining the theoretical notions of proto-institution and rival governance network, a comparative analysis is offered of the launch of the new national standards in Indonesia and Brazil. The conclusion is that, whilst the RSPO and RTRS have served as models for the general design and principles of the national standards, they really differ from the global standards in terms of normative contents: the national standards offer more room to palm oil plantations and large-scale soy producers to expand production at the expense of forests and other high conservation areas. Governments and producer associations in Indonesia and Brazil have not launched national standards to implement the RSPO or RTRS but to challenge these interventions from the North.'

Abstract: 'Large disturbances such as fires and floods are landscape processes that may alter the structure of landscapes in nature reserves. Landscape structure may in turn influence the viability of species and the functioning of ecosystems. Past reserve design and management strategies have been focussed on species and ecosystems rather than on landscape-scale processes, such as disturbance.'

Abstract: 'A rainfall-induced compound disaster happened in Mocoa in the pre-dawn hours of 1 April 2017. More than 300 people were killed, and a large number of houses and roads were destroyed in the worst catastrophe in the history of Mocoa. To investigate this disaster, a detailed interpretation was carried out using high-resolution images. Analysis of disaster characteristics based on satellite image revealed that the disaster could be identified as a consequence of compound mountain hazards including landslides, debris flows, and mountain torrents. The mountain hazards converged in the mountain watershed, which amplified the disaster\xe2\x80\x99s effects. Analysis considers that this disaster is the result of heavy rainfalls. Moreover, in-depth interpretation of rainfall data and satellite images spanning over 16\xc2\xa0years reveals that the previous El Ni\xc3\xb1o event (2014\xe2\x80\x932016) also played an important role, which caused reduced rainfall and vegetation coverage. The long period of drought brought by El Ni\xc3\xb1o affected the growth of vegetation and reduced the ability of vegetation to cope with heavy rainfalls. The results reveal that both antecedent rainfalls and climate impact need to be taken into consideration for mountain hazard analysis.'

Abstract: 'Migrating animals face numerous mortality risks, such as novel predators with which they may not be accustomed. Most animals can recognize predators innately; however, additional predator information can be collected to enhance familiarity. Because migrating birds rarely participate in mobs, they may seek alternative information sources such as cues provided by other birds that can provide information on predator location, identity, and degree of threat. We predicted that Nearctic\xe2\x80\x93Neotropical migrants (hereafter, \xe2\x80\x9cmigrants\xe2\x80\x9d) would react to vocal antipredator cues (e.g., mob-calls) of species residing in areas through which they migrate. To test this, we conducted experiments in Belize during spring migration, using playbacks of mob-calls of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) and blue-gray tanagers (Thraupis episcopus); tanagers are familiar to all birds in Belize; chickadees are novel to residents but familiar to migrants. This also allowed us to assess response to novel and out-of-context antipredator signals. Resident birds did not respond to novel chickadee mob-calls, but did respond to familiar tanager calls. Birds overwintering south of our study area, which were migrating during our study, responded most strongly to chickadee playbacks. Conversely, individuals of species that include our study area in their winter range did not respond to either playback. This is the first evidence that birds react to vocal antipredator cues during migration, which may be a strategy used by migrants to learn about predators. Although residents failed to recognize a foreign cue, migrating birds responded most strongly to the out-of-context chickadee cue, associated with breeding grounds >2,000\xc2\xa0km northward.'

Abstract: 'Studies of Atlantic forest (AF) organisms suggest that the historical dynamics of the forest cover produced demographically stable populations in its central region and unstable populations in the southern regions. We studied the mitochondrial phylogeographic structure of an AF passerine, the Greenish Schiffornis Schiffornis virescens (Tityridae), and evaluated questions related to the history of the AF. We analyzed cytochrome b and control region sequences of the mitochondrial genome by traditional phylogenetic and population genetic methods based on summary statistics. In addition, we used coalescent simulations to evaluate specific models of evolution of the populations of S. virescens. The results did not support phylogeographic partitions of the genetic variability of S. virescens. The overall \xce\xa6st was\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.32 and gene flow between regions was moderate to high. The analyses suggested that the total population of S. virescens suffered a bottleneck followed by a demographic expansion in the late Pleistocene. The bottleneck might have contributed to the extinction of intraspecific lineages, and hence to the observed lack of a strong phylogeographic pattern and low genetic diversity. Our results suggest that some AF taxa have had all their populations similarly affected by the recent history of the biome, contrary to what has been revealed from most of the other phylogeographic studies in the region and as suggested by a model of AF refuges (the Carnaval\xe2\x80\x93Moritz model). We suggest that the response of organisms to common histories may be idiosyncratic, and predictions about the history of the biome should take into account ecological characteristics and distribution of each specific taxa.'

Abstract: 'Nearly 40% of the remaining Atlantic Forest in southern Bahia state, Brazil, is a rustic agroforest of cacao (Theobroma cacao). These traditional shade plantations, locally known as \xe2\x80\x98cabrucas\xe2\x80\x99, are habitats for forest dwelling species. Here we investigated the potential role of this traditional crop as a support for bat assemblages in southern Bahia, establishing the extent to which the bat community structure found in this agricultural system is influenced by the proximity of forest tracts. We compared the bat community attributes (richness, diversity and dominance) and species-level response (capture frequency) between native forest tracts and shade cacao plantations located in two distinct landscapes, which varied in total amount of forest (patch sizes and total forested area) and in their proximity to forest tracts. The cabrucas contiguous to forest tracts showed a rich and abundant bat community, with samples showing capture rates, species richness, diversity and evenness significantly higher than those reported for forest tracts. This situation changes, however, when shade plantations are located at some distance from forest tracts ( > 1000\xc2\xa0m). Bat communities in these isolated cabrucas are less diverse than those found in forests and nearby cabrucas, but in both cases, species usually associated with pristine habitats were found. These findings suggest that cabrucas per se are not forest surrogates, and their potential to harbor forest dwelling bat species is closely linked with the existence of nearby forest tracts that may act as a source for species populations. Therefore, the entire landscape should be considered for management, taking into account that maintenance of cabrucas together with the preservation and restoration of forest patches is probably direly needed if one wishes to conserve the bat diversity in southern Bahia for the long term.'

Abstract: 'Local ecological knowledge (LEK) has been discussed in terms of its similarities to and its potential to complement normative scientific knowledge. In this study, we compared the knowledge of a Brazilian quilombola population regarding the habitat use and life habits of large mammals with in situ recordings of the species. We also tested the hypothesis that quilombola LEK has a special focus on the anthropogenic portion of the landscape.'

Abstract: 'Vegetation structure and species composition of tropical ecosystems were studied through nine transects at Veerapuli and Kalamalai reserve forests in the Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. Species diversity, dominance, species richness and evenness indices of plant communities and also population structure of woody plants were enumerated. A total of 244 species (183 genera and 76 families) were recorded. Species richness (number of species) were 82,142 and 96 species per 0.3 ha respectively for the study areas of low-elevation forest (LEF), mid-elevation forest (MEF) and high elevation forest (HEF). Species diversity indices were greater in MEF compared to the other two forests except juveniles. In contrast, greater dominance value indices were recorded in LEF than other forests. Density and basal area of the MEF were twice greater than the LEF, while HEF showed greater tree density and low basal area when compared to LEF. The stem density and species richness (number of species) decreased with increased size classes of trees observed in the present study indicated good regeneration status. Population structure of juveniles and seedlings also reflects good regeneration status. Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 99.9) and Hopea parviflora (IVI of 103.8) were dominant tree species respectively in LEF and MEF whereas in HEF Agrostistachys meeboldii (63.65), Cullenia excelsa (63.67) and Drypetes oblongifolia (39.67) share the dominance. Past damage (anthropogenic perturbation) may be one of the reasons for single species dominance in LEF and MEF. Occurrence of alien species such as Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conyzoides also indicated the past disturbance in LEF. The variations in plant diversity and population structure are largely due to anthropogenic perturbation and other abiotic factors.'

Abstract: 'We examined recruitment of trees whose seeds are dispersed by black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) in forest fragments within the Community Baboon Sanctuary in north-central Belize. In the fragments, most other large frugivores are absent and howlers dominate the large frugivore community. Consequently, we expected to observe an increased representation of howler fruit trees among the sapling community. To test this prediction preliminarily we observed howler feeding behavior for one year and conducted adult tree and sapling transects in 6 locations where howlers were present. We sampled a seventh site where howlers were absent for vegetation only. We found that in 4 of 6 sites there were proportionately fewer howler fruit saplings when compared to adult tree samples. However, when recruitment of howler fruit trees in the 6 sites was compared to a site where howlers were absent, 11 of 12 species had relatively higher recruitment. The lack of recruitment among howler fruit trees in general likely reflects differences in responses of individual species, as well as disruptions from human activities to natural processes within the forests. The observed lower recruitment patterns of howler trees suggest that over time, the abundance of the trees will likely decline and thus affect the foraging behavior and possibly survival of howlers in the fragmented forests.'

Abstract: 'The complex paleobotanical investigations carried out in the Maoming sedimentary basin (Guangdong Province, South China) yielded first data on the taxonomic composition and ecological properties of two large paleofloras from the Youganwo and Huangniuling formations. The palynomorph assemblages from these formations indicate their middle-late Eocene age (Lutetian-Bartonian and Priabonian for the former and latter, respectively). It is shown that sediments of the Youganwo Formation were deposited in an intermittently swamped lacustrine-fluvial plain, which gave way to a freshwater lake. Vegetation of this period was represented by wet subtropical forests with evergreen Fagaceae, Lauraceae, and Palmae. The Huangniuling flora reflects the biome of seasonal tropical forests developed in a broad fluvial plain and its margins. The Eocene floras of the Maoming Basin are marked by the appearance of several recent plant genera, which is also evident from finds of remains of their reproductive structures. The Eocene flora from low latitudes of South China exhibits a notable share of floral elements from middle and high latitudes of East Asia.'

Abstract: 'A recent debate has contrasted two conservation strategies in agricultural landscapes; either \xe2\x80\x9cland sparing\xe2\x80\x9d farm development combining intensive production practices with forest set-asides, or \xe2\x80\x9cwildlife-friendly\xe2\x80\x9d farming with greater on-farm habitat value but lower yields. We argue that in established mosaic landscapes including old cacao production regions where natural forest has already been reduced to relatively small fragments, a combination of both strategies is needed to conserve biodiversity. After reviewing the evidence for the insufficiency of either strategy alone if applied to such landscapes, the paper focuses on the cacao production landscape of southern Bahia, Brazil, once the world\xe2\x80\x99s second largest cacao producer. Here, small remaining areas of Atlantic Forest are embedded in a matrix dominated by traditional cacao agroforests, resulting in a landscape mosaic that has proven favorable to the conservation of the region\xe2\x80\x99s high biodiversity. We show that current land use dynamics and public policies pose threats but also offer opportunities to conservation and describe a three-pronged landscape conservation strategy, consisting of (i) expansion of the protected areas system, (ii) promotion of productive yet biodiversity-friendly cacao farming practices, and (iii) assistance to land users to implement legally mandated on-farm reserves and voluntary private reserves. We discuss recent experiences concerning the implementation of this strategy, discuss likely future scenarios, and reflect on the applicability of the Bahian experience to biodiversity rich cacao production regions elsewhere in the tropics.'

Abstract: 'It has recently been argued that hunter-gatherers do not, did not, and could not live in tropical rain forest without some access to agricultural produce. This opinion challenges models of past non-agricultural subsistence patterns that are based in analogies derived from modern rain forest dwelling groups. In this paper, the socio-ecological bases of the hunting system of the Kubo people of lowland Papua New Guinea are described. It is argued that this system lacks necessary dependence upon the agricultural system with which it co-occurs and, in fact, can be connected with a system of carbohydrate procurement that is not agricultural. The hypothesized connection provides the basis of a model of non-agricultural subsistence in lowland tropical rain forest.'

Abstract: "The literature on climate change from an enhanced greenhouse effect is large and growing rapidly. The problems considered are increasingly inter-disciplinary. For these reasons many workers will find useful pointers to the literature in the fields interacting with, but outside of, their own. We present here an annotated bibliography on issues relating to changes in the concentrations of Earth's greenhouse gases. The areas covered include theory and numerical modelling of climate change; cycles involving carbon dioxide and other radiatively important trace gases; observations of climate change and the problems associated with those observations; paleoclimatology as it relates to previous changes in the greenhouse gases; the impacts on and interactions with managed and natural ecosystems from climate change; policy issues related to climate change and to the limitation of climate change; history of the study of the greenhouse effect; and some other causes of climate change. Selection of papers has been made to facilitate rapid introduction to most of the important issues and findings in an area. Over 600 articles, reports, and books are discussed."

Abstract: 'Maps have been established as objects bestowed with knowledge, power and impact. In the hands of people, maps have been a form of political counter-power. The emergence of digital cartography, mobile media, data crowdsourcing platforms and geographic information systems strengthens the maps\xe2\x80\x99 muscle and coincides with a growing interest in crisis and activist mapping, a practice that blends the capabilities of the geoweb with humanitarian assistance and campaigning. Based on empirical observation, case studies and interviews, this article analyses the emergence of digital cartography as a new paradigm in activism and humanitarianism by examining how two platforms\xe2\x80\x94Ushahidi and InfoAmazonia\xe2\x80\x94use maps. Ushahidi was created in 2008 in Kenya, marking the beginning of geoactivism, which employs digital cartography and often crowdsourced data to provide alternative narratives and spaces for communication and action. InfoAmazonia\xe2\x80\x94dedicated to environmental issues and human rights in the Amazon region\xe2\x80\x94was created in 2012. Since then, other geoactivist initiatives proliferated, presenting three different outcomes in the shape of a paradigm shift, several disruptions and criticism. This study examines these consequences, scrutinising how humanitarianism and activism\xe2\x80\x94as fields of power and knowledge\xe2\x80\x94are being reconfigured by new cartographic practices.'

Abstract: "This article examines knowledge of medicinal plants, both among the people of Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast and among the scientific community. Data collected during an 809-household, five-community survey in 1990 and a ten-community botanical collection in 1991 are used to estimate the distribution of medicinal plant knowledge among the region's six ethnic groups. The list of 162 plants identified during this project is compared with other research results to provide the reader with a framework for understanding the distribution of medicinal plant knowledge."

Abstract: 'An ethnobotanical inventory of lianas was carried out in a 1-ha plot of tropical moist forest in the Cuyabeno Reserve, Amazonian Ecuador. We obtained information about the uses that the Siona-Secoya Indians have for lianas. Of 98 species in the 1-ha plot, 47% were useful for the Siona-Secoya. Of the species used, 67% were for medicines, food, stimulants, and poisons; 17% had ritual applications, and 15% were used to make ropes or to weave baskets, toys, and ornaments. The species of lianas that were most useful were the ones with the highest values of ecological parameters such as density, dominance, and relative length. There is a close relationship between the ecological characteristics of the liana community and the uses made of it by the Indians.'

Abstract: 'This paper develops a framework for the valuation and management of tropical forests that reflects their ecological and economic characteristics. The analysis demonstrates the importance of modeling the feasible use patterns and the information structure in tropical forest management decisions. The model predicts that cases exist where the foresighted management of forests leads to more preservation than the traditional expected value approach. An application in Thailand provides evidence that such cases occur in relevant ranges of benefit flows. The model focuses tropical forest management on assessments of sustainability and feasible sequences in light of uncertainty and information flows.'

Abstract: 'A survey of nodulation was carried out in seven regions of Brazil and the nodulation status of 131 legume species is reported. Nodulation is reported for the first time in 46 species and six genera, representing 35% of the examined species. Two of the genera were non-nodulating: Martiodendron and Nissolia, and four nodulating: Riedeliella, Bergeronia, Goldmania. Moreover the last tribe of Mimosoideae yet to be examined for nodulation Mimoziganthus, was shown to be nodulated. The nodulation pattern is discussed in the light of the taxonomy of the family.'

Abstract: 'While tourism\xe2\x80\x99s positive contributions to societies have long been debated, commerce based tourism activities can strengthen peaceful societies by adhering to sustainable tourism principles. This study utilizes content analysis to examine 136 tourism practices from four major awards programs for their contributions to sustainability and peace. Specific practices which illuminate each of these contributions are highlighted. The findings reveal the most common initiatives focus on environmental quality, economic development, and community nourishment efforts, with substantially less focus on initiatives to engage citizen diplomacy and increase transparency. The use of awards programs to further sustainable tourism is discussed, and suggestions for future research in this important area of study are shared.'

Abstract: 'The climate of the last glacial maximum (LGM) is simulated with a high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model, the NCAR CCM3 at spectral truncation of T170, corresponding to a grid cell size of roughly 75\xc2\xa0km. The purpose of the study is to assess whether there are significant benefits from the higher resolution simulation compared to the lower resolution simulation associated with the role of topography. The LGM simulations were forced with modified CLIMAP sea ice distribution and sea surface temperatures (SST) reduced by 1\xc2\xb0C, ice sheet topography, reduced CO2, and 21,000 BP orbital parameters. The high-resolution model captures modern climate reasonably well, in particular the distribution of heavy precipitation in the tropical Pacific. For the ice age case, surface temperature simulated by the high-resolution model agrees better with those of proxy estimates than does the low-resolution model. Despite the fact that tropical SSTs were only 2.1\xc2\xb0C less than the control run, there are many lowland tropical land areas 4\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xb0C colder than present. Comparison of T170 model results with the best constrained proxy temperature estimates (noble gas concentrations in groundwater) now yield no significant differences between model and observations. There are also significant upland temperature changes in the best resolved tropical mountain belt (the Andes). We provisionally attribute this result in part as resulting from decreased lateral mixing between ocean and land in a model with more model grid cells. A longstanding model-data discrepancy therefore appears to be resolved without invoking any unusual model physics. The response of the Asian summer monsoon can also be more clearly linked to local geography in the high-resolution model than in the low-resolution model; this distinction should enable more confident validation of climate proxy data with the high-resolution model. Elsewhere, an inferred salinity increase in the subtropical North Atlantic may have significant implications for ocean circulation changes during the LGM. A large part of the Amazon and Congo Basins are simulated to be substantially drier in the ice age\xe2\x80\x94consistent with many (but not all) paleo data. These results suggest that there are considerable benefits derived from high-resolution model regarding regional climate responses, and that observationalists can now compare their results with models that resolve geography at a resolution comparable to that which the proxy data represent.'

Abstract: 'The executive and legislative branches of Brazilian government have either proposed or taken a variety of initiatives that threaten biodiversity and ecosystems. Opposition by the scientific community has largely been ignored by decision-makers. In this short essay, we present recent examples of harmful policies that have great potential to erode biodiversity, and we suggest ways to communicate scientific knowledge to decision- makers. If the current gap between conservation science and policies is not filled, the country will threaten the maintenance of its natural capital and, consequently, the sustainability of essential societal activities in the long term.'

Abstract: 'Despite the fact that business people and business students often cast doubt on the relevance of universal moral principles in business, the rejection of relativism is a precondition for business ethics to get off the ground. This paper proposes an educational strategy to overcome the philosophical confusions about relativism in which business people and students are often trapped. First, the paper provides some conceptual distinctions and clarifications related to moral relativism, particularism, and virtue ethics. More particularly, it revisits arguments demonstrating that virtues in business are not in contradiction with the relevance of universal principles, despite the fact that virtue ethics is often identified with particular relationships and contexts. It goes on to show how students and managers, but also researchers, often mix up radically different conceptions of moral relativism. It is also argued that this confusion is in part created by the cross-cultural management literature in which the methodological stance of the value-freedom of the social sciences is, in a perplexingly mistaken way, transformed into a rejection of all normative discussion and a plea for relativism. The remainder of the paper presents some tools that may be helpful in steering people toward less simplistic views about moral relativism and virtue ethics. It further argues that it is equally important to spell out that moral universalism can be understood in a humble way, without implying either arrogant ethnocentrism or omniscience, as part of an ongoing debate that progresses gradually.'

Abstract: 'We present a descriptive case study of Terrascope, an innovative, year-long, project-based learning community at MIT. Each year, Terrascope students study a particular environmental or Earth-system problem from a multidisciplinary perspective. Terrascope includes both academic and non-academic components; this paper focuses on the academic components. The objectives of the academic subjects, and of the program as a whole, involve helping students develop their team-building, communication, problem-solving, and self-regulatory learning skills. This study focuses on cohorts of students from the first and second years of the program (2002\xe2\x80\x932003 and 2003\xe2\x80\x932004); it is based on end-of-semester surveys and focus groups, and on additional focus groups conducted when these students were upperclassmen. Students felt Terrascope helped them make significant improvements in their ability to work in teams and to take on complex, multidisciplinary problems. They felt that the program\xe2\x80\x99s two-semester structure gave them an opportunity to develop and nurture these skills, and that the program prepared them well for their later work at MIT. They also felt that being engaged, as freshmen, in a distinct learning community, significantly eased their transition into MIT. We describe lessons learned in the development of Terrascope and offer suggestions for other institutions planning to develop similar programs.'

Abstract: "It has often been assumed that peoples living today as foragers in tropical rain forests are remnants of paleolithic populations that have been subsisting in their forest habitats for millennia and have only recently come into contact with sources of domesticated plants and animals. Independently, the two of us have published articles that challenge this view and propose the hypothesis that hunter- gatherers could never have lived in tropical rain forest without direct or indirect access to cultivated foods. This article serves as an introduction to six articles in this issue of Human Ecology, all devoted to this hypothesis. To provide background for this journal's readers, we summarize here our original articles."

Abstract: 'The arid and semi-arid regions account for approximately 30% of the world total area and are inhabited by approximately 20% of the total world population. Issues of present and future climate variability and change on agriculture and forestry in the arid and semi-arid tropics of the world were examined and discussion under each of these issues had been presented separately for Asia, Africa and Latin America.'

Abstract: 'The extent and structure of the genetic variability of traditional varieties of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) have been little documented, despite considerable evidence for this crop\xc5\x9b great varietal diversity in traditional agroecosystems. We used microsatellite markers to assess the genetic structure of traditional landraces of sweet and bitter cassava collected from five South American sites. As reference, we used a sample of 38 accessions from a world collection of cultivated cassava. For a total of 10 loci examined, we found 15 alleles that were not represented in this sample. Ten of these had been previously detected in wild Manihot species. The geographical structure of genetic variability was weak, but the genetic differentiation between bitter and sweet landraces was significant, suggesting that each form had evolved separately after domestication. Our results showed that traditional landraces form an important source of genetic diversity and merit more attention from managers of crop genetic resources.'

Abstract: ' Since the 1976 publication of the CLIMAP ice age sea surface temperature (SST) reconstruction showing a 1\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x98C tropical cooling a substantial debate has arisen as to whether tropical SSTs may instead have been 4\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x88\x98 colder than present. Herein I review the arguments for large SST variations and question a number of key findings, particularly the validity of ice-age coral SST estimates and \xe2\x80\x9cdown-projecting\xe2\x80\x9d tropical snowline changes to the surface. GCM results indicate that an intermediate solution requiring \xe2\x88\xbc2.5 \xe2\x88\x98C warm pool cooling is consistent with most quantitative low elevation surface land data and is small enough to allow the persistence of tropical biota in the ocean during glacial times. The proposal reduces estimated ice-age climate sensitivity (for a doubling of CO2) from a \xe2\x80\x9chigh-end\xe2\x80\x9d sensitivity of about 4.5 \xe2\x88\x98C (for a 5\xe2\x80\x936 \xe2\x88\x98C tropical cooling) to a \xe2\x80\x9cmid-range\xe2\x80\x9d sensitivity of about 3.0 \xe2\x88\x98C for a 2.5 \xe2\x88\x98C warm-pool decrease.\n'

Abstract: 'We examined the relative importance of ecological parameters\xe2\x80\x94habitat productivity and seasonality\xe2\x80\x94and group history\xe2\x80\x94episodic predation, disease, and sudden habitat deterioration\xe2\x80\x94to explain variation in the density and group structure of howlers (Alouatta spp.). We use data from a census of Guanacaste National Park, Costa Rica, and a literature review characterizing 80 howler populations. In Guanacaste National Park both habitat type and degree of protection affect howler density and group structure. Howlers were found at the highest density and in the largest groups in areas of semievergreen forest, which ecological sampling indicates have the most consistent level of food production. Differences in density between the sector of the park that first received protected status and more recently protected areas may be due partially to the degree of protection the areas received. We test the prediction that howler density and group structure would be influenced by habitat productivity as indexed by rainfall. Average group size and sex ratios differ among species, but female-to-immature ratios do not. Considering all censuses at one site to be independent, there are significant interspecific differences in density, with Alouatta pigra occurring at lower densities than the other species. In spite of such variability, there is no relationship between annual rainfall and howler density, and rainfall had a variable effect on group size depending on the level of independence that was considered. While such ecological comparisons are unrefined, e.g., rainfall must be used as a surrogate for habitat production, the fact that so few relationships were documented suggests that factors other than the ecological factors considered here are responsible for the observed differences in population characteristics. We suggest that much of the variability in howler population characteristics is related to events occurring in the recent history of the groups, such as habitat alteration, hunting, food tree crop failure, and disease.'

Results are discussed in relation to the Pum\xc3\xa9 environmental and social situation, and briefly compared with results from other lowland South American groups.'

Abstract: 'We investigate the response of the atmospheric and land surface components of the CMIP5/AR5 Earth System model HadGEM2-ES to pre-industrial (PI: AD 1860) and last glacial maximum (LGM: 21\xc2\xa0kyr) boundary conditions. HadGEM2-ES comprises atmosphere, ocean and sea-ice components which are interactively coupled to representations of the carbon cycle, aerosols including mineral dust and tropospheric chemistry. In this study, we focus on the atmosphere-only model HadGEM2-A coupled to terrestrial carbon cycle and aerosol models. This configuration is forced with monthly sea surface temperature and sea-ice fields from equivalent coupled simulations with an older version of the Hadley Centre model, HadCM3. HadGEM2-A simulates extreme cooling over northern continents and nearly complete die back of vegetation in Asia, giving a poor representation of the LGM environment compared with reconstructions of surface temperatures and biome distributions. The model also performs significantly worse for the LGM in comparison with its precursor AR4 model HadCM3M2. Detailed analysis shows that the major factor behind the vegetation die off in HadGEM2-A is a subtle change to the temperature dependence of leaf mortality within the phenology model of HadGEM2. This impacts on both snow-vegetation albedo and vegetation dynamics. A new set of parameters is tested for both the pre-industrial and LGM, showing much improved coverage of vegetation in both time periods, including an improved representation of the needle-leaf forest coverage in Siberia for the pre-industrial. The new parameters and the resulting changes in global vegetation distribution strongly impact the simulated loading of mineral dust, an important aerosol for the LGM. The climate response in an abrupt 4\xc3\x97 pre-industrial CO2 simulation is also analysed and shows modest regional impacts on surface temperatures across the Boreal zone.'

Abstract: 'In order to examine the spatial distribution of forest resources on local territories and to understand the factors controlling such distributions, we studied the spatial patterns of a group of 23 useful plant species on the territory of a Kuna community in the province of Darien, Panama. A stratified random sampling scheme was used to survey the distribution and abundance of the species across a 3500 ha area around the village. Data on the physical environment as well as the geographic coordinates of the sample plots were also obtained. A series of canonical analyses was conducted to evaluate the species\xe2\x80\x93environment relationships and to identify spatial structures in the species distributions left unexplained by the environmental variables. Four distinct distribution patterns were identified among the species; these were most strongly explained by land-use, the degree of canopy closure and topography. Significant spatial structures, independent of the measured environmental variables, were related to anthropogenic pressure and an edaphic gradient, and the habitat associations of the individual species were described. The results obtained from this case study suggest that land-use dynamics may play a predominant role in structuring inhabited landscapes, and that diversity in distribution patterns and habitat associations will require a combination of spatially explicit management strategies to ensure the local resource base.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents comparative yet extensive analysis of existing non-conventional renewable resources, energy policies and gaps in BRICS countries. An intelligent transformation to green economy to maintain natural resources is noted. Brazil has stable energy policies and is the leading producer of biofuels following hydropower until 2014 but supported wind and solar power development by tendering specific tariffs for energy generation from solar and wind. Russia needs improvement in its legal and regulatory framework with more incentives in energy policies. China is improving upon wind and hydropower but it needs strong policy measures to put cap on increased CO2 emissions. India needs revision in energy policy and requires extra incentives and consumer specific energy policies for research-infrastructure and energy generation technologies. South Africa requires lessons to increase renewable energy and reduce coal mining. Moreover, BRICS countries need to redefine their energy policies based upon their existing geographical, economical, societal and environmental conditions which will help in shaping global energy policies and more financial stability. This paper recognizes the potential of BRICS to reshape the global system paralleled with minimizing CO2 emissions. The concerted role of BRICS needs to be recognized as the leading contributor of global renewable capacity where the developed world is geared and busy to address the environmental issues.'

Abstract: 'Although researchers have documented the role of anthropogenic huntingpressure on the abundance of game, few have measured the direct effects ofincome or economic development on game abundance. Economic theory tends topredict an ambiguous causal relation between income and the abundance of game.Here we test whether income (a standard proxy of economic development) erodesthe abundance of game in two Tawahka Amerindian villages in the rain forest ofHonduras. The two villages have similar ecologies and weather and lie 17km apart but differ in income, population size, wealth, thepresence of outside institutions, and hunting pressure. A census of animals doneover 2 continuous years suggests that the richer village had less game andrelatively fewer large-bodied animals. At the level of animal groups (e.g.,mammals) or individual species, or when we include controls for the simultaneouseffect of vegetation type, distance from the start of the hunting trail, andtime of the year through a random-effect probit model, the two villages displayno statistically significant differences in game abundance. A random-effect,multivariate tobit model, in fact, suggests that being in the more remotevillage correlated with 43.5% fewer animals seen in any one encounter; resultswere significant at the 99% confidence level. The conclusions contain adiscussion of why income might produce ambiguous effects on game abundance andthe tradeoffs of using bivariate and multivariate techniques to analyze thecovariates of game abundance in the tropical rain forests of the New World.'

Abstract: 'Monographic data rely on specimens deposited in herbaria and museums, which have been thoroughly revised by experts. However, monographic data have been rarely used to map species richness at large scale, mainly because of the difficulties caused by spatially heterogeneous sampling effort. In this paper we estimate patterns of species richness and narrow endemism, based on monographic data of 4,055 Neotropical angiosperm species. We propose a geometric interpolation method to derive species ranges at a 1\xc2\xb0 grid resolution. To this we apply an inverse distance-weighted summation scheme to derive maps of species richness and endemism. In the latter we also adjust for heterogeneous sampling effort. Finally, we test the robustness of the interpolated species ranges and derived species richness by applying the same method but using a leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV). The derived map shows four distinct regions of elevated species richness: (1) Central America, (2) the Northern Andes, (3) Amazonia and (4) the Brazilian Atlantic coast (\xe2\x80\x98Mata Atl\xc3\xa2ntica\xe2\x80\x99). The region with the highest estimated species richness is Amazonia, with Central America following closely behind. Centers of narrow endemism are located over the entire Neotropics, several of them coinciding with regions of elevated species richness. Sampling effort has a minor influence on the interpolation of overall species richness, but it substantially influences the estimation of regions of narrow endemism. Thus, in order to improve maps of narrow endemism and resulting conservation efforts, more collection and identification activity is required.'

Abstract: 'Studies of sympatric species can provide important data to define how dietary and habitat requirements differ among them. I collected dietary data during a first yearlong comparative study of wild groups of Callimico goeldii, Saguinus labiatus and S. fuscicollis. Dietary overlap was highest between Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus labiatus throughout the year, and lowest between Saguinus labiatus and Callimico goeldii. All three species had high dietary overlap in February and March when a few abundant fruit species dominated their diets. Although all three species rely heavily on many of the same fruits and arthropods, there are several important distinctions among their diets. Surprisingly, Callimico goeldii consume large quantities of fungus throughout the year: 29% of annual feeding records. Mycophagy is more frequent in the dry season when fruits are scarce. In contrast, Saguinus labiatus rarely eat fungus during the period of fruit scarcity, and instead rely on nectar, a resource never exploited by Callimico goeldii. Saguinus fuscicollis also rely on nectar during periods of low fruit availability and increase their intake of arthropods and exudates. During April, a period of fruit scarcity, exudates comprise >50% of the feeding records of Saguinus fuscicollis. The use of different food resources during fruit scarcity, and differences in the heights at which each species feeds and forages appear to define a distinct ecological niche for each of them and allow them to maintain long-term associations throughout the year. Furthermore, I hypothesize that the limited distribution of Callimico goeldii may result from their restriction to forests that have high disturbance rates, where microhabitats appropriate for fungal growth are abundant, but which also contain abundant fruit and insects.'

Abstract: 'In a malaria-endemic area the distribution of patients is neither constant in time nor homogeneous in space. The WHO recommends the stratification of malaria risk on a fine geographical scale. In the village of Cacao in French Guiana, the study of the spatial and temporal distribution of malaria cases, during an epidemic, allowed a better understanding of the environmental factors promoting malaria transmission.'

Abstract: 'The simple view of the classical phytoplankton\xe2\x80\x93zooplankton\xe2\x80\x93fish food chain (CFC) has been replaced by a more complex framework, integrating microbial compartments (microbial food web, MFW). Few studies considered all components of the pelagic MFW in freshwaters and mostly are from temperate regions. We investigated carbon partitioning in the CFC and the MFW in an Amazonian floodplain system and analyzed the strength of interactions among components through structure equation modeling. We hypothesized that (i) MFW contributes highly to total plankton biomass throughout the year; and (ii) all plankton communities increase in biomass during low water, increasing the role of trophic interactions. We collected 30 subsurface samples (nutrients and plankton communities). MFW predominated over CFC in carbon biomass, and plankton components and their interactions changed according to the contrasting water level. Because phosphorus can be a potentially limiting resource for strict primary producers, higher biomass and a more complex MFW occurred during low water. We concluded that hydrology is a key factor shaping biotic interactions during low-water periods, and that MFW plays a key role in floodplain lakes, being potential mixotrophy an important strategy for phytoplankton.'

Abstract: 'The hypothesis that ants (Pheidole minutula) associated with the myrmecophytic melastome Maieta guianensis defend their host-plant against herbivores was investigated in a site near Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. M. guianensis is a small shrub that produces leaf pouches as ant domatia. Plants whose ants were experimentally removed suffered a significant increase in leaf damage compared with control plants (ants maintained). Ants patrol the young and mature leaves of Maieta with the same intensity, presumably since leaves of both ages are equally susceptible to herbivore attack. The elimination of the associated ant colony, and consequent increase in herbivory, resulted in reduced plant fitness. Fruit production was 45 times greater in plants with ants than in plants without ants 1 year after ant removal.'

Abstract: 'The mammalian fauna of the eastern Caatinga, a Brazilian semiarid biome, was surveyed in the dry and wet seasons aiming to contribute to the knowledge of this poorly known region. Complementary live-trap survey methods were employed for sampling small non-volant mammals and transects along roads for medium and large mammals.'

Abstract: 'The emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) is a key criterion in the environmental assessment of biofuels. Life cycle inventories taking into account the latest methodological developments are an essential prerequisite for this assessment. In the last years, substantial progresses in the modelling of nitrogen emissions relevant for the climate as well as in modelling the emissions from land use change (LUC) have been achieved. Therefore, the biomass production inventories in the ecoinvent database were revised to take into account these developments.'

Abstract: 'National height reference systems have conventionally been linked to the local mean sea level, observed at individual tide gauges. Due to variations in the sea surface topography, the reference levels of these systems are inconsistent, causing height datum offsets of up to \xc2\xb11\xe2\x80\x932 m. For the unification of height systems, a satellite-based method is presented that utilizes global geopotential models (GGMs) derived from ESA\xe2\x80\x99s satellite mission Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE). In this context, height datum offsets are estimated within a least squares adjustment by comparing the GGM information with measured GNSS/leveling data. While the GNSS/leveling data comprises the full spectral information, GOCE GGMs are restricted to long wavelengths according to the maximum degree of their spherical harmonic representation. To provide accurate height datum offsets, it is indispensable to account for the remaining signal above this maximum degree, known as the omission error of the GGM. Therefore, a combination of the GOCE information with the high-resolution Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) is performed. The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the benefit, when high-frequency topography-implied gravity signals are additionally used to reduce the remaining omission error of EGM2008. In terms of a spectral extension, a new method is proposed that does not rely on an assumed spectral consistency of topographic heights and implied gravity as is the case for the residual terrain modeling (RTM) technique. In the first step of this new approach, gravity forward modeling based on tesseroid mass bodies is performed according to the Rock\xe2\x80\x93Water\xe2\x80\x93Ice (RWI) approach. In a second step, the resulting full spectral RWI-based topographic potential values are reduced by the effect of the topographic gravity field model RWI_TOPO_2015, thus, removing the long to medium wavelengths. By using the latest GOCE GGMs, the impact of topography-implied gravity signals on the estimation of height datum offsets is analyzed in detail for representative GNSS/leveling data sets in Germany, Austria, and Brazil. Besides considerable changes in the estimated offset of up to 3 cm, the conducted analyses show that significant improvements of 30\xe2\x80\x9340% can be achieved in terms of a reduced standard deviation and range of the least squares adjusted residuals.'

Abstract: 'Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) performance may get degraded due to component degradation, aging, thermal variations of the environment and so on. Performance degradation should be corrected when the spaceborne SAR is in orbit. Calibration is implemented on the radar imagery by radiometric calibration which gives the relationship between digital number and backscattering coefficient. Radiometric calibration gives calibration constant, which is the key parameter to convert the SAR digital numbers into backscattering coefficient. With radiometrically calibrated image, the performance of one sensor can be compared with other sensors through multiple acquisitions to improve quantitative analysis of SAR performance. Radiometric calibration is done by ground deployed corner reflectors (CR). CRs have well-known radar cross sections, and hence, the derived radar cross sections from the SAR image are compared with the theoretical RCS to characterize the SAR sensor. An attempt is made to study the effectiveness of calibration, using different combination of CRs (various sizes and shapes) by deploying CR\xe2\x80\x99s in the Jain Global institutions\xe2\x80\x94JGI global Campus, Jakkasandra, Bangalore, and average sigma-naught (\xcf\x830) is estimated through multiple acquisitions of Sentinel-1A. Sentinel-1A was launched by European Space agency in 2014, having SAR as a payload. Sentinel-1A is an open source system which operates in four different modes with different resolution schemes. In this paper, Interferometric Wide swath mode of Sentinel-1A is used as that particular mode of acquisition is available over Jain Global campus. This paper presents the general criteria for selection of CRs and the measures taken during deployment. Integral method is used to estimate the calibration coefficient of Sentinel SAR data with different interpolation factors.\n'

Abstract: 'This research examines how and why consumers evaluate brand messages about corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities differently. Insights from secondary data suggest that brands may prioritize environmental activities over social activities, and vice versa, depending on the type of company. Using a field experiment and surveys, we explore whether consumers\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward these brand decisions follow company priorities. We find that consumers perceive brands that sell goods and communicate messages about environmental sustainability activities more positively than services companies, while consumers perceive brands that provide services and communicate messages about social sustainability activities more positively than goods companies. We show that the tangibility of the brand\xe2\x80\x99s offering also impacts brand attitudes in a similar way. These findings have important implications for brand managers as they communicate CSR activities and attempt to maximize sustainability investments across various causes.'

Abstract: 'Implicit intergroup biases have been shown to impact social behavior in many unsettling ways, from disparities in decisions to \xe2\x80\x9cshoot\xe2\x80\x9d black and white men in a computer simulation to unequal gender-based evaluations of r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s and CVs. It is a difficult question whether, and in what way, agents are responsible for behaviors affected by implicit biases. I argue that in paradigmatic cases agents are responsible for these behaviors in the sense that the behavior is \xe2\x80\x9cattributable\xe2\x80\x9d to them. That is, behaviors affected by implicit biases reflect upon who one is as a moral agent.'

Abstract: "In the past few decades, Latin America has encountered two related developments that are transforming indigenous peoples' ownership, use, and management of land and resources. The first has been a wave of political organizing among indigenous communities. International linkages, national and regional confederations, and local, intercommunal organizations have proliferated across Central and South America. Secondly, there has been a swift rise in the number and influence of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), which have brought unprecedented financial support and political leverage to the struggles of indigenous people. This paper examines development, natural resource management, and ecopolitics in the Chiquitano communities of Lomerio in the Bolivian lowlands. I discuss the impact of NGO and government policies and practices on Chiquitano political organization, and present examples of political agency on the part of the Chiquitanos, and features of the structural conditions that frame relations among the different groups."

Abstract: 'The nature of and driving forces behind variation among wetland forests in terms of biogeochemistry and vegetation production are not well understood. We suggest that insight into biogeochemical and productivity differences may be gained by examining the degree to which nitrogen and phosphorus are balanced within wetland vegetation. On the basis of examinations of data related to N:P balance and nutrient use efficiencies, vegetation productivity in both depressional and riverine forests appears to be primarily N limited. In contrast to some current theories of wetland biogeochemistry, these data suggest that when P deficiency occurs at all, it represents a secondary productivity constraint in comparison to N. Similarly, a biogeochemical continuum is suggested for wetland forests based on the relationship between N:P ratios in senesced foliage vs. annual litterfall mass. We theorize that the position of a particular wetland forest on this continuum reflects the integration of its geomorphic position and biogeochemical history. In addition, the position of a particular system on the continuum may have predictive value with regard to net primary productivity and nutrient transformation capabilities.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the potential of the new generation of satellite precipitation product from the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) to characterize the rainfall in Malaysia. Most satellite precipitation products have limited ability to precisely characterize the high dynamic rainfall variation that occurred at both time and scale in this humid tropical region due to the coarse grid size to meet the physical condition of the smaller land size, sub-continent and islands. Prior to the status quo, an improved satellite precipitation was required to accurately measure the rainfall and its distribution. Subsequently, the newly released of GPM precipitation product at half-hourly and 0.1\xc2\xb0 resolution served an opportunity to anticipate the aforementioned conflict. Nevertheless, related evidence was not found and therefore, this study made an initiative to fill the gap. A total of 843 rain gauges over east (Borneo) and west Malaysia (Peninsular) were used to evaluate the rainfall the GPM rainfall data. The assessment covered all critical rainy seasons which associated with Asian Monsoon including northeast (Nov. - Feb.), southwest (May - Aug.) and their subsequent inter-monsoon period (Mar. - Apr. & Sep. - Oct.). The ability of GPM to provide quantitative rainfall estimates and qualitative spatial rainfall patterns were analysed. Our results showed that the GPM had good capacity to depict the spatial rainfall patterns in less heterogeneous rainfall patterns (Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s correlation, 0.591 to 0.891) compared to the clustered one (r = 0.368 to 0.721). Rainfall intensity and spatial heterogeneity that is largely driven by seasonal monsoon has significant influence on GPM ability to resolve local rainfall patterns. In quantitative rainfall estimation, large errors can be primarily associated with the rainfall intensity increment. 77% of the error variation can be explained through rainfall intensity particularly the high intensity (> 35 mm d-1). A strong relationship between GPM rainfall and error was found from heavy (~35 mm d-1) to violent rain (160 mm d-1). The output of this study provides reference regarding the performance of GPM data for respective hydrology studies in this region.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the relationships between water chemistry and the occurrence, distribution, physiology, and morphology of fish faunas. We examined 34 species (ca. 10% of the Argentinean freshwater fish fauna) from 120 localities (5 areas) situated between 26\xc2\xb015\xe2\x80\xb2 S (Trancas, Tucum\xc3\xa1n) and 38\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\xb2 S (Sierra de la Ventana, Buenos Aires). Fourteen chemical features are described by: conductivity, total dissolved solids, temperature, pH, CO 3 2\xe2\x88\x92 , CO3H\xe2\x88\x92, Cl\xe2\x88\x92, SO 4 2\xe2\x88\x92 Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Na+, Mg/Ca, Mg+Ca/Na+K. Three Basic Data Matrices considering the mean, maximum and minimum values of each variable for each fish species were used in a Cluster and Principal Component Analysis. Groups of species clustered in similar ways to particular water chemistries. Similarity was the common occurrence of species in a defined area and preference for a common range of the factors considered. Groups of species so defined showed patterns of distribution related to climate, environment, trophic state and hydrographic complexity. Each cluster included some eurytopic species which appeared together at extreme chemical and geographic characteristics. Twenty four species had ranges of tolerance for the 14 variables and evidence of a grouping according to these ranges. Eighteen species which occurred at maximum or minimum absolute values for more than one factor were ordered along an eurytopy \xe2\x80\x94 stenotopy axis. We support the statement that species with a larger tolerance range for most factors have a higher probability of being widely distributed. Astyanax fasciatus and A. bimaculatus tolerated the highest number of maximum and minimum values, followed by Jenynsia l. lineata, A. eigenmanniorum and Trichomycterus corduvensis. Groups of species based on chemical factors showed differences in the relative number of basic morphological types.'

Abstract: 'Religious beliefs and practices have long influenced human perceptions and uses of nature. Animals in particular play a prominent role in magico-religious practices and given the historical and cultural depth of these relationships, understanding human-faunal relations is often fundamental to the cause of meaningful wildlife conservation. This study investigates the domestic and wild harvested species used for spiritual and religious purposes by adherents of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candombl\xc3\xa9. Introduced by enslaved Africans, this belief system combines animal and plant traditions derived from Africa with many others assimilated from Amerindians. We identified a total of 129 species of animals (or animal derived products) used and/or sold for magico-religious purposes; of these, 34. 8\xc2\xa0% (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8945) are included in some list of threatened species. Most animals reported were mammals (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8929), followed by mollusks (20), fishes (19), birds (18) and reptiles (16); the majority (78\xc2\xa0%) of reported species were wild-caught from terrestrial habitats (62\xc2\xa0%), followed by marine and estuarine (24\xc2\xa0%), and freshwater (14\xc2\xa0%). We identified an extensive commercial network of collectors, middlemen/distributors, shop owners, and consumers. Rarity of a given species was often positively associated with economic value. Considering the ubiquity and underground nature of these practices, future conservation strategists are encouraged to work with Candombl\xc3\xa9 practitioners.'

Abstract: 'Plant domestication is an evolutionary process whose artificial selection and management change the landscape, modeling plants to satisfy the human needs, affecting the phenotype component(s) of the species under manipulation. This study aimed at examining and comparing two rural communities: Malhada de Areia e Car\xc3\xa3o, municipally of Altinho, Pernambuco regarding the knowledge, perception of morphological variations (size fruit, flavor fruit, shape fruit, yield pulp and fruit color), morphological characteristics of preference at the time of collection; evaluation on the inter- and intrapopulation morphological differences of species and assessment of diversity, variability and local genetic structure of Spondias tuberosa populations under different management regimes based on the ISSR analysis. The results pointed to the maintenance of local genetic and morphological diversity, being it strongly related to the management practices of the species, especially the S. tuberosa tolerance in open areas for farming and pasture. Thus, it is emphasized the importance of this study in Brazil by being the first time that aspects related to management and perceived diversity, morphology and genetics of a highlighted perennial species from the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil are evaluated from the perspective of domestication studies on its incipient status. Moreover, it provides interesting data that will contribute to the conservation strategies and breeding programs.'

Abstract: 'Participation has been widely touted as \xe2\x80\x9cthe answer\xe2\x80\x9d to a number of problems facing agroforestry research programs. It is not enough, however, to involve rural people as workers and informants in research endeavors defined by outsiders. A truly collaborative approach will depend upon our ability to broaden our definitions of research and participation, to accommodate a wide spectrum of land users and local knowledge, and to expand our repertoire of research methods. This paper presents a critique of facile approaches to participation, outlines a more inclusive framework for who participates on what terms, and reviews a variety of methods that address the complex realities of rural life and landscapes. The final section of the paper suggest a multi-institutional model that combines the complementary strengths of several types of organizations in participatory field research.'

Abstract: 'In part 3 of this series of papers on a new 3-D global troposphericchemical transport model, using an Integrated Modelling System (IMS), anevaluation of the model performance in simulating global distributions andseasonal variations for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere,is presented. Comparisons of model OH concentrations with previous modelstudies show consistent modelled OH levels from the subtropics tomidlatitudes, while more discrepancies occur over the tropical lowlatitudes, with IMS predicting the highest levels of OH. The close agreementbetween modelled OH concentrations over midlatitudes, where high surfaceNOxand VOC concentrations are also found, is indicative of the strongphotochemical coupling between NOx, VOCs and O3 overthese latitudes. IMSOH concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes during summerare generally lower than available measurements, implying that models ingeneral are underestimating OH levels at this location and time of year.Substantial differences between model OH concentrations over low latitudesclearly highlight areas of uncertainty between models. IMS OH concentrationsare the highest in general of the models compared, one possible reason isthat biogenic emissions of species such as isoprene and monoterpenes arehighest in IMS, leading to higher O3 levels and hence higher OH.Generally, the IMS VOC concentrations show a similar seasonality to themeasurements at most locations. In general though, IMS tends to underestimatethe NH wintertime VOC maximum and overestimate the NH summertime VOCminimum. Such an overestimate in summer could be due to IMSunderestimating OH levels, or an overestimation of VOC emissions or possiblya problem with model transport, all of these possibilities are explored.Except for n-pentane, the model underprediction of a VOC maximum during theNH winter month strongly suggests a missing emission mechanism in the modelor an underestimate of an existing one. It is very likely that there is alack of time varying emission sources in the model to account for theseasonal change in emission behaviour such as increasing energy usage (e.g.,electricity and gas), road transportation, engine performance, and otheranthropogenic factors which show strong seasonal characteristics. Theanomalous overprediction of wintertime n-pentane compared with its closesummertime prediction with the measurements suggest that emissions in thiscase may be too high.'

Abstract: 'As deforestation and land-use/land-cover change advance in tropical forest regions, an understanding of how plants adjust phenology and reproductive dynamics to altered landscapes can provide insights into plasticity, productivity, and population persistence. We compared the reproductive phenology, sex expression, and flower and fruit production of two monoecious Amazonian palms, Attalea phalerata and Attalea speciosa, in old-growth forest and as remnant trees growing in actively grazed pastures. Using 2 years of phenology data collected from natural populations near Vila Extrema, Rond\xc3\xb4nia, and eastern Acre, Brazil, we compared flowering and fruiting in the two habitats and tested for effects of palm height, crown size, and light availability on inflorescence and sex expression. Forest conversion to pasture stimulated greater overall flowering and fruiting in individual Attalea palms. As a population, remnant pasture palms continuously bore flowers and fruits year-round, while forest palms flowered seasonally in isolated peaks with consecutive months of inactivity. Crown size and greater light exposure affected flowering and fruiting dynamics in A. phalerata and A. speciosa, respectively, and increased light availability shifted A. speciosa sex expression towards greater female investment, primarily through regulation of sex determination and bud abortion. Removal of tropical forest does not always lead to the downfall of remnant tree populations, and under favorable conditions, such as abandonment of cropland and pasture, higher levels of reproduction can facilitate recovery of future generations. Tree species with flexible sex expression may be particularly resilient in the face of land-use and land-cover change.'

Abstract: 'Shell-matrix sites are one of the most widespread archaeological deposits in the world. They inform archaeologists about human adaptations to coastal environments, the evolution of coastal economies, ritual practices, and prehistoric architecture. In recent years, the micromorphological study of Brazilian shellmounds and a shell midden from Tierra del Fuego revealed unique information about the human behaviors related to the formation of shell-matrix sites. These investigations refined our knowledge concerning the upward sequence of events involved in the growth and post-depositional evolution of the deposits. Micromorphological studies denied the traditional view of shell-matrix sites as simple secondary deposits of food remains, providing evidence of trampling surfaces, midden redeposition, domestic spaces, abandonment episodes, and intra-site differences. Dissimilarities were detected in the pre-depositional history of sediments in the shellmounds and shell middens that also attest to differences in site use and function. This comparative study highlights the role of micromorphology in the study of shell-matrix sites as a unique approach intended to disassemble the sequence of events hidden in the intricate stratigraphies. The technique has the potential to reveal microdepositional events and/or the weathering process of the seemingly thick layers of densely packed shell that characterize shell-matrix sites worldwide.'

Abstract: "An increasing number of studies indicate that (i) nutrient and water resources can be abundant in the subsoil and (ii) trees have deep root systems that can possibly reach these resources. It is less clear whether subsoil resources are actually improving water and nutrient status of tree-based cropping systems and whether they are significantly increasing crop production and yield. To answer such a question, the distribution of nutrient and water uptake by trees needs to be quantified. So-called `root activity distributions' give valuable information about actual subsoil use by trees whereas studies on root length or mass distributions do not often correlate with uptake distributions. Despite the usually lower relative root activity in the subsoil compared to the topsoil per unit soil, the large volume of subsoil in comparison to mostly shallow topsoil is an important resource for crop nutrient and water uptake. The present study compares published root activity distributions using the model Activity=Amax(1\xe2\x80\x93kdepth). The obtained regression constants k of 0.91\xe2\x80\x930.99 determined in this publication reflect the values computed by an earlier published survey for root biomass ranging from tundra to those of temperate forest biomes. Thus, tree crops can have shallow root activity and 75% of their total root activity in the first 0.1 m of soil, or very deep root activity with more than 90% below 0.1 m. Neither environmental factors (i.e., climate and soil properties available from these publications) nor plant species explain differences of root activity distributions with depth. The deepest root activity is found for fruit trees such as citrus, guava and mango. Shaded crops such as coffee and cacao tend to have shallower root activity than fruit trees. Monocots including oil palm, coconut or banana have root activity that can be both deep and shallow. Regional and temporal variations of subsoil root activity for the same tree species are significant and generally larger than differences between species. Root activity patterns of tree crops appear to be sufficiently flexible to allow for subsoil resource use. Consequently, management such as pruning, fertilization, liming and irrigation are shown to significantly affect subsoil root activity."

Abstract: 'The sloth\xe2\x80\x99s giant tick Amblyomma varium Koch, which is a neotropical species that inhabits tropical rainforests, is the largest tick reported to date. The adult stage of this tick parasitizes mammals from the families Bradypodidae and Magalonychidae (Xenarthra) nearly exclusively. This study aimed to describe morphological and histological features of the reproductive system and the oocyte maturation process of this tick species. The ovary of A. varium is a long single tubular organ that is horseshoe-shaped, winding and arranged in the posterior part of the body. Two oviducts are connected to the ovary on each side; these thicken at certain region forming the uterus (common oviduct), followed by a muscular connecting tube, vagina and genital aperture. A large number of oocytes at different stages of development are attached to the ovary wall by the pedicel, as they reach maturity they are released into the ovary lumen and from there to the genital aperture. These oocytes develop simultaneously and asynchronically along the ovary. Amblyomma varium oocytes were classified into five development stages (i.e., I\xe2\x80\x93V), and specific characteristics were observed; the processes of yolk and chorion deposition begin early in oocytes stage II, and oocytes V exhibit a very thick chorion and eggs of a large size. These characteristics are likely adaptations that enhance the survival and the reproductive success of this extremely host-specific tick, which is limited to a particular environment.'

Abstract: 'Mansonia altissima is an important West African timber tree species. For the purpose of examining the effect of human impact on its genetic diversity, genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of the species under different regimes of human impact were investigated in the Akure Forest Reserve, Nigeria, using 504 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The results indicate a very low genetic diversity in M. altissima within the forest reserve (He = 0.045; PPL = 16.75%; Br = 1.162). The highest genetic diversity was observed in the primary forest (He = 0.062; PPL = 21.00%; Br = 1.204), with the lowest genetic diversity in the isolated forest patch (He = 0.032; PPL = 9.00%; Br = 1.089). A significant and pronounced spatial genetic structure was found in the logged forest and in the isolated forest patch. In contrast, the primary forest exhibited very weak spatial genetic structuring. As expected, no spatial genetic structure was found in the planted stands of M. altissima. From a conservation point of view, our results suggest that genetic diversity of M. altissima is at risk in the forest reserve. The scale of human impact in the study area could pose a serious threat to the maintenance of genetic diversity of the species. These results would offer practical applications in the conservation of other tropical tree species.'

Abstract: ' Herreria montevidensis, locally known as \xe2\x80\x9csalsa\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csalsaparrilha,\xe2\x80\x9d is a vine belonging to the family Herreriaceae (APG 1998; Chase et al. 2000; Lopes et al. 2006), which sometimes is cited as synonymous of Asparagaceae (Smith et al. 2004; Mabberley 1997). The previously known economic importance of the family was restricted to a number of species of Herreria that are used in popular medicine as a depurative sweating agent, as a stimulant, and as a treatment for syphilis, skin infections, rheumatism, and other illnesses (Peckolt 1936; Cunha 1941; Stellfeld 1941, 1942; Moura 1943; Mas-Guindal 1945; Vandercolme 1947; Basualdo et al. 1995). In a report about H. montevidensis, Basualdo et al. (1995) relate that aqueous extracts of fresh subterranean material from H. montevidensis were used as a diuretic but they did not mention any use of this plant in handicrafts.'

Abstract: 'The major classes of tropical lakes include shallow, lowland lakes; deep, tertiary lakes; high altitudinal lakes; rainforests lakes; and man-made lakes at all latitudes and altitudes. Basic ecological processes are similar in temperate and tropical lakes, including grazing, competition, predation and abiotic adaptation. Small tropical lakes of intermediate age are probably not biotically more complicated than similar-sized temperate lakes. The structure of the areas of adaptative radiation and the dispersal ability of the species are important for the present distribution of taxa. Fish play a key role in the tropics since many species both consume zooplankton and compete with them for algal and pelagic sestonic food. This important co-evolution between fish and algae, leaving a fraction of the algal community with a predation refuge, may have decreased the ability of zooplankton to exploit algae. In addition, heavy predation from juvenile and adult fish may greatly simplify the zooplankton community, and have resulted in the scarcity of Cladocera, notably the efficient filter-feeder Daphnia. Little is known of possible physiological constraints to cladoceran distribution, however. Thus similar co-evolution as hypothesized between fish and algae seems not to have occurred to such a great extent between fish and zooplankton. Diurnal patterns in habitat selection of fish may also influence nutrient re-distribution in the tropics as in many temperate lakes. Serious environmental problems threaten tropical lakes, including eutrophication, clear-cutting of the rain forest, unwise introduction of new species not adapted to prevailing conditions, overfishing, extensive use of biocids, and probably acidic rain in areas with poorly buffered waters. Important processes in tropical lakes could be elucidated by concentrating research upon the fate of phytoplankton successional production, involving competition, grazing, sinking, fungi and bacterial attack. Co-evolution of fish and algae should be further investigated as it could in part explain the general scarcity and simplicity of the zooplankton community. Limnocorral experiments should also be used for further assessing processes in tropical lakes.'

Abstract: 'Many recent papers have documented the phytochemical and pharmacological bases for the use of palms (Arecaceae) in ethnomedicine. Early publications were based almost entirely on interviews that solicited local knowledge. More recently, ethnobotanically guided searches for new medicinal plants have proven more successful than random sampling for identifying plants that contain biodynamic ingredients. However, limited laboratory time and the high cost of clinical trials make it difficult to test all potential medicinal plants in the search for new drug candidates. The purpose of this study was to summarize and analyze previous studies on the medicinal uses of American palms in order to narrow down the search for new palm-derived medicines.'

Abstract: 'This paper gives crude estimates of the environmental consequences associated with the birth of one baby in the United States. We calculate the magnitude of one hundred environmental impacts which one American born today will cause over a lifetime. The impacts are grouped under five headings: waste generation, mineral consumption, energy consumption, ecosystem alteration, and food consumption. We also consider, but do not quantify, impacts on extinctions of species and indigenous cultures. Our purpose is to emphasize the role of population growth in the creation of environmental problems, and to make potential parents aware of their ability to impact the global environment. We conclude that one especially effective way for individuals to protect the national and global environment, and hence protect the wellbeing of all existing people, is to stop creating more humans.'

Abstract: 'The expanding agriculture in the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado, changes C and nutrient storages of the savanna ecosystems thereby affecting the global C budget and the sustainability of the local land use. We examined the biomass and the C, N, P, and S storages in above- and belowground biomass, in the organic layer, and in the top 2 m of the mineral soil (Anionic Acrustoxes) of three replicate plots of each of native Cerrado, Pinus caribaea Morelet plantations, productive and degraded Bracchiaria decumbens Stapf. pastures, and of conventional and no-tillage soybean cultivation. Aboveground biomass \xe2\x80\x93 in the cropping systems shortly before harvest \xe2\x80\x93 decreased in the order, Pinus (15 kg m\xe2\x88\x922) > Cerrado (2.3) > conventional tillage (1.9) > no tillage (1.5) > productive pasture (0.64) > degraded pasture (0.37) and belowground biomass in the order, Pinus (9.1) > Cerrado (3.0) > productive pasture (2.2) > degraded pasture (1.5) > conventional tillage (0.60) > no tillage (0.41). The aboveground biomass contained 1.1 (degraded pasture) to 19% (Pinus) of the total C storage, 0.3 (productive pasture, degraded pasture) to 3.5% of the total N storage, 0.3 (degraded pasture) to 2.1% (no tillage, conventional tillage) of the total P storage, and 0.3 (degraded pasture) to 3.7% (Pinus) of the total S storage of the ecosystems. Total C storage in the ecosystems was significantly larger in the Pinus stands (36 kg m\xe2\x88\x922) than in all other systems; differences among Cerrado (20), degraded pasture (19), productive pasture (20), no tillage (19), and conventional tillage (19) were small and not significant. All land-use systems had larger N (Pinus, 1.5; degraded pasture, 1.3; productive pasture, 1.4; no tillage, 1.4; conventional tillage, 1.4 kg m\xe2\x88\x922) and S storage (PI, 28; degraded pasture, 33; productive pasture, 34; no tillage, 36; conventional tillage, 38 g m\xe2\x88\x922) than the Cerrado (N, 1.2 kg; S, 26 g m\xe2\x88\x922). The P storages varied between 17 and 29 g m\xe2\x88\x922 and were not significantly different among the studied ecosystems. The N and S accumulations in the 12\xe2\x80\x9320-year-old land-use systems were larger than the cumulative known fertilizer inputs indicating that there were unknown inputs possibly including the exploration of the deeper subsoil by deep-reaching roots and transfer of nutrients to the topsoil. Our results indicate that afforestation with Pinus trees has the potential to sequester large amounts of C while pasture degradation, no tillage, and conventional tillage tended to result in small C losses. Land use resulted in a marked accumulation of N and S relative to the Cerrado.'

Abstract: 'Swidden farming has been blamed for the degradation of tropical forest, where it is widely used. However, when the cropping period is short and the fallow period long, the system is shown to be ideally suited to this environment. But this entails a low population density. When this is exceeded, the fallow must be shortened, resulting in loss of forest through grassland invasion, or of the soil itself through erosion or laterization, as shown by modern examples and by the history of the Maya. The degradation blamed on swidden farming is thus not due to the system itself, but to overpopulation, in H.G. Wells\'s words, "the fundamental evil out of which all the others that afflicted the race arose."'

Abstract: 'Negative emission technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) are regarded as an option to achieve the climatic target of the Paris Agreement. However, our understanding of the realistic sustainable feasibility of the global lands for BECCS remains uncertain. In this study, we assess the impact of BECCS deployment scenarios on the land systems including land use, water resources, and ecosystem services. Specifically, we assess three land-use scenarios to achieve the total amount of 3.3\xc2\xa0GtC\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 (annual negative emission level required for IPCC-RCP 2.6) emission reduction by growing bioenergy crops which requires huge use of global agricultural and forest lands and water. Our study shows that (1) vast conversion of food cropland into rainfed bio-crop cultivation yields a considerable loss of food production that may not be tolerable considering the population increase in the future. (2) When irrigation is applied to bio-crop production, the bioenergy crop productivity is enhanced. This suppresses the necessary area for bio-crop production to half, and saves the land for agricultural productions. However, water consumption is doubled and this may exacerbate global water stress. (3) If conversion of forest land for bioenergy crop cultivation is allowed without protecting the natural forests, large areas of tropical forest could be used for bioenergy crop production. Forest biomass and soil carbon stocks are reduced, implying degradation of the climate regulation and other ecosystem services. These results suggest that without a careful consideration of the land use for bioenergy crop production, a large-scale implementation of BECCS could negatively impact food, water and ecosystem services that are supporting fundamental human sustainability.'

Abstract: 'Orchid bees (Apidae, Euglossini) are important pollinators in the Amazon forest. In eastern Brazilian Amazon, secondary forest and pastures are being replaced by oil palm plantations. Here, we tested the role of forest reserves and riparian corridors in maintaining orchid bees. We sampled bees in three different soil-type uses, comparing richness, abundance, and assemblage composition. Estimated richness was lowest in palm plantations than in forest reserves and riparian corridors on diversity of orchid bees. Riparian corridors had the highest abundance, followed by reserves, and oil palm plantations. Bee assemblage also varied with land cover, with the reserves having the most distinct composition. We also identified indicator bees for primary forest. Our results demonstrate riparian corridors and forest reserves can maintain orchid bees in oil palm landscapes.'

Abstract: "The conservation and utilization of allied gene resources is vital for the improvement of crop species. Rubber has been an undeniably beneficial commodity for the past 100 years. Progress in yield improvement over 70 years resulted in primary and hybrid clones with exceptional yielding abilities. The extension of Hevea to marginal areas necessitated breeding of new clones with resistance to environmental constraints. India, China, Brazil, Thailand, C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire and Vietnam have marginal environments with single or multiple constraints such as low temperature, wind, higher altitude, moisture deficit and diseases. Allied species and accessions from the Brazil Amazonia can be integrated into such breeding programmes. Many of these clones are resultant of natural interspecific hybridizations. Also, allied species are excellent resources of timber. Molecular interventions revealed mtDNA of modern clones are highly conserved contributed by only two clones (PB 56 and Tjir 1). Nuclear DNA is highly divergent due to breeding and selection under varied geo-climates. The adaptation of allied species and wild accessions under a wide range of environments of Brazil is promising as a source of variation for breeding, and enables selection of clones for specific marginal areas."

Abstract: 'Given the scarcity of oil reserves, renewable sources of energy have become important. The Brazilian government has established standards and policies to foment the use of bio-energy. Bio-fuels have widespread use and have been inserted into the national energy matrix to help sustainable development. It is necessary to establish the effectiveness of these government initiatives in preserving ecology; otherwise environmental harm such as the loss of biodiversity will increase. The objective of this paper is to identify and analyse, from a systems point of view, the potential benefits and risks to the environment which may arise from the use of bio-energy; whether its production is in agreement with the Brazilian constitution and whether its environmental impact is beneficial when it is exploited economically. It also examines the legal aspects of the National Energy Policy and the introduction of bio-diesel. We conclude that the place of bio-fuel in the Brazilian and the world\xe2\x80\x99s energy matrix is irreversible and furthermore, that its role will increase sharply in the future.'

Abstract: 'Trypsin inhibitor gene sequences were used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among Theobroma and Herrania species, considered as sister-groups, with particular interest on the monophyly and infra-generic relationships of Theobroma. The presumed amino acid sequences of 23 analyzed samples, from 11 Theobroma and three Herrania species, comprising all sections from both genera, demonstrated a high similarity with a previously characterized T. cacao Kunitz trypsin inhibitor. The trypsin inhibitor gene accumulated mutations at faster rate than prior analyzed nuclear or chloroplastic genes. None of the sequences presented introns. The phylogeny of the trypsin inhibitor sequences was congruent with the phylogenetic hypotheses of the Theobroma and Herrania species based on morphology. The monophyly of Theobroma was not strongly supported, corroborating previously described absence of obvious synapomorphies for Theobroma. The species grouped consistently according to genus and section. The monophyly of all Theobroma sections was supported, except for section Glossopetalum, which was paraphyletic to section Andropetalum. Evidences sustain that T. mammosum may be included into section Glossopetalum. The potential use of trypsin inhibitor gene sequences in phylogenetic studies of Theobroma was demonstrated.'

Abstract: 'This study evaluated the effect of nutrient application on the regrowth dynamics of secondary fallow vegetation in an intensely exploited shifting cultivation area in the eastern Amazon region of Brazil. The importance of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S and a mixture of micronutrients was tested in a minus-one-trial by comparison with a full complement of nutrients and unfertilized control plots. Fertilizers were applied three times during the experiment and their effects were monitored over a period of 2 1/2 years. Prior to the second fertilization, one third of each experimental plot was cleared of the vegetation cover and planted in maize, prior to the third fertilizer application these subplots were planted in sorghum. Biomass of maize and sorghum were used to indicate nutrient constraints and fertilizing effects due to the different treatments. Both crops were limited by P- and N-availability, with greater responses to P. The initial fertilization did not affect the biomass accumulation of the secondary vegetation during the first 15 months, but two additional applications significantly increased biomass in the complete fertilizer treatment compared to the unfertilized control. Biomass accumulation was primarily P-limited, N-limitation was apparent but not significant. The remaining nutrients did not affect plant growth. Fertilization favored production of nutrient-rich leaves. Application of readily available nutrients gave grasses a competitive edge over slower reacting woody vegetation. Fertilization also caused significant shifts in the contribution of woody species to biomass accumulation, as could be demonstrated for two prominent pioneer tree species. Growth response to fertilization as well as the primary limiting nutrient varied among seven dominant species monitored in the secondary vegetation. We conclude that growth of tropical secondary vegetation can be nutrient limited and it might respond significantly to additional nutrients by increasing biomass production.'

Abstract: 'The contribution of systematics to conservation and sustainable use of species is discussed. An adequate inventory of species is required for both areas and recent field work shows that the inventory is far from complete. This supports the first mission of Agenda 2000 which is to discover described and inventory global species diversity. The importance of making these data available in data base format is stressed. Sound systematics is a necessity for conservation legislation where control depends on the ability to identify organisms correctly. The establishment of reserves is also dependent upon data from systematics about centres of diversity and endemism and examples of this are given. Molecular systematics has made new tools available to conservation such as genetic fingerprinting which is useful both to breeding programmes of rare species and for identification for legal proceedings.'

Abstract: 'Reptiles have served as an important source of protein for human populations around the world. Exploitation for food is heaviest in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, but also occurs in temperate areas. Of all reptiles, turtles are the most heavily exploited for human consumption. High, unsustainable levels of exploitation for food are directly responsible for the precarious conservation status of many turtles. Crocodilians, snakes, and lizards may be locally important food sources, however, with the exception of a few lizard species, they are exploited in a less intense and generally non-commercial manner for human consumption. In comparison, the commercial skin trade poses a far greater threat to the survival of crocodilians as well as certain large snakes and lizards. Recent field reports have implicated the south east Asian medicinal trade as a growing threat to reptiles, especially turtles and snakes. There are few unequivocal examples of managed harvest programmes for reptiles that are economically and culturally viable, as well as biologically sustainable. Given the economic importance of reptiles as sources of protein and other highly valued commodities, it is imperative that more attention be focused on the development of sustainable use programmes for these species.'

Abstract: 'Field measurements of radiation fluxes\xe2\x80\x94notably downwelling longwave radiation flux (LW flux)\xe2\x80\x94are as yet rare or nonexistent outside a very select number of sites in the tropics. Data gaps can only be filled through the use of estimation schemes based on measurements of other meteorological variables, and there is a need for recommendations on best practice in this area. We selected 18 contrasting semi-empirical estimation schemes for downward longwave radiation, based on air emissivities, combined with six different sky cover estimation schemes and compared the expected longwave flux with hourly observations from a flux tower at Caxiuan\xc3\xa3 in Brazil. Of all schemes tested, the Dilley\xe2\x80\x93Kimball emissivity scheme combined with Kasten and Czeplak\xe2\x80\x99s sky cover scheme during the day and Dilley and O\xe2\x80\x99Brien\xe2\x80\x99s model B scheme at night proved to be the most reliable, yielding estimates of LW flux generally within 20\xc2\xa0W/m2 of measurements across all time points.'

Abstract: 'An understanding of factors that influence species richness of lotic insects is generally lacking. We present comparative data on aquatic insect species richness from several North American and other streams. Factors such as large sample numbers and drainage area (species area relationships) are not significant predictors of species richness across the streams we examined. We explore several hypotheses regarding the origins and maintenance of species richness using Upper Three Runs Creek (UTR), South Carolina, USA, as a reference stream. UTR has the highest species richness of any stream in the Western Hemisphere. Hypotheses examined included historical, regional and local processes such as: (1) Evolutionary time, (2) disturbance regime/environmental variability, (3) temperature/evolutionary-speed, (4) productivity, and (5) habitat heterogeneity. Of these hypotheses, we suggest that productivity and habitat heterogeneity appear to contribute most to the high species richness found in UTR. We believe that multidisciplinary analysis of other streams is necessary because without this crucial information our knowledge of, and desire to protect biodiversity in streams will be wanting.'

Abstract: 'This paper reports the main results of an assessment of the global-scale implications of the stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 750 ppm (by 2250) and 550 ppm (by 2150), in relationto a scenario of unmitigated emissions. The climate change scenarios were derived from simulation experiments conducted with the HadCM2 global climate model and forced with the IPCC IS92a, S750 and S550 emissions scenarios. The simulated changes in climate were applied to an observed global baseline climatology, and applied with impacts models to estimate impacts on natural vegetation, water resources, coastal flood risk and wetland loss, crop yield and food security, and malaria. The studies used a single set of population and socio-economic scenarios about the future that are similar to those adopted in the IS92a emissions scenario.An emissions pathway which stabilises CO2 concentrations at 750 ppmby the 2230s delays the 2050 temperature increase under unmitigated emissions by around 50 years. The loss of tropical forest and grassland which occurs by the 2050s under unmitigated emissions is delayed to the 22nd century, and the switch from carbon sink to carbon source is delayed from the 2050s to the 2170s. Coastal wetland loss is slowed. Stabilisation at 750 ppm generally has relatively little effect on the impacts of climate change on water resource stress, and populations at risk of hunger or falciparum malaria until the 2080s.A pathway which stabilises CO2 concentrations at 550 ppm by the 2170s delays the 2050 temperature increase under unmitigated emissions by around 100 years. There is no substantial loss of tropical forest or grassland, even by the 2230s, although the terrestrial carbon store ceases to act as a net carbon sink by around 2170 (this time because the vegetation has reached a new equilibrium with the atmosphere). Coastal wetland loss is slowed considerably, and the increase in coastal flood risk is considerably lower than under unmitigated emissions. CO2 stabilisation at 550 ppm reduces substantially water resource stress, relative to unmitigated emissions, but has relatively little impact on populations at risk of falciparum malaria, and may even cause more people to be at risk of hunger. While this study shows that mitigation avoids many impacts, particularly in the longer-term (beyond the 2080s), stabilisation at 550 ppm appears to be necessary to avoid or significantly reduce most of the projected impacts in the unmitigated case.'

Abstract: 'An hypothesis tout court is proposed to account for the association of cicadas (Homoptera: Cicadidae) with large-sized trees of the family Leguminosae in both climax forest formations and forest remnants in Central America. Based upon extensive field studies of these insects in Costa Rica, final-instar nymphal skins of many genera and species of Neotropical cicadas appear to be aggregated annually around individual large legume trees in a broad range of habitats in Costa Rica, and much of the reproductive behavior of the adult insects is also centered around these trees. A series of testable subhypotheses are generated based largely upon the assumption that cicadas, primarily through egg-placement behavior and nymphal feeding behavior, have coevolved with legume trees in climax forest formations of Central America, and perhaps elsewhere in the Neotropical Region. The \xe2\x80\x9croot crowns\xe2\x80\x9d of such trees, with some exceptions, might be optimal feeding sites for cicada nymphs in tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'Spongillida (Porifera) colonized temporary freshwater bodies at the global level. To enhance colonization, survival, long-term persistence, and dispersal, most continental sponges display cryptobiosis as dormancy of resting bodies, i.e. asexual gemmules, 0.25\xe2\x80\x931\xc2\xa0mm in diameter, containing staminal cells protected by a collagenous theca usually armed by siliceous skeletal spicules. High plasticity of body plan, physiology, life cycle, and reproductive modes are the key adaptive strategies of these sponges. The life cycle rhythm is characterized by the alternation of vegetative (active sponges) and cryptobiotic phases (dormant clones of gemmules). Hibernation or aestivation occurs cyclically according to the species and the environmental constraints of local hydrographic and climatic regimes. Ontogenetic constraints, e.g. chronic morphogenesis and clonal strategy by staminal cells, support a metamorphic process transforming the mother sponge functional body into gemmules (gemmulation) and vice versa (regeneration of the active sponge). During dormancy, the majority of these sponges are represented only by gemmules adhering to hard substrata, floating at the water surface, resting in the silty/sandy bottoms, or dispersing by flooding, animal carriers, and wind. A double functional role is performed by clonal gemmules to persist in situ and for dispersal in discontinuous continental water both in time and space.'

Abstract: 'Dogs and cats in Brazil serve as primary hosts for a considerable number of parasites, which may affect their health and wellbeing. These may include endoparasites (e.g., protozoa, cestodes, trematodes, and nematodes) and ectoparasites (i.e., fleas, lice, mites, and ticks). While some dog and cat parasites are highly host-specific (e.g., Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Felicola subrostratus for cats, and Angiostrongylus vasorum and Trichodectes canis for dogs), others may easily switch to other hosts, including humans. In fact, several dog and cat parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii, Dipylidium caninum, Ancylostoma caninum, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Toxocara canis) are important not only from a veterinary perspective but also from a medical standpoint. In addition, some of them (e.g., Lynxacarus radovskyi on cats and Rangelia vitalii in dogs) are little known to most veterinary practitioners working in Brazil. This article is a compendium on dog and cat parasites in Brazil and a call for a One Health approach towards a better management of some of these parasites, which may potentially affect humans. Practical aspects related to the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitic diseases of dogs and cats in Brazil are discussed.'

Abstract: 'This research characterized the feeding ecology of the fish community of the upper-middle course of Paraitinga River, located within the Upper Tiet\xc3\xaa River Basin, a peculiar Atlantic Forest area, regarded as a hotspot for fish conservation. Considering the several anthropogenic modifications, knowledge of the trophic structure might contribute to a better understanding of the factors that maintain the present fish community. Fish were collected with electrofishing equipment at 16 sites with different riparian vegetation, including native forest, secondary forest, pasture, and Eucalyptus, during the dry and rainy season of 2004/2005. Results obtained for 15 species indicated a predominance of insectivores and herbivore-detritivores along the course and an increase of total biomass, specifically of the herbivores-detritivores at the pasture sites, which seemed to be mediated by specific habitat features, which included open canopy, high water speed, and deeper areas. Strategies of resource use indicated that 47% of total combination pairs showed high overlap, but competition seemed to be minimized through low co-occurrence, spatial segregation, and abundance of food resources. Niche width was broad for all species, with no significant differences occurring among sites, seasons, and upper and lower course. With regard to the ongoing modifications in riparian zone conditions in this area, the implications of these findings for regional biodiversity conservation are discussed.'

Abstract: ' The litter ant fauna was sampled by Winkler sacks and pitfall traps along transects running through Atlantic rain forest into an adjacent grassland. Transects ran 65m into the forest and 45m into the field. Ninety-seven species of ants were sampled and scored, 85 were found in the forest, 48 were found in the field and 36 were common to both habitats. There was some evidence that species richness was lowest in the field and high at the deepest point within the forest. The composition of the ant community at the different distances into the forest and field was analysed by a number of hierarchical clustering procedures and also by ordinating the data in three-dimensional space. A two-way table of the ant assemblages derived from the clustering procedure versus the groupings of transect distances obtained by the same procedure indicated that certain ant species had preferences for the field or particular distances into the forest. It is concluded that although the ant fauna of Atlantic rain forest is severely affected by clearing, a forest-like ant fauna is able to persist right up to the interior edge of the forest.'

Abstract: ' Rinorea, the second most species-rich genus in the Violaceae, has been shown to be polyphyletic with four separate clades recovered in phylogenetic studies. Among these clades is the Rinorea crenata group, which is composed of three Neotropical species. This group has been shown in family- and genus-level molecular phylogenies to be resolved outside of a large clade representing Rinorea s.str. Based on phylogenetic, morphological, and anatomical evidence, Bribria, a new genus, is segregated from Rinorea s.str. and described, with new combinations made for its three species: Bribria apiculata, Bribria crenata, and Bribria oraria. In addition, two new sections in Rinorea s.str. are described to accommodate the remaining Neotropical species: Rinorea sect. Rinorea and Rinorea sect. Pubiflora, which correspond to Group IIa Rinorea and Group IIc Pubiflora, respectively, in W. H. A. Hekking\xe2\x80\x99s monograph of Neotropical Rinorea.'

Abstract: 'Secondary succession in tropical deciduous forest is often characterized by vegetative reproduction, or coppicing. Coppicing is also observed in forest sites that are disturbed by farming activity. This observation raises questions about the role of established management practices in determining the succession of vegetation on farmsites once they are abandoned to fallow. To what extent is the coppicing succession the result of specific aspects of swidden farming technology and management? And what variations in coppice successions occur in swidden sites following deviations from the standard farming practice? In research on swidden farming among the Susu of Sierra Leone, I examined the successional pathway in an age series of forest fallow sites. I show that the standard pattern of minimal cultivation favors the coppicing of felled trees in the subsequent fallow periods. By contrast, deviation from this pattern results in stump deaths and favors the invasion of fallow sites by grasses and vegetatively reproducing pioneer trees from the savanna. Variations in the environmental outcome of disturbance to plant communities, then, are the result of interactions between processes of tropical tree reproduction and the agricultural practices of local farmers.'

Abstract: 'Lignocellulose is a term for plant materials that are composed of matrices of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Lignocellulose is a renewable feedstock for many industries. Lignocellulosic materials are used for the production of paper, fuels, and chemicals. Typically, industry focuses on transforming the polysaccharides present in lignocellulose into products resulting in the incomplete use of this resource. The materials that are not completely used make up the underutilized streams of materials that contain cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These underutilized streams have potential for conversion into valuable products. Treatment of these lignocellulosic streams with bacteria, which specifically degrade lignocellulose through the action of enzymes, offers a low-energy and low-cost method for biodegradation and bioconversion. This review describes lignocellulosic streams and summarizes different aspects of biological treatments including the bacteria isolated from lignocellulose-containing environments and enzymes which may be used for bioconversion. The chemicals produced during bioconversion can be used for a variety of products including adhesives, plastics, resins, food additives, and petrochemical replacements.'

Abstract: 'Changes with time in the fertility of a Mexican ultisol were evaluated from analyses of soil samples from fields representing 50 years of pineapple slash-and-burn agriculture. Sixteen fields with similar soil profile charactersitics representing eight ages of forest fallow were sampled. The fields, within an area of 5 km2 of nearly level tropical forest, had been cleared by hand, initially intercropped with corn and manioc, followed with 3 to 4 y of pineapple, and then abandoned.'

Abstract: 'An improved understanding of important soil carbon (C) and nutrient pools as well as microbial activities in forest ecosystems is required for developing effective forest management regimes underpinning forest productivity and sustainability. Forest types and management practices can have significant impacts on soil C and nutrient pools as well as biological properties in forest ecosystems. Soil C and nutrient pools were assessed for adjacent natural forest (NF), first rotation (1R) (50-year-old), and second rotation (2R) (1-year-old) hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D. Don) plantations in southeast Queensland of subtropical Australia.'

Abstract: 'In this study, sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate supplemented with different proportions of sugar-ethanol industrial waste (vinasse) was used to optimize fermentative ethanol production using two Spathaspora passalidarum yeast strains isolated from decaying wood in Amazonian biome. The bagasse samples were pretreated chemically and enzymatically before using a binary factorial experimental design. The factorial design was carried out in two stages; in the first, a 24 factorial design was done to assess the effects of pretreated sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate and vinasse, ammonium sulfate concentration, yeast biomass concentration, and two different strains of yeast, S. passalidarum; in the second stage, a 23 factorial design was done to provide a more detailed analysis of the effects of vinasse supplementation on the fermentation process\xe2\x80\x94this time, by modifying the ratio of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate and vinasse and, more significantly, the same factor\xe2\x80\x94biomass concentration. The results showed that the most significant factors for increasing bioethanol production in the 24 factorial design proved to be the following: inoculum and hydrolyzed bagasse supplementation with vinasse (the optimal being 75:25), followed by yeast concentration (optimal at 14% w/v cell wet weight) and then the type of strain used (S. passalidarum UFMG-HMD-14.1). The use of only hydrolyzed bagasse without vinasse (23 factorial design) had no significant influence on the results, nor did varying the concentration of nitrogen. This increase in ethanol production, which allows the same amount of ethanol productivity through a reduction in the carbon source, suggests it can lead to an improved final use for vinasse.'

Abstract: 'Great biodiversity is a highlight of Brazilian flora. In contrast, the therapeutic potentialities of most species used in folk medicine remain unknown. Several of these species are commonly used to treat cancer. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic activity of 18 plants from 16 families that are found in the northeast region of Brazil.'

Abstract: 'Restoration of degraded swamps often requires strong human intervention because of their fragility. In Brazil, coastal swamp forests are now much reduced by anthropogenic action. This paper investigates survival and growth performance of nine native shrub and tree species introduced into a degraded swamp invaded by exotic grasses and sedges in coastal Rio de Janeiro. Our central aim was to evaluate which species were more appropriate for use in initial stages of revegetation. Additionally, in separate field experiments, we tested statistical hypotheses that higher survival and growth performance would be found for seedlings: (a) taller in height, (b) subjected to shorter duration of flooding, and (c) planted with addition of organic matter inside the planting holes. Results were analyzed after 3\xc2\xa0years of planting. \xe2\x80\x9cPlanting in mounds\xe2\x80\x9d, and a consequent reduction on the flooding period plants are exposed to, increased survival and growth. The use of taller seedlings often increased survival, and organic matter addition increased growth. Three (Myrsine rubra, Tabebuia cassinoides, and Calyptranthes brasiliensis) out of nine species tested showed high growth- and use-viability indices, and were therefore indicated for use in revegetation programs. Interspecific variation as regards responses to the treatments applied suggests that in the future, species evaluated for this purpose, should be examined on a case-by-case basis.'

Abstract: 'The feeding niche ofColostethus stepheni changes during ontogeny. Small individuals eat small arthropods, principally mites and collembolans, and larger frogs eat bigger prey of other types. The shift in prey types is not a passive effect of selection for bigger prey. There is a strong relationship between electivity for prey types and frog size, independent of electivity for prey size. Four indices of general activity during foraging (number of movements, velocity, total area utilized and time spent moving), which are associated with electivity for prey types in adult frogs and lizards, did not predict the ontogenetic change in the diet ofC. stepheni. Apparently, the behavioral changes that cause the ontogenetic change inC. stepheni are more subtle than shifts in general activity during foraging. Studies of niche partitioning in communities of anurans that do not take into consideration ontogenetic changes in diet and seasonal changes in the size structures of populations present a partial and possibly erroneous picture of the potential interactions among species.'

Abstract: 'The Caribbean coast of Central America remains an area of malaria transmission caused by Plasmodium falciparum despite the fact that morbidity has been reduced in recent years. Parasite populations in that region show interesting characteristics such as chloroquine susceptibility and low mortality rates. Genetic structure and diversity of P. falciparum populations in the Honduras-Nicaragua border were analysed in this study.'

Abstract: 'A review of recent research on complex hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherers in North America suggests that age-old tensions between evolutionary and historical epistemologies continue to cultivate progress in anthropological understanding of sociocultural variation. Coupled with criticism of the evolutionary status of ethnographic foragers, archaeological documentation of variation among hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherer societies of the ancient past makes it difficult to generalize about causal relationships among environment, subsistence economy, and sociopolitical organization. Explanations for emergent complexity on the Pacific Coast that privilege environmental triggers for economic change have been challenged by new paleoenvironmental findings, while hypotheses suggesting that economic changes were preceded by, indeed caused by, transformations of existing structures of social inequality have gained empirical support. In its emergent data on mound construction apart from significant subsistence change, the southeastern United States gives pause to materialist explanations for complexity, turning the focus on symbolic and structural dimensions of practice that cannot be understood apart from particular histories of group interaction and tradition. Taken together, recent research on complex hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherers in North America has not only expanded the empirical record of sociocultural formations once deemed anomalous and/or derivative of European contact but also has contributed to the ongoing process of clarifying concepts of cultural complexity and how this process ultimately restructures anthropological theory.'

Abstract: ' Genetic diversity appears to be unaffected by disturbance in a stand of the light-demanding Neotropical tree V. michelii. Although spatial genetic structure is modified in post-disturbance cohorts, mixing of seeds from different mother trees in canopy gaps appears to efficiently maintain genetic admixture. '

Abstract: 'The tropical genus Thamnomyces is characterized by having wiry, black, brittle stromata and early deliquescent asci, lacking an amyloid apical apparatus. Thamnomyces is regarded as a member of the Xylariaceae because the morphology of its ascospores and the anamorphic structures are typical for this family. However, its relationship to other xylariaceous genera remained to be clarified. Cultures of three Thamnomyces species were obtained and studied for morphological characters, and their secondary metabolite profiles as inferred from high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric and diode array detection (HPLC\xe2\x80\x93MS/DAD) were also compared. Cultures of Thamnomyces closely resembled those of the genera Daldinia and Phylacia and even produced several secondary metabolite families that are known to be chemotaxonomic markers for the aforementioned genera. These findings were corroborated by a comparison of their 5.8S/ITS nrDNA sequences. We conclude that Thamnomyces, Daldinia, and Phylacia are derived from the same evolutionary lineage, despite these genera differing drastically in their stromatal morphology and anatomy. Along with Entonaema and Rhopalostoma, these fungi comprise an evolutionarily derived lineage of the hypoxyloid Xylariaceae. A new species of Thamnomyces is erected, and preliminary descriptions of three further, potentially new taxa are also provided.'

Abstract: "The reintroduction of plants will become an increasingly utilized strategy in plant conservation and protected area management. Reintroduction is the deliberate establishment of individuals of a species into an area and/or habitat where it has become extirpated with the specific aim of establishing a viable self-sustaining population for conservation purposes. Plant reintroduction can involve the establishment of an extirpated species into a relatively intact habitat or it can be part of the restoration of a degraded habitat. This will be performed as species become extinct for a number of reasons, such as collecting, introduced herbivores or pathogens and potentially climate change. Although plant reintroductions have the potential to play an important role in species' conservation the long term viability of many reintroductions has yet to be assessed. For the technique to reach it's full potential it requires greater integration with habitat management, restoration and increased international coordination between both theex situ andin situ agencies. In addition the value of introducing stocks of endangered species lacking viable sites for reintroduction to non native sites is discussed."

Abstract: 'Tissue culture in Passiflora has emerged as a strategy to propagate species with agronomic relevance, which is the main focus of most in vitro studies. Different morphogenic responses have been obtained under the same environmental in vitro conditions, mainly for species of the subgenus Passiflora with distinct 2n chromosome numbers. The aims of this study were to verify and compare the in vitro responses in Passiflora species with distinct 2n chromosome numbers, ploidy levels and nuclear 2C values. Under the same in vitro conditions, only friable calli occurred from mature zygotic embryo explants of Passiflora coriacea (2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8912 chromosomes, 2C\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.00\xc2\xa0pg), Passiflora lindeniana (2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8924, 2C\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.42\xc2\xa0pg) and Passiflora contracta (2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x898x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8948, 2C\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894.78\xc2\xa0pg). In contrast, plantlets were regenerated from Passiflora foetida (2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8920, 2C\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.04\xc2\xa0pg) and Passiflora miniata (2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8918, 2C\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893.40\xc2\xa0pg) via indirect organogenesis and indirect somatic embryogenesis, respectively. By now, from mature zygotic embryo explants, de novo shoot organogenesis and somatic embryos have been recovered for Passiflora species with 2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8918 chromosomes and relative high nuclear 2C value (more than 2C\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.93 pg\xe2\x80\x94Passiflora cincinata), and only de novo shoot organogenesis for P. foetida with 2n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8920 chromosomes and relative low 2C value (2C\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.04\xc2\xa0pg). Therefore, in a taxonomic and evolutive context, this study showed that the in vitro morphogenic pathways pretty varied between the Passiflora species with distinct karyotype features.'

Abstract: 'Of what value are forest fragments to the conservation of the tropical rain forest diversity for a landscape? We compared the changes in composition, diversity, and plant structure of 15 small (1\xe2\x80\x9376\xc2\xa0ha) relatively unprotected forest fragments with those of a large (700\xc2\xa0ha) well protected fragment (LWPF) in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. The trees, shrubs, lianas, palms, and herbs with dbh\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x892.5\xc2\xa0cm were sampled in 1000\xc2\xa0m2 at each site. For each ecological group (based on light requirements for germination: primary, secondary, and non-secondary light demanding, NSLD, species) and life form, estimates of species diversity, density, and basal area were analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression to determine whether there were any relationships between these variables and fragment characteristics (size, shape index, and isolation). The composition and plant structure of LWPF were different from those of the small fragments and large trees are absent from the canopy of the latter. Fragment size best explained the differences in composition and plant structure. Species composition in the largest fragments was similar to that of LWPF, but there was no significant difference in total richness between LWPF and the fragments, even though both the richness and abundance of secondary and NSLD species did differ. LWPF had more large primary trees in the canopy, and a greater abundance and basal area of palms and herbs. For tropical rain forest conservation, it is important to maintain the greatest possible number of large fragments and establish policies that prevent forest remnants from being further reduced in size and increasingly isolated from each other.'

Abstract: 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and enhancing \xe2\x80\x9cremovals of greenhouse gas emissions by forests\xe2\x80\x9d in developing countries through positive incentives is regarded as an essential component of the post-2012 climate regime for stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions and an important way of engaging developing countries in global mitigation efforts. We aimed to evaluate the potential effectiveness of REDD+ by integrating it into a land use option framework. One of our goals was to develop scenarios for evaluating the impacts of land use changes on carbon and environmental processes. In addition, we aimed to quantify the potential economic benefits to society of compensated reductions and to identify hotspots for applying REDD+. Three land use change scenarios were examined: (I) business as usual (BAU), (II) economic development, and (III) REDD+. A case study in Indonesia was examined using these land use scenarios and policy interventions, evaluating their effects on carbon emissions, socioeconomics, and environmental features of a spatial system using land use models. Significant emissions and water erosion reductions were predicted to be achieved under the REDD+ scenario, due to reduced deforestation of <6% over the next decade; >0.14 Mt CO2e reduction was predicted relative to the BAU scenario. Furthermore, the spatial land use model indicated that REDD+ payments of forest carbon credits in the compliance market would play a key role in compensating rural communities and plantation companies for their opportunity cost in ending deforestation. This study provides an example of integrating land use modeling with a scenario analysis framework to evaluate plausible future forecasts and to evaluate the potential impacts of REDD+.'

Abstract: 'The present study aimed to understand human plant resource usage strategies in the context of the Ecological Apparency Hypothesis and Optimal Foraging Theory. The relationship between plant resource knowledge and availability was tested in a rural community (Palmital) in a dry Atlantic Forest fragment in the state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil, using data from phytosociological studies and interviews. We considered both total use and separate use categories. Use Value (UV) was significantly associated with all of the analyzed ecological variables, but there was an association with relative dominance and a weak relationship with relative density. When the UVs were separately analyzed for each category, we found that some, i.e., fuel and construction, corroborate the Ecological Apparency Hypothesis, while others do not, particularly the medicinal and food categories. In addition, we found large differences with respect to the ecological variables that best correlated with UV. The data suggest that the cost/benefit relationship predicted by Optimal Foraging Theory can explain the Ecological Apparency Hypothesis when the following factors are considered: (a) resource acquisition optimization and security; (b) a higher probability of acquiring more abundant species during random collection events; and (c) differential utilization patterns (distinct requirements for a specific use) for each use category. Some implications for conservation are also discussed.'

Abstract: 'In the highlands of northern Ethiopia, remnants of the original Afromontane forest vegetation are largely restricted to church yards and other sacred groves in a matrix of cropland and semiarid degraded savanna. To assess the potential for natural forest regeneration, species composition and diversity of all forest fragments (10) in a study area of 13,000\xc2\xa0ha were analyzed in relation to environmental and soil variables. Using a random design and a density of approximately one plot per 2\xc2\xa0ha in all fragments, 31 20\xc3\x9720\xc2\xa0m plots were sampled. Indicator species analysis and MRPP tests yielded five communities representing two forest types and one degraded savanna habitat. The forest fragments had a species-poor tree and shrub community in which plots were rather homogeneous and most species abundant. NMDS and analysis of variance indicated that a topographical gradient correlated to soil phosphorus, soil depth, stoniness and the proximity to the river system explained the major differences in species composition and separated moist and dry Afromontane forest communities. The grazing intensity further partitioned the habitats. Present communities and their environmental correlates indicate that the secondary climax forest in the area probably consisted of dry Afromontane forest interlaced by broad strips of moist Afromontane forest along rivers and streams and not a continuous, mono-dominant Juniperus forest as is often presumed. Negative effects of the degraded matrix on forest fragments increased with decreasing patch area and increasing shape irregularity. Nevertheless, all remaining fragments are important for their role in the landscape ecology of the region as refuges and species pools and should be protected and managed accordingly. If seed dispersal from forest fragments into exclosures and subsequent tree recruitment are both successful, the vegetation type most likely to establish is Afromontane savanna woodland, and if managed properly, eventually dry Afromontane forest may arise. Increasing the size of small patches and placing forest plantations and exclosures in the vicinity of small forest fragments is expected to yield the most immediate results. This approach may increase the likelihood of patch colonisation by frugivorous forest birds and thus foster the regeneration of native woody species.'

Abstract: 'Although conservation attention has generally focused on large forest tracts, there is increasing evidence that smaller forest patches are important for both conservation and rural development. A study of forest patch conservation in a rural Costa Rican community found that, although forest patch conservation was influenced by landholding size, material factors did not account for all the variation in forest patches conservation behavior or conservation orientations of farmers. A qualitative interpretive approach, using semi-structured interviews, found that environmental values were influenced by at least three factors. First, colonist farmers with direct experience with environmental degradation in other regions of Costa Rica were more likely to be concerned about environmental degradation. Second, childhood exposure to conservation played an important role in influencing conservation orientations. Third, the environment was frequently discussed in relation to the moral and social values present in religious doctrines. The study also found general support for forest conservation laws, and a clear indication that interest in forest conservation has grown in recent years. The study highlights the importance of environmental values, in conjunction with material factors, in influencing forest conservation in rural communities.'

Abstract: 'Variation in photosynthetic parameters was observed between eight contrasting cacao (Theobroma cacao) genotypes. Net photosynthetic rate (PN) ranged from 3.4 to 5.7 \xce\xbcmol(CO2) m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 for the genotypes IMC 47 and SCA 6, respectively. Furthermore, genotypic differences were detected in quantum efficiency ranging from 0.020 to 0.043 \xce\xbcmol(CO2) \xce\xbcmol\xe2\x88\x921(photon) for UF 676 and AMAZ 15/15, respectively. Differences in PN were correlated with both stomatal conductance (gs) and leaf nitrogen per unit area. Some variation in water use efficiency was observed between genotypes, both intrinsic (PN/gs) and instantaneous (PN/transpiration rate). Both measures of water use efficiency were a negative function of specific leaf area. Evidence was found for a trade-off mechanism between cacao genotypes in photosynthesis and leaf structure. High photosynthetic rate, expressed on a mass basis was associated with smaller leaves. Furthermore, thinner leaves were compensated for by a higher nitrogen content per unit mass.'

Abstract: '\nThe jaguar Panthera onca requires large areas of relatively intact habitats containing adequate amounts of prey to survive. Since a substantial portion of jaguar range occurs outside of strict protected areas, there is a need for economic incentives for habitat conservation, which carefully managed selective logging can provide. Forest Stewardship Council and Pan European Forest Council certifications intended to regulate wood extraction to maintain the ecological functions of forests require evidence of biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. We draw on twelve surveys across four countries and a range of biomes to present evidence that adequate logging management can maintain jaguar populations, but that they are at risk without efficient control of secondary impacts of access and hunting. Where resident, the presence of jaguars can serve as an indication that the ecological requirements of certified timber extraction are being met. We present a gradient of rigor for monitoring, recommending cost-effective options.\n'

Abstract: "Efforts to stimulate more intensive land use must be based on a solid understanding of current farmer strategies and the factors that drive them. This paper discusses the influences on agricultural strategy among farmers in Pet\xc3\xa9n, Guatemala, and more specifically, their adoption of more intensive practices. Existing theoretical frameworks pertaining to agricultural intensification are based on a limited number of explanatory variables and thus provide an incomplete understanding of farmer strategy and of how and why it varies among farmers and communities. A more useful analytical approach is to consider the wide range of factors at both the regional/community scale and the farm/household scale that influence farmers' need, desire, and ability to alter their production strategies. An analysis based on this approach indicates that conservation and development organizations in Pet\xc3\xa9n should place greater emphasis on the rural economy and on fostering the conditions that would stimulate more intensive, sustainable land use."

Abstract: " Because the world's forests play a major role in regulating nutrient and carbon cycles, there is much interest in estimating their biomass. Estimates of aboveground biomass based on well-established methods are relatively abundant; estimates of root biomass based on standard methods are much less common. The goal of this work was to determine if a reliable method to estimate root biomass density for forests could be developed based on existing data from the literature. The forestry literature containing root biomass measurements was reviewed and summarized and relationships between both root biomass density (Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921) and root:shoot ratios (R/S) as dependent variables and various edaphic and climatic independent variables, singly and in combination, were statistically tested. None of the tested independent variables of aboveground biomass density, latitude, temperature, precipitation, temperature:precipitation ratios, tree type, soil texture, and age had important explanatory value for R/S. However, linear regression analysis showed that aboveground biomass density, age, and latitudinal category were the most important predictors of root biomass density, and together explained 84% of the variation. A comparison of root biomass density estimates based on our equations with those based on use of generalized R/S ratios for forests in the United States indicated that our method tended to produce estimates that were about 20% higher."

Abstract: 'The Choco jet is an important atmospheric feature of Colombian and northern South America hydro-climatology. This work assesses the ability of 26 coupled and 11 uncoupled (AMIP) global climate models (GCMs) included in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive to simulate the climatological basic features (annual cycle, spatial distribution and vertical structure) of this jet. Using factor and cluster analysis, we objectively classify models in Best, Worst, and Intermediate groups. Despite the coarse resolution of the GCMs, this study demonstrates that nearly all models can represent the existence of the Choco low-level jet. AMIP and Best models present a more realistic simulation of jet. Worst models exhibit biases such as an anomalous southward location of the Choco jet during the whole year and a shallower jet. The model skill to represent this jet comes from their ability to reproduce some of its main causes, such as the temperature and pressure differences between particular regions in the eastern Pacific and western Colombian lands, which are non-local features. Conversely, Worst models considerably underestimate temperature and pressure differences between these key regions. We identify a close relationship between the location of the Choco jet and the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and CMIP5 models are able to represent such relationship. Errors in Worst models are related with bias in the location of the ITCZ over the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, as well as the representation of the topography and the horizontal resolution.'

Abstract: 'The pollination systems of two closely related genera.Cyphomandra andSolanum, differ in rewards offered and pollinator activity. I suggest that the anther differences which define these two genera have evolved in response to the different pollination systems. Male euglossine bees of the genusEufriesea were observed to pollinate the flowers ofCyphomandra endopogon var.endopogon while gathering aromatic compounds from the anther connectives. Samples of the compound collected from the flowers and the bees were tentatively identified as ocimene, a terpene.'

Abstract: 'Most of us in the Western world are accustomed to learning about the world primarily through our senses of sight and hearing. Despite a few interesting experiments in the education of the "lower" senses, smell, taste and touch have not been accorded a place in mainstream Western education. These senses tend to be associated either with "savagery" or sensualism. When we look across cultures, however, a different sensory picture emerges, in which each of the senses has a vital role to play in the acquisition of knowledge of the world. The example is taken of the Desana people of the Colombian rainforest. For the Desana the sound of every bird call, the colour and scent of every flower, the taste of every fruit is imbued with a message about the social and cosmic order. The Desana remind us in the modern West that knowledge does not just come from books and computers, it comes from the full-bodied experience and interpretation of our environment.'

Abstract: 'This article contributes a brief review of the ethnobotany and ontogeny ofHeteropsis spp. (Araceae), reports the distribution and density of Heteropsis spp. in a tropical lowland rainforest in southern Venezuela, and explores the environmental variables that correlate best with the observedHeteropsis densities.Heteropsis occurred on 26% of the 4091 trees (\xe2\x89\xa510 cm DBH) inventoried in 67 plots (of 0.1 hectare, each). Mean Heteropsis colonization densities differed significantly between 11 local forest types and ranged from 0% (in seasonally deeply flooded forest and in semideciduous hill forest) to 74% (in sporadically flooded forest near small streams). Across forest types,Heteropsis occurred on a significantly greater number of trees between 20 and 50 cm DBH than expected for an even distribution over all size classes. Of the 90 most common potential host species in the plots, the giant herb Phenakospermum guyannense (L. C. Rich.) Endl. was the only one consistently and significantly avoided by Heteropsis, and no host species was significantly preferred across all forest types. Heteropsis densities were positively correlated with the depth of the fine root mat and the diversity of big lianas. They were negatively correlated with the concentration of exchangeable potassium, flooding depth, and the density of small lianas. We conclude that Heteropsis shows clear habitat preferences that reflect site differences in soil fertility, flooding regime and forest structure and could not be explained by the distribution of preferred or avoided host tree sizes or species.'

Abstract: 'This is a continuity of a series of taxonomic papers where materials are examined, described and novel combinations are proposed where necessary to improve our traditional species concepts and provide updates on their classification. In addition to extensive morphological descriptions and appropriate asexual and sexual connections, DNA sequence data are also analysed from concatenated datasets (rDNA, TEF-\xce\xb1, RBP2 and \xce\xb2-Tubulin) to infer phylogenetic relationships and substantiate systematic position of taxa within appropriate ranks.

Abstract: "Afforestation is considered an important option for mitigation of greenhousegas emissions. Recently, plantation projects have been suggested for inclusionunder the Clean Development Mechanism. While considered a cheap option,significant uncertainties make it difficult to determine the (net) carbonbenefits and profitability of forestry projects. The current uncertaintiesabout the regulatory framework of the CDM and the environmental and economicperformance of plantation forestry could create uncertainties with respect tothe additionality of such projects and thus their acceptance under themechanism.Six plantation forestry projects that were proposed in Brazil have been usedas cases to study sources of uncertainty for carbon benefits and economics forsuch projects. These cases vary widely in terms of productivity and productsdelivered. A quantitative model for calculating greenhouse gas balances andfinancial benefits and costs, taking a broad range of variables into account,was developed. Data from the developers of the proposed projects was used asmain source material. Subsequently, scenario's were evaluated, containingdifferent and realistic options for baseline vegetation, carbon creditingsystems and CDM modalities, fluctuations in product prices, discount rates andcarbon prices.The real cost of combined carbon sequestration and substitution for the caseprojects was below $3 per ton of carbon avoided, when based exclusivelyon data supplied by project developers. However, potential variations incarbon impact and costs based on scenario options were very large. Differentbaseline vegetation or adopting a different discount rate cause carbon creditsto vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Different carbon crediting systemsor fluctuations in (commodity) product prices cause variations up to200% in carbon credits and NPV. This makes the additionality of suchprojects difficult to determine. Five of the six case projects seem uneligiblefor development under the CDM. A critical attitude towards the use ofplantation projects under the CDM seems justified."

Abstract: 'The Chiado\xe2\x80\x99s fire that affected the city centre of Lisbon (Portugal) occurred on 25th August 1988 and had a significant human and environmental impact. This fire was considered the most significant hazard to have occurred in Lisbon city centre after the major earthquake of 1755. A clear signature of this fire is found in the atmospheric electric field data recorded at Portela meteorological station about 8\xc2\xa0km NE from the site where the fire started at Chiado. Measurements were made using a Benndorf electrograph with a probe at 1-m height. The atmospheric electric field reached 510\xc2\xa0V/m when the wind direction was coming from SW to NE, favourable to the transport of the smoke plume from Chiado to Portela. Such observations agree with predictions using Hysplit air mass trajectory modelling and have been used to estimate the smoke concentration to be ~0.4\xc2\xa0mg/m3. It is demonstrated that atmospheric electric field measurements were therefore extremely sensitive to Chiado\xe2\x80\x99s fire. This result is of particular current interest in using networks of atmospheric electric field sensors to complement existing optical and meteorological observations for fire monitoring.'

Abstract: 'This article explores the role of conventions in the normalization of cocoa production in Ecuadorian Amazonia. Convention theory provides key theoretical tools for understanding coordination among agents. However, conventions must be understood as cultural constructions with a strong Eurocentric background that must be substantially modified in originally non-European contexts. A creative application of convention theory can partially overcome bifurcation among Western and non-Western rationalities. First, it shows that Western values and forms of coordination are heterogeneous, conflictive and opposing. Second, it provides key insight for understanding the transformation of subaltern subjectivities generated from non-Western rationalities that are closely associated with subjugated knowledges. Third, in applying the concept of compromise, it allows one to understand cognitive hybridization and coordination among indigenous and Western agents and thus the complexities of processes of resistance, subversion and empowerment carried by indigenous communities. This article is focused on how cocoa production in Ecuadorian Amazonia serves as an example of the confluence and coordination of indigenous (using the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cGood Living\xe2\x80\x9d or Sumak Kawsay) and Western conventions. The assertion of Sumak Kawsay is understood as a relevant transformation of Ecuadorian post-colonial relations. It is shown that relevant industrial upgrading processes are justified by, among others, Sumak Kawsay repertoires. Additionally, dialogue on knowledge and compromise among conventions, and especially concerning Sumak Kawsay and the market, have been key facets shaping the development of a differentiated quality strand that has promoted relevant changes in the subaltern positioning of indigenous farmers in the cocoa commodity chain.'

Abstract: 'After standardizing global land climate gridded data from the Climatic Research Unit TS (time-series) 3.1 dataset for the period 1901\xe2\x80\x932009, cluster analysis is used to objectively classify world climates into 14 climate types. These climate types establish a baseline classification map and the types are named according to K\xc3\xb6ppen\xe2\x80\x93Geiger climate classifications. Although the cluster analysis and K\xc3\xb6ppen classification methods are very different, the distributions of climate types obtained by the two methods are similar. Moreover, the climate types we identify also coincide well with their corresponding vegetation types. Thus, cluster analysis can be used as an effective alternative to the K\xc3\xb6ppen classification method for classifying world climate types. The spatial and temporal changes in geographical distribution of global climate types were investigated in 25-year intervals, and Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s kappa coefficient is used to detect agreement between the periods. Globally, although an obvious trend in increasing global temperature is found, distribution of climate types overall show no distinct changes over the periods. However, at the regional scale, spatial change in distribution of climate types is evident in South America and Africa. In South America, larger areas of the \xe2\x80\x9cfully humid equatorial rainforest\xe2\x80\x9d (Af) and \xe2\x80\x9cequatorial savannah with dry winter\xe2\x80\x9d (Aw) climate types have changed types. In Africa, changes mainly occurred in the Af, \xe2\x80\x9cequatorial savannah with dry summer\xe2\x80\x9d (As), Aw, \xe2\x80\x9csteppe climate\xe2\x80\x9d (BS), and \xe2\x80\x9cdesert climate\xe2\x80\x9d (BW) climate types. Moreover, some climate types, including Af, \xe2\x80\x9cequatorial monsoon\xe2\x80\x9d (Am), BS, BW, and \xe2\x80\x9ctundra climate\xe2\x80\x9d (ET), were susceptible to temporal climate changes, especially in the period 1976\xe2\x80\x932009.'

Abstract: 'To evaluate the importance and fate of organic matter inputs in forested streams, we determined the litterfall inputs and the benthic coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) in one headwater stream flowing through a mixed deciduous forest, during one year. Both vertical traps and the stream bottom were sampled monthly. The material collected was sorted into four main categories: leaves, fruits and flowers, twigs and debris. Litter production was 715 g m\xe2\x88\x922 y\xe2\x88\x921 and seasonal, with 73% of the annual total during October\xe2\x80\x93December (autumn). Leaves comprised the largest litter component.

A total of 301 shrubs and tree species were present either in the forest or homegardens sampled; 222 species (73.7%) have at least one reported use. The species with more uses are: Bursera simaruba (10), Gliricidia sepium (10), Cordia dodecandra (9), Plumeria rubra (7), Caesalpinia gaumeri (7), Vitex gaumeri (7), Enterolobium cyclocarpum (7), and Piscidia piscipula (7). More species (152/69.7%) are classified for medical purposes, followed by apiculture (87/39.9%), food (66/30.3%), fuel (38/17.4%), building (41/18.8%) and timber (25/11.5%). Despite the lack of important commercial species (timber, fruit) in this type of tropical forest, we discuss the importance of the tropical dry forest of Yucat\xc3\xa1n as an area where management could lead to sustainable production of honey, deer and building material for houses.'

Abstract: 'The study of past human activities and their environmental effect is high in the agenda of global change research. A record of pollen assemblages is one of the most common proxies employed for detecting the impact of human activities on the landscape. In this review, we provide a summary and discussion on the recent progress on the use of pollen as indicators of human activity. For most of the studies related to human impact, the following features have been focused on: (1) decline of certain tree pollen; (2) flourishing of pioneer plant pollen; (3) concomitant occurrence of cereal-type pollen and cropland weed pollen; (4) abrupt changes in pollen concentration and richness; and (5) occurrence of nitrophilous plants and pastoral weed. Pollen of anthropogenic plants (weeds and cereal-type plants) is ideal indicators of human activities. Different types of human activities will result in different pollen assemblages. Patterns of human-impacted pollen spectra would vary between forested areas and grassland. In the study of human impact with pollen data, high resolution in both time and space must be considered. High resolution in space will help to inform the complexity of the landscape. More importantly, it can help to reveal the interference of human activities on the landscape, hence avoiding the bias created by the limited data points. Fine resolution in time will make accurate recording of short-lived events possible, hence avoiding the exclusion of events related to human activities. The combination of palynology with other proxies will help to decipher more accurately landscape changes through time. Charcoal is a particularly useful proxy for recording the disturbance of humans on vegetation. Its peak values usually occur with pronounced drop of tree pollen and significant rise of anthropogenic pollen.'

Abstract: 'Cocoa farming has been a major driver of deforestation in West Africa, notably in C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire, the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading cocoa producer. Cocoa has been a \xe2\x80\x9cpioneer crop\xe2\x80\x9d that was grown after forest clearing, and instead of replanting aging plantations, farmers usually migrated to the forest frontiers to establish a new cocoa farm. During the second half of the twentieth century, the cocoa frontier moved from the drier east to the wetter southwest of the country, fueled by massive immigration of prospective cocoa farmers from the savanna. It has been argued that the climate gradient was a major driver of these east\xe2\x80\x93west migrations and that cocoa farmers, by replacing forest with farm land over vast areas, contributed to the further drying of the climate in a positive feedback cycle. If this were the case, then a hotter and drier future climate would likely continue to push cocoa farmers into the wetter southwest of the sub-continent, with the last forest reserves of southwestern C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire and Liberia as the only remaining destinations. Based on an analysis of long-term rainfall measurements in major cocoa growing areas of C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire and interviews with cocoa farmers about their history and motives of migration, we argue that climate and drought have been supporting factors, but not usually the main drivers of cocoa migrations, which were mostly a response to the perceived availability of forest land for planting. We also show that the observed decrease in rainfall in the cocoa regions during the 1970s and 1980s was not primarily a response to local deforestation related to cocoa farming, although deforestation may have caused microclimatic changes. Climate extremes like the 1982/3 drought have also triggered adaptations of farming practices like replanting and crop diversification. To prevent cocoa farming from continuing to act as a driver of deforestation in a hotter climate, governments and supply chain actors should discourage forest frontier dynamics and should help cocoa farmers adapt to environmental change by adopting more intensive and diversified farming practices, building on farmers\xe2\x80\x99 own risk mitigation and adaptation strategies.'

Abstract: 'Sustained management of natural forest depends on their ability to regenerate. The pace at which older trees are replaced by younger ones is important in this respect. This study was conducted to assess the demographic details of natural regeneration dynamics of south Indian moist deciduous forests. The status of natural regeneration has been assessed in eight localities of varying levels of disturbance in Thrissur Forest Division of Kerala State of southwest India. Enumeration of trees and their regeneration were analyzed at three levels of organization; whole-stand, stratum, and species.'

Abstract: 'Some studies have attributed forest shrinkage to population growth, economic development, conversion of forest land to agricultural use and harvesting of trees for timber and fuelwood. But the statistical support for these hypotheses is not strong. This paper attempts to test the above hypotheses statistically in the case of Bangladesh. Factor analysis extracted 4 important factors\xe2\x80\x94(a) exploitation of forests for timber, fuelwood, tea, and shrimp production, (b) demographic pressure in agriculture, (c) economic development, and (d) expansion of crop lands\xe2\x80\x94as causes of deforestation. The statistical test supports the hypotheses that the exploitation of forests for timber, fuelwood, tea and shrimp production, and conversion of forests to crop lands have a negative influence on forest cover. Economic development and demographic pressure in agriculture are also negatively correlated with forest cover. Results of regression analysis show the conversion of forests to agricultural land is the most important cause of deforestation. Other important causes, in order of their relative importance, are the relative price of forest products, population growth, economic development, demographic pressure in agriculture, increasing production of shrimps, export of tea and shrimps, increasing production of timber and fuelwood, and expansion of tea lands. The statistical tests support the above relationships.'

Abstract: 'A study was undertaken around Mt Cameroon to examine the role of biological and cultural diversity in the livelihood strategies of indigenous villagers and migrants to the region. Surveys of resources consumed and sold by 118 households were undertaken in five villages over the course of 1\xc2\xa0year, the perspectives and practices of cocoa farmers documented, and useful tree species retained or planted on six cocoa farms mapped. Cocoa farms in this region generate more significant benefits for biodiversity conservation and local livelihoods than commercial plantations, but also place pressure on forest reserves and require chemical inputs. Roughly 50 tree species are commonly retained or planted on cocoa farms, primarily for timber or food, with many of these having high conservation value. Average tree density of non-cocoa trees was 15 trees per hectare, with tree densities higher, and a larger percentage of species used, on indigenous Bomboko farms than migrant farms. Both migrant and indigenous households rely on forest as a complement to farm income, but indigenous households do this to a far greater extent, while also making extensive use of fallow and home gardens. Indigenous households also derive roughly four times the income from wild and native species compared to migrants. While diversified cocoa farms contribute to conservation and livelihoods in the region, indigenous livelihoods grow from and require the conservation of a broader range of species and habitats, including natural forest.'

Abstract: 'The need for long-term biodiversity monitoring using standardized protocols led to the creation of the Tropical Ecology, Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) initiative. At some 50 field stations in tropical forests around the world, TEAM will monitor various taxa such as ants, birds, butterflies, medium and large terrestrial mammals, primates, litter fall, and trees, as well as landscape change in nine tropical biodiversity hotspots and three tropical wilderness areas. The TEAM terrestrial mammal program calls for using a grid of camera phototraps to monitor long-term trends in densities and occupancy rates of species that can or cannot be uniquely identified, respectively. We describe the TEAM camera phototrapping program and provide results for the first TEAM site\xe2\x80\x93Caxiuan\xc3\xa3 National Forest in northern Brazil. An intensive one year camera trapping effort was carried out to determine which months were most suitable for long-term monitoring. Fifteen species of medium and large terrestrial mammals and two large birds were recorded, including three xenarthrans, five carnivores, one perissodactyle, three artiodactyles, two rodents, and one marsupial. The medium and large terrestrial mammal diversity was well represented during two consecutive wet and dry months, respectively. We also recorded activity patterns for all species photographed by our camera traps more than 10 times.'

Abstract: 'Geophagy was observed 14 times during an 11-month field study on the ecology and behavior of masked titi monkeys (Callicebus personatus melanochir). Geophagy took place in 12 cases on the surface of a leaf-cutting ant mound (Atta spec.). Analysis of chemical composition and natural features of the soils consumed by the monkeys showed elevated concentrations of several elements. In contrast, a lower concentration of carbohydrates was found in the ant mound sample compared to random non-ant mound soil samples. No difference in the concentration of clay elements, pH-value or percentage of organic matter was found between ant mound samples and randomly collected soil samples. Comparison of used versus not used samples failed to reveal significant clues about function of geophagy. However, chemical and physical properties of soils ingested support previous hypothesis that this behavior may aid in the adsorbtion of plant toxins.'

Abstract: 'The Chinese Sun Hazemeter Network (CSHNET) provides the necessary ground-based observation to validate and assess the applicability of MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products over different ecological and geographic regions in China for the first time. The validation results show that the comprehensive utilization ratio and applicability of MODIS products varied very much over different regions and seasons from August 2004 to July 2005. On the Tibetan Plateau, the comprehensive utilization ratio of MODIS data was low: MODIS products only accounted for 16% of the ground-based observation; on average, 31% to 45% of MODIS products fell within the retrieval errors issued by NASA. A similar result was found in northern desert areas with the ratio of MODIS to observation ranging from 15% to 55%, with 7% to 39% of MODIS products within errors. In the remote northeast corner of China, low ratios of MODIS to observation were also found ranging from 14% to 46%, with 49% to 69% of MODIS within errors. The forested sites exhibited moderate ratios of MODIS to observation ranging from 46% to 65%, with 30% to 59% of MODIS within errors. This was similar to numbers observed at sites along eastern seashore of China and inland urban sites with the ratio of MODIS to observation between 63% to 75%, with 25% to 67% of MODIS within errors for sites along eastern seashore of China and 43% to 78%, with 35% to 75% of MODIS within errors for inland urban sites. The ratio of MODIS to observation over agricultural areas ranged from 61% to 89%; 59%\xe2\x80\x9388% of MODIS fell within the retrieval errors. At homogeneous and well vegetated areas, the comprehensive utilization ratio of MODIS products was over 80% and above 70% of MODIS products fell within the retrieval errors in growing season.'

Abstract: ' The supply of recruits plays an important role in plant and animal population dynamics, and may be governed by environmental and behavioral constraints on animals. Mated females of the mayfly genus Baetis alight on rocks protruding from streams, crawl under water and deposit a single egg mass under a rock. We surveyed oviposition and emergence of a bivoltine population of B. bicaudatus in multiple stream reaches in one high-altitude watershed in western Colorado over 3\xc2\xa0years to establish qualitative patterns at a regional scale (entire watershed), and quantitative patterns over six generations at a local scale (one stream reach). We also measured characteristics of preferred oviposition substrates, performed experiments to test hypotheses about cues used by females to select oviposition sites, and measured mortality of egg masses in the field. Our goals were to determine whether: (1) hydrologic variation necessitated dispersal of females to find suitable oviposition sites; (2) the local supply of females could provide the supply of local recruits; and (3) local recruitment determined the local production of adults. The onset of oviposition corresponded with the decline of spring run-off, which differed dramatically among years and among sites within years. However, eggs appeared before any adults had emerged in 8 of 22 site-years, and adults emerged 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0weeks before any eggs were oviposited in 3 site-years. Furthermore, the size distribution of egg masses differed from that predicted by the size distribution of females that emerged from seven of nine stream reaches. Protruding rocks and eggs appeared earlier each summer in smaller tributaries than in larger mainstream reaches, suggesting that hydrologic and behavioral constraints on oviposition may force females to disperse away from their natal reach to oviposit, and possibly explain the predominantly upstream flight of Baetis females reported in other studies. Local oviposition rates in one third-order stream-reach increased rapidly as soon as substrates protruded from the water surface, and females preferred large rocks that became available early in the flight season. However, females oviposited on <10% of all available rocks, and <65% of preferred rocks as determined by an empirical model. These data indicated that the timing of appearance of suitable oviposition sites determined the phenology of local recruitment, but that preferred oviposition sites were not saturated. Thus, the magnitude of local recruitment was not limited by the absolute abundance of preferred oviposition sites. Only 22% of egg masses observed in the field suffered mortality during their embryonic development, and per capita Baetis egg mass mortality was significantly lower on rocks with higher densities of egg masses. Thus, we suspect that specialized oviposition behavior may reduce the probability of egg mortality, potentially compensating for the costs of dispersal necessary to locate suitable oviposition sites. Finally, the number of adults that emerged at one stream reach was independent of the number of egg masses oviposited over six generations of Baetis; and local recruitment was not a function of the number of adults of the previous generation that emerged locally. The patterns of oviposition and emergence of Baetis found in this study are consistent with the following hypotheses. Recruitment of eggs in a stream reach is not limited by the local supply of adults, but is a function of the regional supply of dispersing adults, which are constrained by the spatial and temporal distribution of preferred oviposition habitat. Furthermore, subsequent local production of adults is not a function of the supply of recruits, arguing for post-recruitment control of local populations by processes operating in the larval stage (e.g., predation, competition, dispersal, disturbance). Processes affecting larval and adult stages of Baetis act independently and at different scales, thereby decoupling local population dynamics of successive generations.'

Abstract: 'Most stingless bee species build their nests inside tree hollows. In this paper, we present trap-nest containers which simulate nesting cavities so as to attract swarms of stingless bees. Although regularly used by stingless bee beekeepers in Brazil, this technique to obtain new colonies has not yet been systematically studied. We used two different types of trap-nests (plastic and cardboard) of four different sizes (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\xc2\xa0L) containing propolis extract and wax. Over a period of 2\xc2\xa0years, 61 swarms of nine different stingless bee species were attracted to the trap-nests. Most swarms chose the largest container (3\xc2\xa0L); swarms were collected mostly in springtime (October\xe2\x80\x93December). The plastic containers were more successfully occupied than others by stingless bee swarms. Trap-nests are a viable tool for stingless beekeepers, researchers and conservation biologists to obtain and study stingless bee colonies.'

Abstract: ' With rare exceptions, anuran larvae have traditionally been considered to occupy lower trophic levels in aquatic communities where they function as microphagous suspension feeders. This view is being challenged by studies showing that tadpoles with generalized morphology often function as macrophagous predators. Here, we review the literature concerning macrophagy by tadpoles and provide two additional examples involving generalized tadpoles. In the first, we demonstrate with laboratory and field experiments that wood frog (Rana sylvatica) tadpoles are major predators of macroinvertebrates in ponds. In the second, we show that green frog (R. clamitans) tadpoles can cause catastrophic reproductive failure of the wood frog via egg predation. These results and data from other studies challenge the assumption that generalized tadpoles function as filter-feeding omnivores, and question the general applicability of community organization models which assume that predation risk increases with pond permanence. We suggest that predation risk is greater in temporary ponds than in more permanent ponds for many organisms that are vulnerable to predation by tadpoles. This being so, a conditional model based upon interactions that are species-specific, life-stage-specific, and context-dependent may better explain community organization along hydrological gradients than models which assume that temporary ponds have few or no predators.'

Abstract: 'Compound farms are a homegarden-type of agroforestry system involving the deliberate management of multipurpose trees and shrubs in a multistoried association with agricultural crops and small livestock within the compounds of individual houses. In addition to the advantages of diversified production, risk minimization, improved labour and nutrient use efficiences and soil conservation, compound farms represent germplasm banks containing many of the useful tree/ shrub species currently disappearing due to indiscriminate clearing of fore and woodlands.'

Abstract: 'Using faunal analysis, this article outlines a coastal mammalian harvesting pattern involving a few terrestrial mammals whose biomass appears to have been greater when associated with man than under \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d conditions. Archeological evidence suggests that these animals fed regularly on cultivated crops and were hunted in house gardens and cultivated fields. By concentrating the supply of both carbohydrates and animal protein, \xe2\x80\x9cgarden hunting\xe2\x80\x9d may have eliminated seasonality and scheduling problems. And because it artificially increased the biomass of selected animals, it may have functioned as a substitute for animal domestication.'

Abstract: 'Studies about processes determining biodiversity in Pantanal are urgently needed and the use of invertebrates for this purpose may be an efficient tool. The purpose of this paper is to verify whether ants could be used to predict human impacts on Pantanal, assessing how environmental characteristics of gallery forest influence arboreal ant species richness. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that: (i) resource availability (estimated by tree density) and (ii) diversity of environmental conditions (estimated by structural heterogeneity) positively influence arboreal ant species richness and composition. Ants were sampled in a gallery forest in the Miranda River. Ant species richness did not respond to tree density, but increased with structural heterogeneity. Species composition was affected both by tree density and structural heterogeneity. The species list produced in the present study showed a high similarity between arboreal ant faunas of Cerrado and Pantanal, which are contiguous biomes. The relationship of ant species richness with heterogeneity, as well as the observed changes of species composition with tree density and heterogeneity may be explained by the presence of a variation of environmental conditions, which create several micro-habitats in the forest. The response of the ant community can reflect human impacts on the forests of the studied region, which are usually modified to create patches for sport fishing and by pathways used in ecotourism.'

Abstract: 'Although lichens develop their highest biomass in cool-temperate climates, lichen fungi may form highly diverse assemblages in tropical lowland rain forests. The reasons for such high species richness are not well known. The present study tested the hypothesis that lichen diversity in the northern Atlantic rain forest mainly depends on habitat diversity and conservation status of forest fragments. To this end, the known lichen biota of 23 forest remnants in the region was analyzed. We identified 784 species, with 11 taxa newly reported from Brazil and 44 from Bahia. The vast majority (711) are principally corticolous, while 53 are saxicolous and 20 terricolous. The most frequent species in terms of site occurrence were found at 13 sites, whereas over half of the taxa (462) were only found at a single site. This coincides with an overall low average sampling score, with only six sites being moderately well to well sampled. The number of species per site varied between 5 and 371. Multiple linear regression of species richness with the parameters, site extension, habitat diversity, sampling effort, conservation status, and elevation, was strong and highly significant, with site extension, habitat diversity, and sampling effort being the best predictors for species richness. Site ordination based on species composition suggested a correlation with conservation status and species richness, as well as site extension and habitat diversity. There was no overall correlation between species composition and geographical location of sites along a north\xe2\x80\x93south gradient, but an underlying pattern was detected, suggesting some species turnover along a macroecological gradient. A predictive model using a combined score from the five parameters resulted in a strong and highly significant linear correlation with observed species richness. Using a quantitative, site-based method, we predicted a minimum of 44 and a maximum of 583 species per studied site and we estimated the overall richness for the northern Atlantic rain forest to be 1017 species. Traditional estimators (Chao 1, Chao 2, Jackknife 1, Jackknife 2, Bootstrap) resulted in predicted values ranging between 971 and 1527 species overall. The results of the study are relevant for conservation priorities, as they show that well-conserved areas with a higher habitat diversity (e.g., including transitional forest types and open areas) are an important component preserving the original diversity of the Atlantic Rain Forest, accounting for a large part of the extant biodiversity of this biome.'

Abstract: 'Integrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in business is one of the great challenges facing firms today. Societal stakeholders require much more from the firm than pursuing profitability and growth. But these societal stakeholders often simply assume that increased societal expectations can easily be accommodated within efficiently run business operations, without much attention devoted to process issues. We build upon the core\xe2\x80\x93periphery thesis to explore potential avenues for firms to add recurring CSR initiatives to their existing business practices. Based on Siggelkow\xe2\x80\x99s (Admin Sci Quart 47:125\xe2\x80\x93159, 2002) analysis of organizational change, we conceptualize seven major patterns of CSR initiative adoption. We develop a new organizing framework showing how a firm can integrate CSR initiatives in business. Within the new framework, each of the seven patterns represents an idiosyncratic path through which recurring CSR initiatives can be included as practices into conventional operations. We also explore the nature of the resulting internal fit between recurring CSR initiatives and business practices.'

Abstract: 'Cyprinids were sampled, by electrofishing, from 159 sites on small rivers in four major watersheds across central Thailand. Total abundance, estimated by the depletion method, varied directly with water velocity and, inversely with discharge while species richness varied inversely with habitat width and, directly with ambient oxygen and alkalinity. Numerical abundance of cyprinids was well above that for any of the other 27 families of fishes represented in the catches. Incidence of occurrence was high only for a few cyprinid species in each watershed with most species present in \xe2\x89\xa410% of the sites. Across all sites, cyprinids represented approximately 35% of all species captured and were absent from only two sites. Species richness was highest in the Maeklong watershed. Canonical correspondence analysis identified five significant habitat variables, temperature, habitat width, discharge, ambient oxygen and alkalinity, and the extent to which each influenced the distribution of the 41 cyprinid species. The results are discussed in relation to environmental factors and ecological adaptations.'

Abstract: 'Fossil wood is both abundant and ubiquitous through geological time and space. During growth the parent plant was directly influenced by the biotic and abiotic (including climatic-) factors in the surrounding environment. The climate affects wood production in a number of ways and it is the resulting physiognomic and chemical characters that can help retrodict palaeoclimate. Physiognomic characters include those morphological and anatomical characters that in turn have enabled the use of wood characters, tree ring characters and statistical parameters (Mean Sensitivity) to determine seasonality, length and favourability of growing season, growth rates and forest productivity. Potential chemical characters discussed include (i)\xe2\x90\xa3the preservation of wood-derived compounds (e.g. guaiacyl, syringyl p-hydroxyphenyl and resins); (ii)\xe2\x90\xa3degree of lignin degradation to determine climate induced environmental changes; and (iii) stable isotopes (\xce\xb4D, \xce\xb413C and \xce\xb418O) to help determine aspects of past climates as derived from environmental changes. The feasibility and methodology of these characters, in both angiosperm and conifer wood, are reviewed in order to establish certain safe guards, or prerequisites, such that interpretations of palaeoclimate can be as unbiased, and thus as reliable, as possible.'

Abstract: 'Pollen monitoring has become a standard investigation method for researchers in several disciplines; among them are Quaternary palynologists, who conduct experiments in order to gain insights that will help to interpret the content of pollen in sediments. A review of the literature shows how these experiments diversified during the 1920s and 1930s with an array of different research questions, ranging from pollination biology to hay fever studies. Quaternary palynologists gained renewed interest with the possibility of radiocarbon dating late Quaternary sediments and obtaining accumulation rates. Also, the comprehensive model of pollen deposition and the pollen budget studies by H. Tauber encouraged researchers to conduct similar experiments using the same type of pollen trap, which became the main trapping device for Quaternary palynologists. The high precipitation in the tropics inspired the development of alternative designs. The equipment used to assess the pollen content in the air has evolved from simple gravity devices to different types of apparatus using a vacuum pump or revolving rods that collect the pollen on impact. Silicone impregnated filters exposed perpendicularly to the wind can also yield a volumetric assessment and have proven useful in areas with a low content of pollen in the air. The literature review is followed by a brief account of the developments which established the basis for the formation of a group of scientists monitoring the pollen deposition at a network of sites using standard pollen traps, the Pollen Monitoring Programme (PMP). Over the last 15\xc2\xa0years the network has collected a large dataset, which is now available to answer a number of research questions. A summary of selected regions and environments, for which pollen monitoring results are available, is provided to serve as a complement to the investigations mentioned above and to provide an overview that may stimulate new research.'

Abstract: 'Chemical signals emitted by the plant frequently mediate host-plant localization in specialized animal \xe2\x80\x93 plant associations. Studying the interdependent highly specialized association of the narrowly oligolectic bee pollinator Protodiscelis palpalis (Colletidae, Neopasiphaeinae) with Hydrocleys martii (Alismataceae) in ephemeral aquatic water bodies in semi-arid Caatinga of Brazil, we asked if specific volatile compounds produced by the flowers mediate pollinator attraction. The yellow Hydrocleys flowers are the sole pollen and nectar resources, and mating sites for the bees. We analyzed the floral scents of this species and of the closely related H. nymphoides, which is not visited by P. palpalis, and tested the main volatile compounds of both species under field conditions to evaluate their attractiveness to bees of P. palpalis. Methoxylated aromatics were the dominant floral scent components in both species, but each species exhibited a characteristic scent profile. Dual choice bioassays using artificial flowers made of yellow and blue adhesive paper clearly revealed that \xcf\x81-methylanisole alone, the dominant volatile of H. martii, attracted significantly more bees than unbaited flowers. This compound represents an olfactory communication channel used by the plant that lures its effective oligolectic pollinators to its flowers. Yellow artificial flowers baited significantly more bees than blue ones. Our study reinforces the recent findings that specific compounds in complex floral scent bouquets are crucial for host-plant location in oligolectic bees.'

Abstract: 'Terrestrial cyanobacteria dwelling on rocks and stone walls represent an important but still understudied part of global biodiversity, despite their substantial importance to the environment. Microbial biofilms, including those formed by cyanobacteria, play an essential role in the succession on rock habitats as they possess a unique ability to gradually change the biotope. In this review, we have gathered 180 research publications reporting on occurrence of 762 species of terrestrial cyanobacteria on rock surfaces worldwide. Despite the long history of phycological research in general, Europe remains the most thoroughly explored region in the field of terrestrial phycology. A total of 401 taxa records from aerial epilithic habitats have been reported from this subcontinent. With regard to the lack of comparably comprehensive studies from different areas of the world, reliable comparisons of species richness among different geographical regions and climatic zones are not available at the moment. Heterocytous and coccoid cyanobacteria prevailed on the rocks and stones in terms of biomass, however, the species richness seemed to be distributed equally among coccoid (269 taxa), simple filamentous (275 taxa), and heterocytous (218 taxa) forms. As the heterogeneity of the available data shows, further thorough research on this often neglected group of organisms is desirable. To set a starting point for such an effort, this review summarizes the current state of knowledge on aerial epilithic cyanobacterial communities on both natural and anthropogenic stone surfaces around the world.'

Abstract: 'New conceptual models that highlight the importance of environmental, rather than molecular, controls on soil organic matter affect interpretations of organic matter (OM) persistence across terrestrial and aquatic boundaries. We propose that changing paradigms in our thinking about OM decomposition explain some of the uncertainties surrounding the fate of land-derived carbon (C) in marine environments. Terrestrial OM, which historically has been thought to be chemically recalcitrant to decay in soil and aquatic environments, dominates inputs to rivers yet is found in trace amounts in the ocean. We discuss three major transformations in our understanding of OM persistence that influence interpretations of the fate of aquatic OM: (1) a shift away from an emphasis on chemical recalcitrance as a primary predictor of turnover; (2) new interpretations of radiocarbon ages, which affect predictions of reactivity; and (3) the recognition that most OM leaving soils in dissolved form has been microbially processed. The first two explain rapid turnover for terrigenous OM in aquatic ecosystems once it leaves the soil matrix. The third suggests that the presence of terrestrial OM in aquatic ecosystems may be underestimated by the use of plant biomarkers. Whether these mechanisms occur in isolation of each other or in combination, they provide insight into the missing terrestrial C signature in the ocean. Spatially and temporally varying transformations of OM along land\xe2\x80\x93water networks require that common terrestrial source indicators be interpreted within specific environmental contexts. We identify areas of research where collaborations between aquatic and terrestrial scientists will enhance quantification of C transfer from soils to inland water bodies, the ocean, and the atmosphere. Accurate estimates of OM processing are essential for improving predictions of the response of vulnerable C pools at the interface of soil and water to changes in climate and land use.'

Abstract: 'The composition and structure of bird communities, and the damage to forest structure were surveyed in northern French Guiana (northeastern Amazonia) one year and ten years after selective logging and compared with the situation in a similar undisturbed primary forest. A point-count method was used in which 937 0.25ha sample plots were censused for 20 minutes each, and their vegetation structure was measured. On average, 38% of the forest undergrowth was destroyed, then invaded by dense regrowth, and up to 63% of the canopy was substantially opened as a result of selective logging. Hunting pressure also increased due to access roads opened for logging. Among the 256 species recorded, overall bird species richness and abundance were depressed by 27\xe2\x80\x9334% in the logged areas compared to primary forest. The most vulnerable guilds, which decreased by 37\xe2\x80\x9398% in abundance, were mature forest understorey species, especially terrestrial ones and mixed flocks of insectivores. Hummingbirds, small gaps, vine tangles and canopy species did not decrease, nor increase significantly after logging. Only species naturally associated with dense second growth, forest edges and large gaps actually increased. Habitat specialization was the major determinant of vulnerability to logging, and, to a lesser degree, size (large) and diet (insectivorous), but foraging behaviour and rarity had little effect. Bird sensitivity to changes in logged forest structure may involve physiological intolerance, reduced food categories, increased exposure to predators, too dense understorey for their specific foraging behaviour and/or avoidance of gaps. Suggested improvements of current forest management and logging techniques for the maintenance of a higher proportion of the original biodiversity include minimizing logging damages, long rotations (>50 years) between cuts, and keeping unlogged forest patches within logging concessions.'

Abstract: 'Shifting cultivation (jhooming) has been identified as one of the main human impacts influencing biodiversity in Tripura, Northeast India. Over the last few years a new class of shifting cultivators has emerged that has adopted non-traditional forms of jhooming, which have been responsible for the loss of biological diversity in the state. This paper describes the successes achieved by the state government in providing the jhumias (tribes practicing jhooming) with various non-jhooming options. Recommendations include the need for short and long term control measures, improvement of existing jhooming methods, and integration of traditional knowledge with new practices.'

Abstract: 'The question of whether or not biofuels help mitigate climate change has attracted much debate in the literature. Using a global computable general equilibrium model that explicitly represents land-use change impacts due to the expansion of biofuels, our study attempts to shed some light on this question. Our study shows that if biofuel mandates and targets currently announced by more than 40 countries around the world are implemented by 2020 using crop feedstocks and if both forests and pasture lands are used to meet the new land demands for biofuel expansion, this would cause net release of GHG emissions to the atmosphere until 2043 as the GHG emissions released through land-use change exceeds the reduction of emissions due to replacement of gasoline and diesel. On the other hand, if the use of forest lands is avoided by channeling only pasture lands to meet the demand for new lands, the net release of GHG emissions would cease by 2021, a year after the full implementation of the mandates and targets.'

Abstract: 'Effects of vegetation and nutrient availability on potentail denitrification rates were studied in two volcanic, alluvial-terrace soils in lowland Costa Rica that differ greatly in weathering stage and thus in availability of P and base cations. Potential denitrification rates were significantly higher in plots where vegetation had been left undisturbed than in plots where all vegetation had been removed continuously, and were higher on the less fertile of the two soils. The potential denitrification rates were correlated strongly with respiration rates, levels of mineralizable N, microbial biomass, and moisture content, and moderately well with concentrations of extractable NH inf4 sup+ , Kjeldahl N, and total C. In all plots, denitrification rates were stimulated by the removal of O2 and by the addition of glucose but not by the addition of water or NO inf3 sup- .'

Abstract: 'Shaded cacao (Theobroma cacao) cultivation is a tropical land-use that has potential to reduce pressure on the forest and provide additional income to smallholder growers. A land-use system (LUS) model was formulated to represent the economic returns derived from shaded cacao production practiced by smallholders in the Toledo district of Belize. Sixty scenarios were tested to elicit response of net-present-value (NPV), returns to labor, and annual returns to land (ARTL) to individual changes in 10 system parameters. Further scenarios tested the combined interactions between hardwood shade tree type, planting density, time to harvest hardwoods, cacao cultivation practice, and expected output. As a modeling exercise, LUS analysis highlights system components that government agencies, donors, NGOs, extension agents, and smallholders should target with policies, agri-silvi- culture projects, and further research. Results identify more favorable credit, labor-saving technology, better shade-management practices, grafting, and incorporating non-hardwood shade trees and laurel (Cordia alliadora) as interventions that could improve cacao financial performance and encourage adoption. At present, the model cannot predict whether smallholders would respond to recommendations and invest in shaded cacao cultivation in lieu of alternative agricultural land-uses or off-farm employment.'

Abstract: 'Two species characterized by locellate anthers are treated, belonging to different sections of Clusia. One of these species, Clusia favus, is described as new. A new name for a species with an unusual volcano-shaped male androecium, belonging to Clusia section Phloianthera, but originally described within the genus Arrudea, is also proposed. A very similar volcano-shaped androecium occurs also in some species of Clusia sect. Cordylandra.'

Abstract: "This paper uses a political ecology approach to examine whether ecotourism along the Pacific Coast of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico promotes stewardship of marine resources, which have been devastated in recent years by uncontrolled commercial harvesting. This case illustrates how conflicts over access to common-pool resources that fueled the demise of area fisheries are now emerging in the rapidly growing industry of recreational whale watching. Even if ecotourism provides a significant new source of income through environmentally friendly, nonconsumptive resource use, it may not be sufficient to discouragelocal people from engaging in other, more destructive forms of consumptive resource use. But resource conflicts may not preclude efforts to promote conservation through ecotourism. Along the shores of Baja's gray whale calving lagoons there are nascent, community-based organizations that could serve as vehicles for mobilizing local people into conservation efforts, if local access rights to marine resources were both secure and accorded preference over outside claims to the same."

Abstract: 'Species utilizing distinct resources for offspring production often show plasticity in reproductive strategies as a function of resource quality. For species using ephemeral pools, strategies are mainly shaped by a time constraint related to pool stability, resource availability and the colonizing community. We studied reproductive strategies in Amazonian poison frogs (Dendrobates ventrimaculatus) that are characterized by oviposition in distinct, small and resource-limited water bodies in leaf axils of plants and the transport of newly hatched tadpoles on the back of males to similar water bodies. Cannibalism of eggs by tadpoles was found to be the main cause of egg mortality. Typically, at the end of the rainy season new clutches of eggs were deposited in water bodies already containing a tadpole. Manipulation of the available number of water bodies showed that this observation did not result from resource limitation. We conclude that D. ventrimaculatus has a plastic reproductive strategy that includes provisioning its tadpoles with fertilized eggs as a function of desiccation risk of water bodies housing its offspring. Provisioning behavior is expected to increase developmental rate and, therefore, chances of metamorphosis for tadpoles that hatched towards the end of the rainy season. The plastic food provisioning strategy may be an important evolutionary link to bi-parental and female care with development of obligate unfertilized egg provisioning in the genus Dendrobates.'

Abstract: 'The Wopkaimin are a population of hunter-horticulturalists who live near the Upper Fly River in Papua New Guinea. In this paper, ecosystem heterogeneity is related to diversity of strategies in the Wopkaimin subsistence system. Subsistence subsystems of shifting cultivation, silviculture, gathering, pig raising, hunting, fishing, and collecting are associated with 11 biotopes. Biotopes are useful descriptive categories for subsistence ecological research and they are recognized Wopkaimin emic categories, having cognitive and behavioral consequences. The relationship of the Wopkaimin population to other biota in the ecosystem is shown to be related to a very steep biotope gradient.'

Abstract: 'Subsistence hunting is a traditional practice providing food and many other goods for households in the Yucatan Peninsula, southeast Mexico. Economic, demographic, and cultural change in this region drive wildlife habitat loss and local extinctions. Improving our understanding about current practices of wildlife use may support better management strategies for conserving game species and their habitat. We aimed to evaluate if wildlife use remained relevant for the subsistence of rural residents of the Yucatan Peninsula, as well as if local hunting practices were related to environmental, geographical, and cultural factors.'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to analyze the utilization of tree species within and around the borders of the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala and to compare two sampling methodologies for the acquisition of such data. Residents in the communities of Caoba (border of reserve) and Uaxact\xc3\xban (within reserve) demonstrated significantly different utilization of tree species. Differences were due to the unique ecological and socio-economic conditions in each of the towns. Residents of both communities relied most heavily onSwietenia macrophylla, Manilkara achras. Cedrela odorata, Pouteria mammosa and Caesalpinia spp. Residents of Caoba considered 39% of all useful tree species to be marketable compared with only 18% in Uaxact\xc3\xban. Overall, more than 80 tree species were identified as useful in each of the communities. Changes in forest composition along with dynamic economic conditions were found to be altering the commercial utilization of tree species throughout the region. Some suggestions are offered for community development projects.'

Abstract: 'The description and understanding of plant communities is fundamental for the implementation of conservation or restoration programs, especially when these communities are highly threatened and need to be restored. Campos rupestres, some Neotropical mountain grasslands located in central Brazil and part of the Cerrado biome (covering 2 million km2) host unique plant communities, currently threatened by quarrying and mining. The grassy matrix of campos rupestres, has long been considered a rich mosaic under the control of local topography and the nature of substrate, but this affirmation has not been well studied. We analyzed whether plant communities varied in relation to edaphic factors within the stony substrate and the sandy substrate of this grassy matrix. We selected 5 sites where occur both grasslands on stony substrate and on sandy substrate, and we carried out vegetation surveys and soil analyses. We counted 222 plant species within our communities, among which 38.6% are exclusively found on campos rupestres. Our results show that both soil-types are strongly acidic, nutrient poor and exhibit a seasonal variation. Phosphorus increases and pH and organic carbon decrease during the dry season. Stony soils are slightly richer in nutrients than sandy soils and differences in soil granulometry and composition have led to the formation of distinct plant communities. Some species are confined to either one or the other grassland-type, which makes the plant composition of each community unique. Variations in edaphic factors generate heterogeneous grasslands favorable to a high plant diversity. Conservation programs and restoration actions have to maintain or recreate this heterogeneity. The presence of distinct plant communities implies that different strategies might be adopted to improve the restoration of these ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'In southern Bahia, Brazil, cabrucas are the traditional agroforests in which cacao trees are planted under thinned-out native forests. To analyze the role of cabrucas in tree species conservation, we inventoried the non-cocoa trees in 1.0\xc2\xa0ha plots of cabruca in 16 cocoa farms and compared our results with a similar survey undertaken in the early 1960s in the same region to analyze the long term changes. We also interviewed 160 cocoa farmers to investigate their preferences for species and the main practices used in managing shade trees. The cabrucas showed high levels of tree diversity for an agroforestry system (Shannon index ranging from 2.21 to 3.52) and also high variation in structure and composition among the different farms. Forest specialist trees accounted for most species (63.9%) in the survey and were among the species most preferred by the farmers, although we found evidence that some of these trees are gradually being replaced by other species. Our results indicate that cabrucas are poor substitutes for undisturbed forests in terms of tree species richness, but their presence in human-altered landscapes is of utmost importance to the conservation of forest tree species as they increase overall heterogeneity and may serve as ecological corridors, additional habitats, and buffer zones.'

Abstract: 'We present a detailed analysis of mechanisms underlying the evapotranspiration response to increased \\(\\hbox {CO}_2\\) in HadGEM2-ES, focussed on western Amazonia. We use three simulations from CMIP5 in which atmospheric \\(\\hbox {CO}_2\\) increases at 1% per year reaching approximately four times pre-industrial levels after 140\xc2\xa0years. Using 3-hourly data, we found that evapotranspiration (ET) change was dominated by decreased stomatal conductance (\\(g_s\\)), and to a lesser extent by decreased canopy water and increased moisture gradient (specific humidity difference between surface and near-surface). There were large, non-linear decreases in ET in the simulation in which radiative and physiological forcings could interact. This non-linearity arises from non-linearity in the conductance term (includes aerodynamic and stomatal resistance and partitioning between the two, which is determined by canopy water availability), the moisture gradient, and negative correlation between these two terms. The conductance term is non-linear because GPP responds non-linearly to temperature and GPP is the dominant control on \\(g_s\\) in HadGEM2-ES. In addition, canopy water declines, mainly due to increases in potential evaporation, which further decrease the conductance term. The moisture gradient responds non-linearly owing to the non-linear response of temperature to \\(\\hbox {CO}_2\\) increases, which increases the Bowen ratio. Moisture gradient increases resulting from ET decline increase ET and thus constitute a negative feedback. This analysis highlights the importance of the \\(g_s\\) parametrisation in determining the ET response and the potential differences between offline and online simulations owing to feedbacks on ET via the atmosphere, some of which would not occur in an offline simulation.'

Abstract: 'Mora excelsa and M. gonggrijpii are well segregated along a soil hydrological gradient. M. excelsa is positively associated with soil hydromorphic characteristics such as gley, mottling and groundwater within 1.20 m, whereas M. gonggrijpii is negatively associated with these characteristics. Growth and mortality of artificially installed seedlings were studied in both species in occasionally flooded forest and dryer uphill forest. In a moderate year (1992, no pronounced flooding, no drought), there was no difference between the two species in growth or mortality in the two forest types. M. gonggrijpii was larger in both forest types. Flooding tolerance of seeds and seedlings were studied under controlled water regimes. Seeds of M. gonggrijpii appeared to be very intolerant to flooding, since germination in this species dropped to 50% after only 11 days of flooding. Seeds of M. excelsa floated and 80% of the seeds were viable after as much as 50 days of flooding. Artificially submerged seeds of the latter species had an intermediate survival response. Flooding in seedlings resulted in cessation of growth in both species. Mortality was nil in most treatments, but all M. gonggrijpii individuals died after a treatment of 8 weeks of continuous flooding. Drought tolerance of seedlings of M. excelsa and M. gonggrijpii was studied in a drying-out experiment. Seedlings of both species of approximately equal size differed widely in a number of characteristics: total leaf area, leaf dry weight, leaf thickness, leaf size and leaf area ratio (LAR) were all larger in M. gonggrijpii, while stomatal density and specific leaf area (SLA) were smaller in this species. Seedlings did not differ in stem hydraulic conductivity. M. excelsa showed lower osmotic potential at full hydration. Turgor potential loss points were not nearly approached in the forest during the middle of the dry season in either species. M. gonggrijpii had much lower stomatal conductance than M. excelsa, due to lower stomatal density. Boundary layer conductance was of the same magnitude as stomatal conductance, especially in the morning. In a drying-out experiment, total plant transpiration was higher in M. gonggrijpii, as the lower conductance observed in this species was compensated for by its larger leaf area. M. gonggrijpii was able to extract water from dryer soils than M. excelsa and may be able to utilize its higher leaf water content under moderate drought in the forest understorey.'

Abstract: 'Non-timber forest products (NTFP) represent culturally and economically important resources for millions of people worldwide. Although many NTFP are harvested from disturbed habitats and therefore subject to multiple pressures, few quantitative studies have addressed this issue. Similarly few NTFP studies have assessed seasonal variation in demographic rates even though this can confound harvest effects. In Hawai\xc8\x818i, the wild-gathered ferns, Microlepia strigosa and Sphenomeris chinensis, represent highly important cultural resources but declining populations have led to conservation concerns. Both ferns are harvested from disturbed, alien-dominated forests and contemporary Hawaiian gathering practices often consist of harvest and concurrent weeding of alien invasive species. We assessed the effects of concurrent frond-harvest and alien species weeding on frond structure, density, and rates of production by comparing experimentally harvested vs. control plots, and documented relationships between frond demographic patterns and precipitation. Gathering practices had no impact on frond density of either species or on most other demographic parameters over the short term. Exceptions included a significant decrease in the density of the longest S. chinensis fronds and a significant decrease in M. strigosa frond production when fronds were gathered without alien weeding. However, seasonal and annual changes in frond density and production occurred across all plots of both species and were significantly correlated with precipitation. The relatively low harvest effects for both species are likely due to several factors including short frond longevity and the strict criteria used by gatherers to select harvestable fronds. The potential for sustainable harvest in the context of alien-dominated forests is discussed.'

Abstract: 'The future of biodiversity depends to a great extent on the conservation value of human-dominated and semi-natural habitats. In a mixed agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica, we compared the richness and composition of terrestrial arthropod communities occurring in three habitat types along a gradient of increasing disturbance: in a large (227\xe2\x80\x89ha) forest fragment, small (3.8\xe2\x80\x935.3\xe2\x80\x89ha) forest fragments, and sun coffee (1\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x89ha) plantations. Pitfall trap sampling revealed decreasing morphospecies richness with increasing disturbance. Moreover, the number of species unique to a habitat type was lower in the smaller forest fragments and the coffee sites. We found significant changes in community composition associated with habitat at the levels of order (all arthropods), family (beetles), and morphospecies (carabids, scarabs, and ants). We identified no significant correlation of richness among the taxonomic orders, meaning these taxa are unable to serve as biodiversity indicators (for each other or for all arthropods) in the study region. Arthropod diversity presently found in countryside habitats is certainly lower, and perhaps less sustainable, than that of the extensive forested habitats fragmented < 40 years ago. It nonetheless remains substantial, suggesting a conservation opportunity in human-dominated landscapes of the tropics.'

Abstract: 'Past research has determined the habitat requirements of amphibian species predominantly from presence/absence studies. This study tested the hypothesis that relationships between breeding site habitat components, life history traits and fitness may provide a higher resolution of biological data relating to the habitat requirements of amphibian species. We tested this novel approach by using Litoria ewingii as our model species. We correlated larval and metamorph life history traits with habitat variables at 28 small to medium sized ponds within a commercially logged forest in southern Tasmania, Australia. To avoid larval mortality due to pond desiccation, L. ewingii laid eggs and metamorphosed earlier in smaller ponds. Snout vent length at metamorphosis increased with elevation and metamorphosis was earlier in less shaded ponds. Breeding ponds that maximised the fitness of L. ewingii were higher elevation ponds with reduced shading, steeper bank slopes and reduced pond isolation. The findings of the study equip land managers with a greater ecological understanding of ecosystem function in relation to specific species. The methodological approach has broad application to conservation biology where an awareness of the specific habitat requirements of amphibians is critical to successful ecosystem management.'

Abstract: 'The effects of swidden cultivation on carbon storage and soil quality are outlined and compared to the effects of the intensified production systems that swidden systems of Southeast Asia transform into. Time-averaged aboveground carbon stocks decline by about 90% if the long fallow periods of traditional swidden cultivation are reduced to 4\xc2\xa0years and by about 60% if swidden cultivation is converted to oil palm plantations. Stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in tree plantations are 0\xe2\x80\x9340% lower than stocks in swidden cultivation, with the largest losses found in mechanically established oil palm plantations. Impacts of tree plantations on soil quality are to a large extent determined by management. Conversion of swiddening to continuous annual cropping systems brings about substantial losses of time-averaged aboveground carbon stocks, reductions of SOC stocks and generally leads to declining soil quality. Knowledge of carbon storage in belowground biomass of tree based systems of the tropics is sparse but failure to include this pool in carbon inventories may significantly underestimate the total biomass of the systems. Moreover, studies that consider the ecological reasons behind farmers\xe2\x80\x99 land use decisions as well as spatial variability in biogeophysical and edaphological parameters are needed to evaluate the effects of the ongoing land use transitions in Southeast Asia.'

Abstract: 'Precision agriculture (PA) technologies are being applied to crops in Brazil, which are important to ensure Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s position in agricultural production. However, there are no studies available at present to indicate the extent to which PA technologies are being used in the country. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to investigate how the sugar-ethanol industry in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo state, which produces 60% of the domestic sugarcane, is adopting and using these techniques. For this purpose, primary data were used, which were obtained from a questionnaire sent to all companies operating in the sugar-ethanol industry in the region. The aim was to determine to what extent these companies are adopting and using PA technologies, and also to promote a more in-depth discussion of the topic within the sugar-ethanol industry. Information was obtained on the features of the companies, on sources of information that they use for adopting these technologies, on their impacts on these companies and on obstacles hindering their adoption. The main conclusions of this research suggest that companies that adopt and use PA practices reap benefits, such as managerial improvements, higher yields, lower costs, minimization of environmental impacts and improvements in sugarcane quality.'

Abstract: 'The quality assessment of tropical soils and sediments is still under discussion, with efforts being made on the part of governmental agencies to establish reference values. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) is a potential analytical technique for quantifying diverse chemical elements in geological material without chemical treatment, primarily when it is performed at an appropriate metrological level. In this work, analytical curves were obtained by means of the analysis of geological reference materials (RMs), which allowed for the researchers to draw a comparison among the sources of analytical uncertainty. After having determined the quality assurance of the analytical procedure, the EDXRF method was applied to determine chemical elements in soils from the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The regression coefficients of the analytical curves used to determine Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Si, Sr, Ti, and Zn were higher than 0.99. The quality of the analytical procedure was demonstrated at a 95% confidence level, in which the estimated analytical uncertainties agreed with those from the RM\xe2\x80\x99s certificates of analysis. The analysis of diverse geological samples from Pernambuco indicated higher concentrations of Ni and Zn in sugarcane, with maximum values of 41\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 and 118\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01, respectively, and agricultural areas (41\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 and 127\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01, respectively). The trace element Sr was mainly enriched in urban soils with values of 400\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01. According to the results, the EDXRF method was successfully implemented, providing some chemical tracers for the quality assessment of tropical soils and sediments.'

Abstract: 'Invasive alien weeds pose a serious threat to the biodiversity of natural ecosystems and a significant constraint to agricultural production worldwide. The use of co-evolved natural enemies, a strategy referred to as classical biological control (CBC), has proven to be a potentially efficacious, cost-effective, and safe option for the management of alien weeds. An analysis of CBC of invasive weeds in Latin America is presented, which shows that only 5% of the worldwide releases of agents, overwhelmingly arthropod, have been in this region. Fungal pathogens are increasingly being considered in CBC programmes, and there are now 11 examples of Latin American fungi having been released as biocontrol agents in other regions of the world. In contrast, only three weed pathogens have been deliberately released in the region. Possible reasons for the paucity of CBC programmes in Latin America are presented, despite the presence of a significant number of alien weed species (60 are listed). An analysis of these weeds reveals that many of them could be amenable to control using natural enemies, including nine weed species for which CBC programmes have been successfully implemented elsewhere in the world. In addition, for many of these 60 species, a co-evolved and damaging mycobiota has already been recorded. The prospects for management of invasive alien weeds in Latin America, using co-evolved fungal pathogens, are assessed with particular reference to selected species from the genera Ambrosia, Broussonetia, Calotropis, Commelina, Cyperus, Dichrostachys, Echinochloa, Pittosporum, Rottboellia, Rubus, Sonchus and Ulex.'

Abstract: 'The creation of National Parks challenges institutions, technicians and actors involved in the processes of management and protection of natural resources, due to numerous conflicts experienced by local population. The extensiveness of nine municipalities in the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park (PEST\xe2\x80\x94acronym in portuguese) within the limits of the Park, along with the development of cities, displays many interests and land conflicts in the Park. This situation forced, in 2009, governmental parties to establish a new demarcation process, aiming the removal of conflict areas and creation of new categories of protected areas. In this context, this paper aims to report the PEST history, collecting environmental characteristics and land use owned by the environmental protection area of surrounding coastal of the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park, in the northeastern portion of the Baixada Massiambu, the locations of the Pinheira and Guarda do Emba\xc3\xba beaches, in city of Palho\xc3\xa7a/SC, Brazil. On this regard, a literature research was performed, referring to the uses of the area under study, as well as the legal and territory definitions; then, field visits were performed from March 2012 to March 2014, and finally, data collected were aggregated using geographic information systems, along with data regarding the ecological and legal characteristics of the area. Results displayed 6501 plots of land on the Pinheira and Guarda do Emba\xc3\xba beaches, and of these, 77% had no environmental restrictions, 13% had partial restrictions, and 10% presented total restrictions. Thus, the PEST delimitation demonstrated great ecological significance for human settlement, especially in some detached areas, which should be kept and preserved. This work makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of the Baixada Massiambu problem, mainly related to land use; protective measures and environmental recovery can be formulated in this region, taking into consideration aspects such as environmental planning and mechanisms of reorganization discussion for this territory.'

Abstract: 'The solutions for processing sentiment analysis are very important and very helpful for many researchers, many applications, etc. This new model has been proposed in this paper, used in the English document-level sentiment classification. In this research, we propose a new model using C4.5 Algorithm of a decision tree to classify semantics (positive, negative, neutral) for the English documents. Our English training data set has 140,000 English sentences, including 70,000 English positive sentences and 70,000 English negative sentences. We use the C4.5 algorithm on the 70,000 English positive sentences to generate a decision tree and many association rules of the positive polarity are created by the decision tree. We also use the C4.5 algorithm on the 70,000 English negative sentences to generate a decision tree and many association rules of the negative polarity are created by the decision tree. Classifying sentiments of one English document is identified based on the association rules of the positive polarity and the negative polarity. Our English testing data set has 25,000 English documents, including 12,500 English positive reviews and 12,500 English negative reviews. We have tested our new model on our testing data set and we have achieved 60.3% accuracy of sentiment classification on this English testing data set.'

Abstract: "The basidiomycete fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa is the causal agent of Witches' Broom Disease (WBD) in cacao (Theobroma cacao). It is a hemibiotrophic pathogen that colonizes the apoplast of cacao's meristematic tissues as a biotrophic pathogen, switching to a saprotrophic lifestyle during later stages of infection. M. perniciosa, together with the related species M. roreri, are pathogens of aerial parts of the plant, an uncommon characteristic in the order Agaricales. A genome survey (1.9\xc3\x97 coverage) of M. perniciosa was analyzed to evaluate the overall gene content of this phytopathogen."

Abstract: 'In the Indian subcontinent there is hardly any study that compares the bird community structure of urban/suburban areas with those of forest habitat. The present survey identified diverse assemblages of birds in the Pauri district at different elevations. A total of 125 bird species belonging to 40 families including two least count species (Lophura leucomelanos and Pucrasia marcolopha) were recorded during this survey in the forest and urbanized habitats of Pauri District (Garhwal Hiamalaya) of Uttarakhand state, India. The high elevation (Pauri 1600\xe2\x80\x932100 m a.s.l.), mid elevation (Srikot-Khanda 900\xe2\x80\x931300 m a.s.l.) and low elevation (Srinagar 500\xe2\x80\x93900 m a.s.l.) contributed 88.8%, 63.2% and 58.4% of the total species respectively. Rarefaction analysis and Shannon diversity index showed that the high elevation forest habitat had highest bird species richness (BSR) and bird species diversity (BSD) followed by the mid and then the low elevation forests. BSR and BSD fluctuated across seasons at all elevations but not across habitat types. Present study provides a base line data about avian community composition in urbanized and natural habitats along altitudinal gradient in the study area. This information may be useful to the conservation biologists for the better management and conservation of the avifauna in the Western Himalaya, a part of one of the hot biodiversity spots of the world.'

Abstract: 'A knowledge of the distribution of the contribution of upwind sources to measurements of vertical scalar flux densities is important for the correct interpretation of eddy covariance data. Several approaches have been developed to estimate this so-called footprint function. Here a new approach based on the ensemble-averaged Navier\xe2\x80\x94Stokes equations is presented. Comparisons of numerical results using this approach with results from other studies under a range of environmental conditions show that the model predictions are robust. Moreover, the approach outlined here has the advantage of a potential wide applicability, due to an ability to take into account the heterogeneous nature of underlying surfaces. For example, the model showed that any variations in surface drag, such as must occur in real life heterogeneous canopies, can exert a marked influence of the shape and extent of flux footprints. Indeed, it seems likely that under such circumstances, estimates of surface fluxes will be weighted towards areas of highest foliage density (and therefore quite likely higher photosynthetic rates) close to the measurement sensor.'

Abstract: 'Our understanding of why tropical forest species differ in their ability to inhabit agroecosystems is limited, despite the link between this ability and the likelihood of population decline for species inhabiting regions undergoing widespread conversion of forest to agriculture. We used logistic regression and data from southern Costa Rica to develop a model based on natural history characteristics to distinguish between forest species that did or did not use agricultural land covers. We sampled birds along 15 3.0-km routes, seven in forest and eight in agriculture, five times over three years. Each species was classified as an F-species, detected only in forest, a G-species, detected in both forest and agriculture, or an A-species, detected only in agriculture. Thirty percent of species were F-species, 42% were G-species, and 28% were A-species. Based on the logistic regression model, the likelihood of being a G-species, as opposed to an F-species, was low for species that were dependent on forest interior, had a stenophagous diet, and a small elevational range. Weight, resident versus migrant status, and whether or not a species was insectivorous, were not significant predictors of being a G-species. For all F\xe2\x80\x93G species pairs, the model correctly predicted the G-species 70% of the time. The model provides a first step in identifying those characteristics that predispose forest species to use agricultural land. In addition, our results indicate that the structurally simple agricultural systems of the study region are of limited value for a large proportion of the regional species pool.'

Abstract: ' Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3,-butadiene), produced by many woody and a few herbaceous plant species, is the dominant volatile organic compound released from vegetation. It represents a non-trivial carbon loss to the plant (typically 0.5\xe2\x80\x932%, but much higher as temperatures exceed 30\xc2\xb0C), and plays a major role in tropospheric chemistry of forested regions, contributing to ozone formation. This review summarizes current knowledge concerning the occurrence of isoprene production within the plant kingdom, and discusses other aspects of isoprene biology which may be of interest to the ecological community. The ability to produce significant amounts of isoprene may or may not be shared by members of the same plant family or genus, but emitting species have been found among bryophytes, ferns, conifers and Ephedra and in approximately one-third of the 122 angiosperm families examined. No phylogenetic pattern is obvious among the angiosperms, with the trait widely scattered and present (and absent) in both primitive and derived taxa, although confined largely to woody species. Isoprene is not stored within the leaf, and plays no known ecological role as, for example, an anti-herbivore or allelopathic agent. The primary short-term controls over isoprene production are light and temperature. Growth in high light stimulates isoprene production, and growth in cool conditions apparently inhibits isoprene, production of which may be induced upon transfer to warmer temperatures. The stimulation of isoprene production by high irradiance and warm temperatures suggests a possible role in ameliorating stresses associated with warm, high-light environments, a role consistent with physiological evidence indicating a role in thermal protection.'

Abstract: '\nLatin American subtropical dry ecosystems have experienced significant human impact for more than a century, mainly in the form of extensive livestock grazing, forest products extraction, and agriculture expansion. We assessed the regional-scale effect of land use and land cover (LULC) on patterns of richness distribution of trees, birds, amphibians, and mammals in the Northern Argentine Dry Chaco (NADC) over c. 19 million hectares. Using species distribution models in a hierarchical framework, we modeled the distributions of 138 species. First, we trained the models for the entire Argentinean Chaco with climatic and topographic variables. Second, we modeled the same species for the NADC including the biophysical variables identified as relevant in the first step plus four LULC-related variables: woody biomass, distance to crops, density of livestock-based rural settlements (puestos), and vegetation cover. Third, we constructed species richness maps by adding the models of individual species and considering two situations, with and without LULC variables. Four, richness maps were used for assessing differences when LULC variables are added and for determining the main drivers of current patterns of species richness. We found a marked decrease in species richness of the four groups as a consequence of inclusion of LULC variables in distribution models. The main factors associated with current richness distribution patterns (both negatively) were woody biomass and density of livestock puestos. Species richness in present-day Semiarid Chaco landscapes is strongly affected by LULC patterns, even in areas not transformed to agriculture. Regional-scale biodiversity planning should consider open habitats such as grasslands and savannas in addition to woodlands.\n'

Abstract: 'As for many other taxa, hummingbird diversity declines away from the equator, but the causes for this decline are still disputed and might involve, among others, climatic factors or the availability of food resources. Because hummingbirds are one of the classical examples for plant\xe2\x80\x93animal coevolution, it has been proposed that the diversity of hummingbird assemblages might depend on the diversity of food plants available. We tested this hypothesis by studying the hummingbird assemblages and their food plants for 1\xc2\xa0year at six sites along a 660-km-long transect in Bolivian lowland forests extending from the southernmost Amazonian rain forests to dry Chaco forests. Hummingbird diversity was higher in the northern three sites as compared to the southern ones, with an abrupt decline in species numbers and a corresponding change in taxonomic composition at the boundary from evergreen to drought deciduous forests. Hummingbird diversity and abundance were only weakly correlated to climatic factors or to the diversity of humming-visited flowers, but strongly to the seasonal abundance of flowers. The overlap in nectar diet between hummingbird species depended on the number of plant species: when numerous species were available, the hummingbirds segregated by feeding preferences, but when few flowers were available, all hummingbirds fed on the same plants. We conclude that the local diversity of hummingbird species is not primarily determined by the diversity of food plants, but rather by the abundance of flowers available at any given point in time.'

Abstract: 'This special issue of Coral Reefs stems from a thematic session held at the European Meeting of the International Society for Reef Studies held in Cambridge in September 2002. A wide range of papers were presented, covering aspects of oceanography, sediment transport and accumulation, sedimentary settings, species assemblages, coral physiology, and geological evolution. These presentations emphasized the diversity and potential significance of the coral communities that occur in a wide range of what might be described as \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal\xe2\x80\x9d settings, and demonstrated the geological and ecological significance of marginal and non-reef-building coral environments. Most papers published in this issue were submitted from researchers who presented work at the Cambridge meeting; however, some additional contributions were also accepted.'

Abstract: 'This essay discusses how a person could change the way in which they understand and interpret ature, and the way in which outdoor experiences influence beliefs and attitudes. Writing from a personal perspective, I consider the metaphorical images of nature which I developed during my life. Images of cliffs as playgrounds or gymnasiums, images of National Parks as museums or cathedrals and images of nature as a friend or relative are discussed. My conclusions are that personal outdoor experiences can enable someone to develop a clearer understanding of their relatedness to nature which can influence their everyday living practices and preferences.'

Abstract: 'This study draws together information on several aspects of species diversity in Scopulini (Lepidoptera: Geometridae, Sterrhinae) on a world-wide scale. Eight variables, describing for example rates of species description, synonymy rates, and geographical distribution of the Scopulini and its constituent genera, were coded for all putatively valid species of Scopulini and were incorporated into a computerized database. The dynamics of species descriptions per decade shows that it peaked around 1900, remained high until the 1940s, and the cumulative curve is yet to reach an asymptote. Both absolute and cumulative curves of species descriptions per decade have taken a variety of forms in the different biogeographical regions. Amongst biogeographical regions the number of synonyms per species is broadly related, that is, the more valid names, the more synonyms. The distributions of the total number of synonyms associated with valid species names and the numbers of authors describing different numbers of species are both right-skewed. Based on the distribution of the type localities of the putatively valid species, the Scopulini are a cosmopolitan group. The biogeographical regions where most species have been described from were found to be the African, especially sub-Saharan areas, and the Orient, whereas the low number of described species of the Neotropics is noticeable. The number of described species in relation to latitude follows roughly the shape of a normal distribution, being highest at low latitudes with a peak in temperate zones in the Northern hemisphere, and decreasing towards higher latitudes. The underlying causes for patterns of species descriptions are discussed, and the results of our analyses are in part used to estimate actual numbers of the Scopulini species occurring in each geographical area.'

Abstract: 'The world has a continuing demand and utility for liquid fuels to power its societies. The utilization of crude oil based fuels is leading to a dramatic increase in the CO2 content of the atmosphere which is being related to a dangerously warming earth. Having liquid fuels that are derived from biological sources is one solution to this growing problem since the carbon being utilized is only from recycled sources. Presently, the microbes, having the greatest impact on the world\xe2\x80\x99s economies, producing liquid fuel are various yeasts producing ethanol. Other microbial sources need to be sought since ethanol is not the most desirable fuel and yeasts require simple sugars to carry out the fermentation processes. Recently, several endophytic fungi have been described that make hydrocarbons with fuel potential (Mycodiesel). Among others the compounds found in the volatile phases of these cultures include alkanes, branched alkanes, cyclohexanes, cyclopentanes, and alkyl alcohols/ketones, benzenes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Most importantly, generally these organisms make hydrocarbons while utilizing complex carbohydrates found in all plant-based agricultural wastes. Also discussed in this review is a rationale for finding hydrocarbon producing endophytes as well as examples of other promising hydrocarbon producers-Nodulisporium spp. which make 1,8-cineole and families of other hydrocarbons. Extremely favorable results of engine and fuel testing experiments recently completed on cineole and other products of Nodulisporium sp. are also presented. Finally, there is a brief discussion on the main limiting steps in the domestication of these fungi'

Abstract: 'Using data from a three-year study of socioeconomic factors influencing hunting in 23 indigenous communities, we assess the influence of indigenous and Christian beliefs and practices on dietary taboos among Makushi and Wapishana peoples in the Guyanese Amazon. We found that members of Evangelical and established (Anglican and Catholic) churches do not differ significantly in terms of their adherence to dietary restrictions and members of Sabbatarian churches show a stronger tendency to adhere to dietary taboos than Evangelicals or members of established churches. Counter to expectations, we found no significant difference in avoidance of meat between households belonging to established and Evangelical churches. Furthermore, members of all church groups deviated in terms of dietary restrictions from indigenous norms as exemplified in dietary advice given by shamans. We conclude that, despite doctrinal opposition to shamanistic practices associated with indigenous taboos, there is continuity in terms of dietary practice among Makushi and Wapishana households that have converted to Evangelical and, to some degree, Sabbatarian forms of Christianity.'

Abstract: 'Rubber tree [Hevea Braziliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell-Arg.], a native species of the Amazon Rainforest in South America, belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family, is world\xe2\x80\x99s major source of natural latex. Brazil, despite being the center of origin and diversity of the species and latex main producer at the end of XIX century, nowadays imports around 70% of the rubber consumed in the country. Although the Amazonian basin provides optimal conditions for rubber plantation, the occurrence of South American leaf blight (SALB) disease, caused by the ascomycete Microcyclus ulei, limits the rubber production in this region. Therefore, rubber plantation has been extended to suboptimal areas that are prominently located in northeast India, Vietnam, southern China and southern plateau of Brazil. Besides the new conditions for crop development, these new areas present stress conditions like low temperatures, dry periods and wind. It was shown that low temperatures affect the development and latex production of rubber trees. Breeding programs have been searching for clones adapted to these suboptimal areas. A complete cycle of breeding and selection takes at least 20 years to succeed in obtaining a superior clone. As such, development of new methods for early evaluation is essential to reduce and optimize the breeding management. Aiming to help in the development of these methods, in this work, we have constructed a leaf cDNA library to study ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) from cold stressed rubber trees. The originated sequences from this library can be used to create an ESTs databank and will provide genetic knowledge about how rubber trees cope with chilling stress, being also a valuable source of polymorphic molecular markers, such as SSRs and SNPs. Some of these markers may be associated to chilling tolerance, and early evaluation would be possible in young rubber tree clones.'

Abstract: 'Years ago I sat upon a wooden bench in an extraordinary backyard on the windward coast of Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s Big Island. A patio was beneath my feet, an intricate and perfectly repeating array of ochre sandstone and water-pockmarked lava with accents of obsidian and cowry shells. The patio swept gently towards a path of the same construction, one that wound amidst a grove of manicured trees, each one different, a pastiche of varied form and color that became a single astonishing whole. To my right a small pond of lilies and koi above a bed of the same lava, like the patio it too giving way to a narrower winding course of identical foundation. Stream crossed path by way of an arched and bright red bridge, before the former split into terminal braids and disappeared back into the land.'

Abstract: 'Biochar is receiving increasing attention as soil amendment. A booming expansion is expected to sharply increase the amount of biochar usage around the world. When we are on the way to change the environment by adding biochar into soil, it is worthwhile to evaluate comprehensively environmental considerations before making excessive use of it in soil. Biochar in soil can effectively retain a wide range of toxic substances through sorption and other physicochemical reactions. Nevertheless, this process usually includes decreased mobility rather than significant chemical reduction of target compounds. Biochar tends to become the sink of soil pollutants. The changing soil environment can result in the release of toxic compounds from biochar in the long term. Biochar can be deactivated by clogged pores or decreasing sorption capacity. Once biochar is mixed with soils, it is difficult to separate them again. It is important to make a deliberate decision before action.'

Abstract: 'Over the past four years, we have conducted extensive fieldwork in the Cocinetas Basin of La Guajira Peninsula, including geological mapping, stratigraphic descriptions, and exhaustive paleontological collection of plants, microfossils, and marine and terrestrial invertebrates and vertebrates. Moreno et al. (Swiss J Paleontol 134: 1\xe2\x80\x9339, 2015) provide an overview of these efforts, including a revised Neogene stratigraphy for Cocinetas Basin and redefined (Jimol and Castilletes formations) and newly named (Ware Formation) lithostratigraphic units. Hendy et al. (Swiss J Paleontol 134, 2015) utilize the extensive invertebrate fossil record of the basin to develop paleoenvironmental interpretations and a chronostratigraphic framework buttressed by 87Sr/86Sr isotopic analyses and biostratigraphy. This geological exploration highlights the tremendously diverse and important fossil assemblages throughout the Jimol, Castilletes and Ware formations. These new fossil data will be of great value for future paleobiogeographic, paleogeographic, paleooceanographic and paleoenvironmental interpretations. Already, the faunal and floral fossil record of Cocinetas Basin indicates that once the humid ecosystem of the Neogene underwent drastic climatic changes over the last two million years.'

Abstract: 'Without considering the ecosystem-dependence of agricultural production, irrational use of agricultural technologies could bring only short-term economic benefits but leave long-term environmental deterioration. If some agricultural lands have to be abandoned because of these technologies such as chemical films or groundwater depletion, it will aggravate the burden of remaining lands for maintaining or enhancing production. Thus, agricultural production should be a part of public services, requiring the consideration of interests of different stakeholders and sustainability.'

Abstract: 'Mercury is a metal which is potentially toxic for the environment. Many factors control its retention in the soil, such as cation exchange capacity, pH, clay content, organic matter, and redox potential. It is important to know the phytotoxic effects of soil Hg to prevent environmental contamination and its entry into the food chain. Several analytical methods are used to measure metal phytoavailability in soils, but none has been reported for Hg in Oxisols, the most common soil class in Brazil and a very important soil class throughout the tropics. The aim of this study was to select the chemical extractor that best correlated the Hg levels in plants and the Oxisols. The soils used were classified as Dystrophic Red-Yellow Oxisol (LVAd) and Dystroferric Red Oxisol (LVdf), which were collected in the 0\xe2\x80\x930.2-m soil layer. The species selected for cultivation were a monocotyledon, oat (Avena sativa L. cv. S\xc3\xa3o Carlos) and a eudicotyledon, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Madrep\xc3\xa9rola). Each test plot was composed of a 500\xc2\xa0cm3 pot filled with soil samples contaminated with HgCl2. Treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design, with four replications. The experiment was conducted for 30\xc2\xa0days. Mercury contents were separately extracted with the following extractors: USEPA 3051A, Mehlich-1, Mehlich-3, DTPA, and water. Mercury was determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy. The extracted contents were correlated with the contents in the tissues of the plants\xe2\x80\x99 aerial part by the Pearson correlation. Although it is not considered a standard procedure to evaluate metal phytoavailable contents, the method that presented the best correlations between soil Hg and plant Hg was USEPA 3051A (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.75*). As expected, the worst correlation was with water (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.57* for common bean and r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890,05ns for oat).'

Abstract: 'The way in which students view science and its practitioners, particularly during their late elementary and early secondary grade levels, has been at the core of numerous studies dating back to research by Mead & Metraux (Science 126:384\xe2\x80\x93390, 1957). In this study, we used the Draw-a-Scientist Test Checklist developed by Finson, Beaver & Cramond (Sch Sci Math 95(4):195\xe2\x80\x93205, 1995) to explore and document Colombian and Bolivian students\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions of scientists. Despite the wealth of information from years of study, there is a lack of research on images held by students in Latin American nations. This study involved Colombian and Bolivian students (N\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891,017) in 5th to 11th grades and was aimed at providing an original account of how these students picture scientists and science. Results suggest differences on how students perceive scientists based on nationality, grade and school type. We discuss how features may be associated with educational and socioeconomic status in each school community.'

Abstract: 'Decomposition rates and nutrient dynamic (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) were determined for green leaves and fine branches immersed in the water of a small tributary of Caura river (SE-Venezuela). 16% of the original dry weight of leaves and 11% of branches were lost at the end of the first sampling period: first month for leaves and second month for branches. This dry weight reduction was probably due to leaching of soluble material. After a 9-month period, the mass loss was 60% for leaves and 20% for fine branches. The pattern of dry weight and nutrient losses are in general agreement with previous studies of decomposition of leaf litter in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Potassium and magnesium are the elements most rapidly lost, showing the dominance of leaching processes; at the end of the first month 7% of the initial amount of K and 18% of the initial amount of Mg remained in leaves. The loss of calcium and phosphorus was much slower: 61% of Ca and 47% of P remained in the leaf material after the first sampling period. In contrast to K, Mg, Ca and P, the initial amount of nitrogen in leaves remained relatively unchanged during the first month of decomposition; in the subsequent sampling period, the amount of N decreased. The elements K and Mg in branches behaved similar to leaves: 4% of K and 22% of Mg were left at the end of the first sampling period. The initial amount of Ca and P in branches decreased slightly: 88% of Ca and 83% of P remained in branches at the end of this first sampling. Nitrogen behaved differently in branches than that in leaves. In branches the amount of N remained relatively unchanged during the first 5 months of decomposition; afterwards, N showed gradual increases, probably due to immobilization. At the end of the experiment the amount of N in branches was 16% higher than the initial amount.'

Abstract: "I experimentally excluded ants from randomly selected spruce trees Picea abies near colonies of the wood ant Formica aquilonia. Foraging activity of birds in these trees was then compared to the foraging activity of birds in neighboring spruce trees, where ants were allowed to continue foraging. Birds which foraged in the foliage showed the effects of competition with ants: they visited the trees without ants more frequently, and for longer periods. In addition, the insects and spiders that they utilized as food were more abundant in the foliage of trees without ants. Cone-foraging birds, however, which fed on seeds in cones at the tops of the trees, did not show a preference for trees without ants. The differences of tree usage between foliage-gleaning and coneforaging birds can be explained by alteration of the birds' food supply by wood ants: ants did not feed on seeds in cones, and so did not compete with cone-foraging birds. However, foraging wood ants did feed on arthropods living in the foliage, thus reducing the amount of food available to birds there."

Abstract: 'The application of ecological concepts to ethnobotanical studies, in particular of diversity, is analyzed. Diversity indices are important tools that may help in understanding human-environment interactions. Those indices allow comparisons on the use of plants by different populations in different environments. A review on recent major ethnobotanical journals was carried out, and 10 studies (7 from Latin America, 2 from Asia and 1 from Europe) were selected based on available data to calculate diversity indices. The Shannon-Wiener indices and rarefaction curves were obtained. High diversity on plant uses were found for studies carried out at Peru, Mexico, Brazil and Thailand. A low diversity was found for Tonga, and island biogeography theory is used to discuss these results. Sampling effort is evaluated through rarefaction curves. The estimation of the diversity of resources used by native populations may be useful when planning conservation areas and their management.'

Abstract: 'The vertical pattern of root length densities (RLD) of fine roots (<2\xc2\xa0mm in diameter) and nitrogen (N) uptake potential were determined at different altitudes (1,900, 2,400, and 3,000\xc2\xa0m a.s.l.) of a tropical montane forest in order to improve our knowledge about the depth distribution of nutrient uptake in this ecosystem. At higher altitudes, precipitation rate and frequency of fog were higher than at lower altitudes while mean annual air temperature decreased with increasing altitude. Soils were always very acid with significantly lower pH at a depth of 0.0\xe2\x80\x930.3\xc2\xa0m in mineral soil at 3,000\xc2\xa0m (2.8\xe2\x80\x932.9) than at 1,900 and 2,400\xc2\xa0m (3.1\xe2\x80\x933.5). The vertical distribution of RLD was very similar both during the dry and the rainy season. During the dry season the percentage of root length in the organic layer increased from 51% at 1,900\xc2\xa0m to 61% at 2,400\xc2\xa0m and 76% at 3,000\xc2\xa0m. At 3,000\xc2\xa0m, RLD was markedly higher in the upper 0.05\xc2\xa0m than in the remaining organic layer, whereas at 1,900\xc2\xa0m and 2,400\xc2\xa0m RLD were similar in all depths of the organic layer. In mineral soil, RLD decreased to a greater degree with increasing soil depth at the upper two study sites than at 1,900\xc2\xa0m.'

Abstract: 'We studied 30 streams in eastern Amazonia, 17 of which were located within a protected area (PA) and the other 13 in the surrounding zone, with the objective of evaluating the diversity of adult Odonata and if there was a difference between the physical habitat variables of the two environments. We hypothesized that a greater diversity of odonate species would be found in the PA due to a greater complexity of habitats. This hypothesis was rejected, however, due to the greater odonate diversity found in the surrounding zone in comparison with the PA. Differences were also found in the species composition of the two environments. Our results indicate that there are differences between the environmental variables in the areas, and the few alterations observed in the surrounding zone may have contributed to the formation of new conditions and habitats appropriate for species that may have been rare. The PA, despite having reduced species richness and abundance in comparison with the surrounding zone, was nevertheless characterized by a more heterogeneous species composition. A quarter of the species were common to both environments, while 34\xc2\xa0% were exclusive to the surrounding zone. In this case, it appears that the combination of the protected area and the surrounding zone, which has a low level of disturbance, conserves a wider range of specialist species than either area on its own. The great challenge in the future is finding a way to identify the disturbance levels that would be acceptable, and to prevent over-exploitation of resources in such areas.'

Abstract: 'Polymeric nanoparticles have been shown to be effective carriers for natural substances that possess anticancer properties. Incorporation of these natural substances into polymeric nanoparticles increases targeting of these drugs, thus reducing side effects. Uncaria tomentosa (UT) is a Peruvian Amazon plant (existing in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest) that possesses promising anti-tumor activity. This paper describes the development of poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles loaded with UT extract. The emulsion solvent evaporation method was utilized and the initial conditions were determined for the organic phase (OP) and the aqueous phase (AP). The influence of surfactant (type and concentration), PLGA concentration and AP volume on nanoparticle size, polydispersity index (PI), and entrapment efficiency (EE) was determined using a fractional factorial design (FFD). In addition, the formulation was optimized using a Box\xe2\x80\x93Behnken design. After the conditions were optimized, UT nanoparticles were obtained using an OP composed of an ethyl acetate:acetone (3:2) mixture which contained the UT alkaloids and PLGA, and an AP composed of a buffered solution of Poloxamer 188 (pH 7.5). The optimized formulation produced an EE of 64.6\xc2\xa0%, a particle size of 107.4\xc2\xa0nm and a PI of 0.163. The preliminary experiments provided important information regarding the behavior of the nanoparticulate system and the FFD used in this study greatly facilitated the selection of the most optimal conditions for formulation development.'

Abstract: 'Olivia Judson, in her guest column in the August 13, 2008 issue of the New York Times (http://www.nytimes.com), \xe2\x80\x9cOptimism on Evolution,\xe2\x80\x9d writes \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the dog days of summer come to an end, one thing we can be sure of is that the school year that follows will see more fights over teaching of evolution and whether intelligent design, or even Biblical accounts of creation, have a place in America.\xe2\x80\x9d She says the way evolution is taught is a travesty. It is treated as an abstract subject that deals with, for example, when \xe2\x80\x9cfish flopped on land,\xe2\x80\x9d something that was quaint or, worse, optional and largely \xe2\x80\x9can irrelevant part of biology.\xe2\x80\x9d She claims that this is also dangerous and that evolution should be central to beginning biology classes for three reasons. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, it provides a powerful framework for investigating the world we live in.\xe2\x80\x9d The astonishing variety of nature is well known by all, provided not only by one\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cbackyard\xe2\x80\x9d experience but also through so much on film, either in outdoor adventures or as \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d films on a number of cable channels.

Abstract: 'Malaria continues to be a major health problem in more than 100 endemic countries located primarily in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world. Malaria transmission is a dynamic process and involves many interlinked factors, from uncontrollable natural environmental conditions to man-made disturbances to nature. Almost half of the population at risk of malaria lives in forest areas. Forests are hot beds of malaria transmission as they provide conditions such as vegetation cover, temperature, rainfall and humidity conditions that are conducive to distribution and survival of malaria vectors. Forests often lack infrastructure and harbor tribes with distinct genetic traits, socio-cultural beliefs and practices that greatly influence malaria transmission dynamics. Here we summarize the various topographical, entomological, parasitological, human ecological and socio-economic factors, which are crucial and shape malaria transmission in forested areas. An in-depth understanding and synthesis of the intricate relationship of these parameters in achieving better malaria control in various types of forest ecosystems is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'We surveyed primates in seven fragments of Atlantic forest ranging from 210 to 24,250 ha in Esp\xc3\xadrito Santo, southeastern Brazil. The objective was to assess their population densities and fragment-specific population sizes in order to discuss the survival of primates in this highly fragmented landscape. We used line-transect sampling for censusing primates and estimated densities via DISTANCE program. Alouatta fusca, Cebus apella, Callicebus personatus, and Callithrix geoffroyi live in the study area. Although variable, primate numbers were higher in larger than in smaller fragments, the likely reasons being the lack of space and food resources (fruits) and higher impact of mesopredators (small cats) in small fragments. The estimated densities are within the range reported for other Atlantic forest sites, except for brown howlers (Alouatta fusca), which were extremely rare. Estimates of population sizes were on the order of several hundreds to thousands of individuals/species in the large-sized fragments (ca. 20,000 ha), while comparable estimates for the other areas indicate <500 individuals/species in the medium-sized reserves (ca. 2,000 ha), and <50 individuals/species in the small fragments (ca. 200 ha). These estimates suggest that only Atlantic forest fragments \xe2\x89\xa520,000 ha can harbor primate populations large enough to escape extinction in the long term. Given that <20% of all protected areas remaining in the Atlantic forest are \xe2\x89\xa520,000 ha, management measures are urgently needed to improve primate conservation in this biome.'

Abstract: 'Based on the fact that streamwater quality reflects landscape conditions, the objectives of this study were: to investigate nitrogen (N), carbon (C), and major ion concentrations in six streams crossing minimally disturbed Atlantic Forest areas, with similar geomorphological characteristics; to determine N and C fluxes in one of these pristine streams (Indai\xc3\xa1); and assess the impact of human activity on the biogeochemistry of two other streams in the same region, crossing urbanized areas. The distribution pattern of carbon and inorganic nitrogen dissolved forms, as well as the major ion and biogenic gas concentrations in the streamwater, was similar in pristine streams, indicating that the C and N dynamics were determined by influence of some factors, such as climate, atmospheric deposition, geology, soil type, and land covering, which were analogous in the forested watersheds. The urban streams were significantly different from the pristine streams, showing low dissolved oxygen concentrations, high respiration rates, and high concentrations of carbon dioxide, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic carbon, and major ion. These differences were attributed to anthropogenic impact on water quality, especially domestic sewage discharge. Additionally, in the Indai\xc3\xa1 stream, it was possible to observe the importance of rainfall over temporal dynamics of dissolved carbon forms, and also, the obtained specific flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was relatively elevated (approximately 11\xc2\xa0kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921). These results reveal the influence of human activity over the biogeochemistry of coastal streams and also indicate the importance N export of Atlantic Forest to the ocean.'

Abstract: 'Although the characteristics and advantages of interorganizational governance models based on extensive collaboration are well established in the literature, inquiry has only recently extended to sustainable supply chain management, highlighting the potential benefits of combining the integration of social and environmental issues concerning the supply chain with governance models based on joint decision making and extensive cooperation. Yet, firms still differ in both the pervasiveness of such collaborative approaches along the value chain and the extent to which sustainability issues are addressed to the advantage of all parties involved. In an attempt to predict variety in the governance models related to sustainability along the value chain, we propose a theoretical model that identifies and frames four sustain-\table supply chain governance (SSCG) models, resulting from combinations of supply chain network density and centrality of the focal organizations. We show how, as centrality increases, firms are able to exert influence over their network, coordinating integrated approaches along the value chain. Moreover, as high centrality combines with increasing interconnectedness of the actors within a supply chain network, instrumental approaches are progressively replaced by more relational attitudes aimed at joint value creation among partners. Conditions for SSCG models\xe2\x80\x99 success and the main benefits gained by firms in different structural contexts are also discussed.'

Abstract: 'West Africa plays key roles in global climate and shows one of the strongest variations in hydro-climatic conditions. As it turns out, the region appears to be underrepresented in the existing compendium of Earth science and hydrology-focused journal papers when it comes to significant discussion on terrestrial hydrology and freshwater science. This prominent gap is largely precipitated by increasing number of constraints that include lack of considerable and robust investments in gauge measurements for meteorological and hydrological applications, poor funding of research institutions and other disincentives, among other factors. In this manuscript, the challenges and problems in large-scale terrestrial hydrology-focused investigation in West Africa are reviewed. Using a dossier of some recent contributions in the field of remote sensing hydrology, this review also highlights some of the progress in terrestrial hydrology and the opportunities that exist for hydro-geodetic research in West Africa that leverage on sustained investments in satellite geodetic missions. It is noted that West Africa is still a pristine environment for hydrology-focused research and can benefit from recent advancements in sophisticated space agency programs such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, which undoubtedly has revolutionized terrestrial hydrology research around the world for nearly two decades. Given the poor density of gauge stations and limited ground observations, hydrological research in West Africa is expected to benefit more from independent space observations and multi-resolution data. This is because the lack of sufficient in-situ data for the parameterizations and adequate initialization of outputs from hydrological models and reanalysis data for hydrological applications results in poor representation of the West African land surface and hydrological state variables. To further improve our contemporary understanding of West Africa\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial hydrology, the continued evaluation/validation of these observations and space-borne measurements is advocated.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82The International Panel on Climate Change distinguished three main options for the mitigation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations by the agricultural sector: (1) reduction of agriculture-related emissions, (2) creation and strengthening of C sinks in the soil, and (3) production of biofuels to replace fossil fuels. Options for sustained sequestration of C in the soil through adapted management of land resources are reviewed in the context of the ongoing discussion on the need to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Enhanced sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in the soil, ultimately as stable humus, may well prove a more lasting solution than (temporarily) sequestering CO2 in the standing biomass through reforestation and afforestation. Such actions will also help to reverse processes of land degradation, thus contributing to sustained food productivity and security for the people in the regions concerned.'

Abstract: 'Organisms not only respond to their environment but also influence the availability of resources and change environmental conditions. Hence, the impacts of organisms on their environment shape the selective regimes that drive, on ecological time scales, the assembly of ecological communities and, on evolutionary time scales, diversification. Recent studies have drawn attention to the fact that feedbacks between organisms and the environment can prevent or induce catastrophic transitions in ecosystem states and argue that climate change increases the likelihood of such catastrophic regime shifts. Ecologists have very limited ability to predict the likelihood of such regime shifts or the properties of the ecosystems that assemble after such collapses. This is because ecology does not have a theory of ecosystem assembly, nor does it have an established way of translating such a theory into models capable of predicting future ecosystem states. Without knowing these potential endpoints, we cannot develop strategies for coercing ecosystems into desired states, severely constraining our capacity to mitigate climate change and climate change impacts. This paper outlines a roadmap for developing a theory of terrestrial ecosystem assembly. Recent progress in dynamic global vegetation modelling and community assembly provides a useful foundation for a theory of ecosystem assembly. Environmental filtering and limiting similarity are key principles, but to be useful, they need to be linked to resource consumption and environmental modulation, and be more strongly constrained by biophysics and the trade-offs defined by biophysical principles. Such a theory recognises that ecological and evolutionary history ensures that many different ecosystem assemblies are possible at any given point in space and time.'

Abstract: 'The primary components of Tlaxcalan corn agriculture are described, including cropping patterns employed, resource management strategies, and interactions of human and biological factors. Tlaxcalan farmers grow corn in an array of poly-culture and agroforestry designs that result in a series of ecological processes important for insect pest and soil fertility management. Measurements derived from a few selected fields show that trees integrated into cropping systems modify the aerial and soil environment of associated understory corn plants, influencing their growth and yields. With decreasing distance from trees, surface concentrations of most soil nutrients increase. Certain tree species affect corn yields more than others. Arthropod abundance also varies depending on their degree of association with one or more of the vegetational components of the system. Densities of predators and the corn pest Macrodactylussp. depend greatly on the presence and phenology of adjacent alfalfa strips. Although the data were derived from nonreplicated fields, they nevertheless point out some important trends, information that can be used to design new crop associations that will achieve sustained soil fertility and low pest potentials.'

Abstract: 'Climate-change projections for boreal winter precipitation in Tropical America has been addressed by statistical downscaling (SD) using the principal component regression with sea-level pressure (SLP) as the predictor variable. The SD model developed from the reanalysis of SLP and gridded precipitation GPCC data, has been applied to SLP outputs from 20 CGMS of CMIP5, both from the present climate (1971\xe2\x80\x932000) and for the future (2071\xe2\x80\x932100) under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios. The SD model shows a suitable performance over large regions, presenting a strong bias only in small areas characterized by very dry climate conditions or poor data coverage. The difference in percentage between the projected SD precipitation and the simulated SD precipitation for present climate, ranges from moderate to intense changes in rainfall (positive or negative, depending on the region and the SD GCM model considered), as the radiative forcing increases from the RCP2.6 to RCP8.5. The disparity in the GCMs outputs seems to be the major source of uncertainty in the projected changes, while the scenario considered appears less decisive. Mexico and eastern Brazil are the areas showing the most coherent decreases between SD GCMs, while northwestern and southeastern South America show consistently significant increases. This coherence is corroborated by the results of the ensemble mean which projects positive changes from 10\xc2\xb0N towards the south, with exceptions such as eastern Brazil, northern Chile and some smaller areas, such as the center of Colombia, while projected negative changes are the majority found in the northernmost part.'

Abstract: 'Post-conflict countries (PCC) guide their priorities toward restoration of socioeconomic conditions and relegate sustainability objectives to the background. With the aim to provide insights for the current discussion on rural environmental sustainability in today\xe2\x80\x99s post-conflict Colombia, we analyzed the environmental dynamics of seven PCC. We found that (1) deforestation and land use conflicts were frequent impacts in both conflict and post-conflict scenarios, that (2) return of displaced population, the infectiveness of land use planning, and the dependence on the primary sector were frequent drivers of environmental change; and that (3) natural resources extraction tends to be intensified in post-conflict period. We discuss these findings in light of the current environmental problems of Colombia and the post-conflict environmental challenges. We conclude that in order to ensure environmental sustainability in post-conflict scenario, Colombia should act on structural aspects that go beyond the environmental objectives proposed in the peace agreement between the government and FARC: strengthening environmental institutions, integrating long-term environmental objectives across all sectors, and deintensifying the dependence of the economy in the extractive sector.'

Abstract: 'This study aims to examine the effects of message type and adoption of various social-cause categories on consumers\xe2\x80\x99 reactions in building trust, reducing consumer skepticism, and bolstering corporate reputations within the restaurant and foodservice industries. A 2 (type of message: a text-only message versus one with text and visuals)\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x894 (types of social causes: health, human services, animal welfare, and environmental concern) between-subjects experimental design was employed. The sample involved 433 U.S. adult consumers who volunteered to take a survey. Participants responded with the lowest levels of skepticism, the highest levels of trust, and the greatest respect for corporate reputation when the messages they viewed included visuals to go along with the message text. No differences were found among the four types of social causes with regard to participants\xe2\x80\x99 responses, except for perceived trust. We also found interaction effects on participants\xe2\x80\x99 responses regarding the relationships between types of messages and social-cause categories.'

Abstract: 'Fungi represent one of the most understudied and diverse group of organisms. Commonly, these organisms make associations with higher life forms and may proceed to biochemically mimic the host organism. An excellent example of this is the anticancer drug, taxol, which had been previously supposed to occur only in the plant genusTaxus (yew). However, taxol has been reported in a novel endophytic fungus\xe2\x80\x94Taxomyces andreanae, but also has been demonstrated to occur in a number of unrelated fungal endophytes includingPestalotia, Pestalotiopsis, Fusarium, Alternaria, Pithomyces, Monochaetia and others. Thus, this report presents information on the presence of taxol among disparate fungal genera, and uses these observations as an additional argument to support efforts to study fungal endophytes and preserve their associated host plants.'

Abstract: 'Habitat destruction and the over-exploitation of species are perhaps thetwo most important processes threatening biodiversity. Whilst the growing humanpopulation puts considerable pressure on biological resources, a number ofsocial and economic factors tend to augment over-exploitation of theseresources. Here we show that the over-exploitation of the tropical palm treeEuterpe edulis Mart., as a consequence of social problems,has contributed significantly to its extinction in several forest fragments andalso to the disappearance of many wild animal species which used to be found inareas of the Atlantic Rain Forest (Brazil). Some of these species have been lostas a direct result of people hunting the animals when they went harvestingE. edulis while others disappeared as a consequence of thedecrease in food availability or by alterations in the trophic structure.'

Abstract: 'Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) have been traded for millennia by indigenous communities. Current increased demands driven by globalisation, however, put more pressure on local harvesters and their surrounding ecosystems. The safeguarding of indigenous access rights to harvesting grounds is needed, either through communal land titles or collaborative management agreements, both to secure prior indigenous rights and to minimise further negative ecological impacts.'

Abstract: 'This paper analyses the behavior of extreme events of surface precipitation and temperature inside the Pacific and Caribbean Catchment Basins in Colombia using several datasets such as observations, reconstructed data, NCEP-NCAR and ERA-40 reanalyses and data from the regional model REMO. We use an extreme value method that selects the time series excesses over a nonstationary threshold and adjusts them to a generalized Pareto distribution. The goodness of fit is evaluated through a test that includes the Cramer\xe2\x80\x93von Mises, Kolmogorov\xe2\x80\x93Smirnov and Anderson\xe2\x80\x93Darling statistics and the p values generated by parametric bootstrap resampling. The test not only evaluates the goodness of fit but also the threshold choice. The parameters are presented in maps that allow recognition of the features of the extreme behaviour inside the catchment basins, and differences and similarities between them. Maps of return periods for the maximum extreme events are also presented. A strong influence of the El Ni\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x93Southern oscillation on the extreme events of both temperature and precipitation is found in the two catchment basins.'

Abstract: 'Improved management of carbon storage by terrestrial biomes has significant value for mitigating climate change. The carbon value of such management has the potential to provide additional income to rural communities and provide biodiversity and climate adaptation co-benefits. Here, we quantify the carbon stores in a 49,300-ha landscape centered on the cloud forest\xe2\x80\x93grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru. Aboveground carbon densities were measured across the landscape by field sampling of 70 sites above and below the treeline. The forest near the treeline contained 63.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05.2\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 aboveground, with an additional 13.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.8\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 estimated to be stored in the coarse roots, using a root to shoot ratio of 0.26. Puna grasslands near the treeline were found to store 7.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.7\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in aboveground biomass. Comparing our result to soil data gathered by Zimmermann and others (Ecosystems 13:62\xe2\x80\x9374, 2010), we found the ratio of belowground:aboveground carbon decreased from 15.8 on the puna to 8.6 in the transition zone and 2.1 in the forest. No significant relationships were found between carbon densities and slope, altitude or fire disturbance history, though grazing (for puna) was found to reduce aboveground carbon densities significantly. We scaled our study sites to the study region with remote sensing observations from Landsat. The carbon sequestration potential of improved grazing management and assisted upslope treeline migration was also estimated. Afforestation of puna at the treeline could generate revenues of US $1,374 per ha over the project lifetime via commercialization of the carbon credits from gains in aboveground carbon stocks. Uncertainties in the fate of the large soil carbon stocks under an afforestation scenario exist.'

Abstract: 'More than 200 scientific publications and Internet sources dealing with trade in palm products in north-western South America are reviewed. We focus on value chains, trade volumes, prices, and recent developments for some of the most important raw materials derived from native palms. Trade in palm products takes place at local, regional, national, and international levels. For local communities and individual households palm products may play a key role as the most important or only source of cash income. Most of these palm products are inadequately or not at all captured in trade statistics at the local and regional economic levels. Only products such as vegetable ivory and palm heart are monitored statistically, mainly because they are exported. Most raw materials derived from palms are extracted from the wild, and mainly by destructive harvesting. Reduced availability and rising prices on local and regional markets reflect incipient resource depletion. Only in vegetable ivory more or less sustainable wild harvesting methods prevail. Palm heart is increasingly being harvested from orchards and non-sustainable exploitation of wild populations is loosing ground. The international market for native palm oils and pulp (esp. Euterpe oleracea or a\xc3\xa7a\xc3\xad) is currently served almost exclusively from Brazil. Due to low oil contents and high production costs palm oils are currently used mainly for cosmetics. Based on their content of protein, starch, tocols, and carotenoids palm fruits have high nutritional value and represent a considerable potential for the development of functional foods, food supplements and animal fodder. Palms could undoubtedly play a more important role in the socio-economic development of north-western South America. Sustainability and marketing potential of palm products are negatively affected by the low income obtained by primary producers which often represents no more than 0.01\xe2\x80\x933% of the retail value. Poor governance, insecurity of land tenure and unequal sharing of profits endanger a sustainable long-term development of these valuable resources.'

Abstract: 'Cookies were prepared by replacing a mixture of brown rice flour (70\xc2\xa0%) and corn starch (30\xc2\xa0%) (BRFCS) by buriti endocarp flour (BEF) (0, 5, 10, 15 or 20\xc2\xa0%). BEF figured as a potential source of dietary fiber (70.53\xc2\xa0g 100\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921), especially of insoluble fiber (67.50\xc2\xa0g 100\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921), and gluten-free whole cookies showed increased dietary fiber content by adding 5, 10, 15 and 20\xc2\xa0% BEF (8.58 to 20.02\xc2\xa0g 100\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921) when compared to control cookie (6.91\xc2\xa0g 100\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921). The addition of BEF affected diameter, spread ratio, color and texture of cookies. All cookies added with BEF were darker, harder and presented smaller diameter and smaller spread ratio than the control cookie. These difference increased proportionally to level of substitution of BRFSC by BEF. Gluten-free whole cookies with up to 15\xc2\xa0% BEF were well accepted by consumers. Therefore, the use of BEF in cookies may increase the availability of functional ingredients source of dietary fiber for celiac consumers, add economic value to buriti processing by-products and decrease environmental impacts due to the high amounts of waste generated by buriti processing industries.'

Abstract: 'Ensembles of coupled atmosphere\xe2\x80\x93ocean global circulation model simulations are required to make probabilistic predictions of future climate change. \xe2\x80\x9cPerturbed physics\xe2\x80\x9d ensembles provide a new approach in which modelling uncertainties are sampled systematically by perturbing uncertain parameters. The aim is to provide a basis for probabilistic predictions in which the impact of prior assumptions and observational constraints can be clearly distinguished. Here we report on the first perturbed physics coupled atmosphere\xe2\x80\x93ocean model ensemble in which poorly constrained atmosphere, land and sea-ice component parameters are varied in the third version of the Hadley Centre model (the variation of ocean parameters will be the subject of future study). Flux adjustments are employed, both to reduce regional sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases and also to admit the use of combinations of model parameter values which give non-zero values for the global radiation balance. This improves the extent to which the ensemble provides a credible basis for the quantification of uncertainties in climate change, especially at a regional level. However, this particular implementation of flux-adjustments leads to a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation, resulting in the development of biases in SST and sea ice in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Nevertheless, model versions are produced which are of similar quality to the unperturbed and un-flux-adjusted version. The ensemble is used to simulate pre-industrial conditions and a simple scenario of a 1% per year compounded increase in CO2. The range of transient climate response (the 20\xc2\xa0year averaged global warming at the time of CO2 doubling) is 1.5\xe2\x80\x932.6\xc2\xb0C, similar to that found in multi-model studies. Measures of global and large scale climate change from the coupled models show simple relationships with associated measures computed from atmosphere-mixed-layer-ocean climate change experiments, suggesting that recent advances in computing the probability density function of climate change under equilibrium conditions using the perturbed physics approach may be extended to the transient case.'

Abstract: 'Secondary forests in Central Africa are increasing in importance for biodiversity conservation as old growth forests outside the few protected areas are disappearing rapidly. We examined vegetation recovery in a lowland rain forest area in Cameroon based on a detailed botanical survey of old growth forest and different-aged logging gaps (5\xe2\x80\x9327 years) and shifting cultivation fields (10\xe2\x80\x9360 years). Our analysis focuses on the long-term recovery of botanical conservation values by analysing trends in vegetation structure, species composition, species diversity and levels of endemism and rarity. In the total survey (4.25 ha), we recorded 834 species of which 23% were endemic to the Lower Guinea forest region. The proportion of endemic species was high in shrubs and low in herbs. Geographic range and (local) rarity were not significantly associated. The proportion of rare species (relative frequency <10%) was high in woody climbers and low in trees. In logging gaps, recovery of all vegetation characteristics was relatively quick (5\xe2\x80\x9314 years). Recovery in shifting cultivation sites took longer (30\xe2\x80\x9360 years). Endemic species were found to be highly sensitive to shifting cultivation practices and even after 50\xe2\x80\x9360 years the level of endemism was still significantly lower compared to old growth forest. The proportion of rare species was not significantly different between disturbed sites and old growth forest. We conclude that secondary forests can contribute to biodiversity conservation, e.g. as buffer zones around protected areas. However, this contribution should be assessed differently between land use types and widespread versus endemic species.'

Abstract: 'It is hypothesized that one of the mechanisms promoting diversification in cichlid fishes in the African Great Lakes has been the well-documented pattern of philopatry along shoreline habitats leading to high levels of genetic isolation among populations. However lake habitats are not the only centers of cichlid biodiversity - certain African rivers also contain large numbers of narrowly endemic species. Patterns of isolation and divergence in these systems have tended to be overlooked and are not well understood.'

Abstract: 'What is the function of morality? On this question, something approaching a consensus has recently emerged. Impressed by developments in evolutionary theory, many philosophers now tell us that the function of morality is to reduce social tensions, and to thereby enable a society to efficiently promote the well-being of its members. In this paper, I subject this consensus to rigorous scrutiny, arguing that the functional hypothesis in question is not well supported. In particular, I attack the supposed evidential relation between an evolutionary genealogy of morals and the functional hypothesis itself. I show that there are a great many functionally relevant discontinuities between our own culture and the culture within which morality allegedly emerged, and I argue that this seriously weakens the inference from morality\xe2\x80\x99s evolutionary history to its present-day function.'

Abstract: ' The instances of association with Cebus capucinustroops were monitored for 11 months as part of a field study of Saimiri oerstediiin a tropical wet forest in Costa Rica, Parque Nacional Corcovado. Contrary to the usual situation in South America, where S. sciureusforms persistent mixed-species groups with Cebus apella,in Corcovado S. oerstediirarely associated with Cebus capucinus;the frequencies were consistent with those expected from random association. Depending on the season, the S. oerstediitroop spent between 2.3 and 11.8% of its time in the vicinity of a Cebus capucinustroop. Most associations appeared to be chance meetings of short duration. When the two species did associate for an extended period, it was Cebus capucinus,and not S. oerstedii,that appeared to maintain the association, possibly in order to benefit from the antipredator behavior of S. oerstedii.There was no evidence that either species benefited from enhanced foraging efficiency when in association.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82Palaeodata in synthesis form are needed as benchmarks for the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP). Advances since the last synthesis of terrestrial palaeodata from the last glacial maximum (LGM) call for a new evaluation, especially of data from the tropics.

The reliability of the data was evaluated using explicit criteria and some types of data were re-analysed using consistent methods in order to derive a set of mutually consistent palaeoclimate estimates of mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO), mean annual temperature (MAT), plant available moisture (PAM) and runoff (P-E). Cold-month temperature (MAT) anomalies from plant data range from \xe2\x88\x921 to \xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x80\x85K near sea level in Indonesia and the S Pacific, through \xe2\x88\x926 to \xe2\x88\x928\xe2\x80\x85K at many high-elevation sites to \xe2\x88\x928 to \xe2\x88\x9215\xe2\x80\x85K in S China and the SE USA. MAT anomalies from groundwater or speleothems seem more uniform (\xe2\x88\x924 to \xe2\x88\x926\xe2\x80\x85K), but the data are as yet sparse; a clear divergence between MAT and cold-month estimates from the same region is seen only in the SE USA, where cold-air advection is expected to have enhanced cooling in winter. Regression of all cold-month anomalies against site elevation yielded an estimated average cooling of \xe2\x88\x922.5 to \xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x80\x85K at modern sea level, increasing to \xe2\x89\x88\xe2\x88\x926\xe2\x80\x85K by 3000\xe2\x80\x89m. However, Neotropical sites showed larger than the average sea-level cooling (\xe2\x88\x925 to \xe2\x88\x926\xe2\x80\x85K) and a non-significant elevation effect, whereas W and S Pacific sites showed much less sea-level cooling (\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89K) and a stronger elevation effect. These findings support the inference that tropical sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) were lower than the CLIMAP estimates, but they limit the plausible average tropical sea-surface cooling, and they support the existence of CLIMAP-like geographic patterns in SST anomalies. Trends of PAM and lake levels indicate wet LGM conditions in the W USA, and at the highest elevations, with generally dry conditions elsewhere. These results suggest a colder-than-present ocean surface producing a weaker hydrological cycle, more arid continents, and arguably steeper-than-present terrestrial lapse rates. Such linkages are supported by recent observations on freezing-level height and tropical SSTs; moreover, simulations of \xe2\x80\x9cgreenhouse\xe2\x80\x9d and LGM climates point to several possible feedback processes by which low-level temperature anomalies might be amplified aloft.'

Abstract: 'Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a cyanide-containing food crop used by many indigenous peoples in Amazonia. Tukanoan Indians in Northwest Amazonia utilize both \xe2\x80\x9cbitter\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csweet\xe2\x80\x9d cassava cultivars. Those classified as \xe2\x80\x9cbitter\xe2\x80\x9d are the dietary staple. Analysis of 13 commonly used \xe2\x80\x9cbitter\xe2\x80\x9d cultivars indicates that they are high in cyanide in comparison to values reportedin the literature. The Tukanoan practice of including the inner peel in the edible portion contributes to the high cyanide values found.'

Abstract: 'Species composition, diversity and population structure of woody species recovered on three abandoned agricultural fields after 4, 9 and 14 years were characterized. Seedlings, saplings/poles and mature trees were identified and counted in 70 plots of 100 m2 in each abandoned site. A total of 13, 29 and 22 families represented by 17, 48 and 44 species were registered in 4, 9 and 14 year-old stands, respectively. There was a shift in dominant species across successional stages. Lonchocarpus acuminatus had the highest importance value in the 4-year old stand, whereas, Myrospermun frutescens, Guazuma ulmifolia and Cordia alliodora had the highest importance value in the 9-year-old-stand and Caesaeria corymbosa, Muntingia calabura, Gliricidia sepium and Tabebuia rosea in the 14-year old stand. The total stem density increased from 5011 to 9631 individuals per hectare as the age of abandonment increased from 4 to 14 years. The total basal area of individuals \xe2\x89\xa5 1cm d.b.h. also increased with the age of abandonment. Overall, small individuals (< 10 cm dbh) contributed to more than half of the total basal area. Species diversity was the highest in the 9-year old stand followed by 14- and 4-year old stands. We concluded that floristic composition of secondary forests recovers rapidly to the mature forest level compared to structural attributes, which is consistent with the general successional trajectories of tropical dry forest.'

Abstract: 'Carbon availability often controls soil microbial growth and there is evidence that at regional scales soil microbial biomass is positively correlated with aboveground forest litter input. We examined the influence of plant litterfall on annual variation of soil microbial biomass in control and litter-excluded plots in a tropical wet forest of Puerto Rico. We also measured soil moisture, soil temperature, and plant litterfall in these treatment plots. Aboveground plant litter input had no effect on soil microbial biomass or on its pattern of fluctuation. Monthly changes in soil microbial biomass were not synchronized with aboveground litter inputs, but rather preceeded litterfall by one month. Soil microbial biomass did not correlate with soil temperature, moisture, or rainfall. Our results suggest that changes in soil microbial biomass are not directly regulated by soil temperature, moisture, or aboveground litter input at local scales within a tropical wet forest, and there were asynchronous fluctuation between soil microbial biomass and plant litterfall. Potential mechanisms for this asynchronous fluctuation include soil microbial biomass regulation by competition for soil nutrients between microorganisms and plants, and regulation by below-ground carbon inputs associated with the annual solar and drying-rewetting cycles in tropical wet forests.'

Abstract: 'Sri Lanka has a long tradition of forest product use. The relationship of people with a dry zone forest was studied using a sample of 48 households in two villages that varied in distance to the forest and access to the market. All households interviewed collected subsistence forest products and a majority of them also collected commercial products. The daily peak-season income from commercial gathering was 4.5 to 7.7 times the daily labor wage. There is a strong gender specialization, with commercial gathering dominated by men whereas subsistence gathering is almost exclusively the task of women. The average forest-derived household income in the village closer to the forest and with better market access was nearly double that of the other village. Family size as a proxy of labor availability was the main discriminating factor between those households who did and those who did not gather commercial products. A small inverse relationship between forest gathering and size of household agricultural land (particularly paddy rice) was observed. No clear relationship was found between total household income and forest derived income, contradicting the view that commercial forest gathering is an exclusive activity of the poorest households.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing offers fast and reliable technique to map the variation in plant diversity and distribution at different scales. Using 891 geo-tagged ground sampled point collected for the Western Ghats, India from a national level study on biodiversity characterization. We analyzed the distribution of plant species with respect to the satellite derived vegetation indices. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived vegetation products, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), and surface reflectance (SR-645nm and SR-858nm) were fitted to suitable regression curves with respect to plant species richness where NDVI demonstrated the best fit (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.07); while fPAR showed (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.08) better relation with woody species richness. We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests. Utility of fine resolution spatio-temporal data could render better understanding of species richness pattern using biophysical proxies, and thereby, help in long-term biodiversity monitoring.'

Abstract: 'The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool holds a unique place on the globe. It is a large area [>30\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106\xc2\xa0km2] that is characterised by permanent surface temperature\xc2\xa0>28\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and is therefore called the \xe2\x80\x98heat engine\xe2\x80\x99 of the globe. High convective clouds which can reach altitudes up to 15\xc2\xa0km generate much latent heat in the process of convection and this area is therefore called the \xe2\x80\x98steam engine\xe2\x80\x99 of the world. Seasonal and contrasting monsoonal activity over the region is the cause for a broad seasonal change of surface salinities, and since the area lies along the path of the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt, it is coined the \xe2\x80\x98dilution\xe2\x80\x99 basin due to the high incidence of tropical rain and, away from the equator, tropical cyclones contribute to a significant drop in sea water salinity. Discussion about what may happen in the future of the Warm Pool under global warming is presented together with a description of the Warm Pool during the past, such as the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels had dropped by\xc2\xa0~125\xc2\xa0m. A call for urgent monitoring of the IPWP area is justified on the grounds of the significance of this area for global oceanographic and climatological processes, but also because of the concerned threats to human population living there.'

Abstract: 'Guilt appeals have been found effective in stimulating ethical consumption behaviors in western cultures. However, studies performed in Confucian cultural contexts have found contradictory results. We aim to investigate the inconclusive results of research on guilt and ethical consumption and to explain the inconsistencies. We aim to better understand the influence of guilt on ethical consumption in a Chinese Confucian context and to explore the culturally relevant individual-level concept of interdependent self-construal as a moderator. We build our argument on the Confucian ethics of ren-yi-li where the virtue of propriety (li \xe7\xa4\xbc) specifies role-based obligations depending on the proximity of one\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to others and may thus limit ethical behaviors that are directed to those who are relationally distant. We hypothesize a positive relationship between guilt and ethical consumption that is, however, negatively moderated by interdependent self-construal. Put another way, consumers who define themselves strongly through their relationships with close others are less likely to compensate for guilt through ethical consumption. We find the hypothesized model supported in a survey of 314 Chinese consumers. The results suggest that guilt appeals can stimulate ethical consumption in Confucian cultures. However, guilt appeals may not be enough, as the moderating effect suggests that they will be most effective when combined with an ethical consumption initiative that conforms to the Confucian li principle. As this principle implies prioritizing close over distant relationships, it follows that consumers may be more likely to respond to guilt appeals which are linked to ethical consumption initiatives whose beneficiaries they feel connected to.'

Abstract: 'Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has grown on the corporate agenda and is at the heart of today\xe2\x80\x99s corporate culture. While much research has examined CSR strategies and effects, the effects of post-crisis CSR communication have received relatively little academic attention. Therefore, this paper uses two experimental studies to examine several key contingency factors that influence consumers\xe2\x80\x99 responses to post-crisis CSR initiatives. Results suggest that consumers demonstrate more favorable responses when a company launches a CSR initiative congruent with the crisis issue, or when the crisis is the result of an accident rather than a transgression. Further, the congruence between the crisis issue and the pre-crisis CSR initiative moderates the consistency effects between pre- and post-crisis initiatives. Such findings should be understood by considering the mediating role of corporate CSR motives\xe2\x80\x99 consumer attributions, which was evidenced in this study. This study theoretically contributes to an improved understanding of the underlying mechanism of the post-crisis CSR information process and managerially contributes to the strategic development of effective post-crisis CSR initiatives given a particular situation.'

Abstract: 'The discussions anticipating the annual joint meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Berlin this autumn have again drawn the increased attention of a broader public to the debt problems of the developing countries. Alternative groups are planning to hold an anti-congress, in which especially the role of the IMF and the World Bank in this connection are to be subjected to a critical examination.'

Abstract: 'In a multi-strata agroforestry system in central Amazonia, we studied the nitrogen (N) use of two indigenous fruit tree species, Theobroma grandiflorum Willd. (ex Spreng.) K. Schum. (cupua\xc3\xa7u) and Bactris gasipaes Kunth. (peachpalm) for heart of palm production, and a legume cover crop, Pueraria phaseoloides Roxb. (Benth.) (pueraria). 15N was applied at a rate of 1 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 twice at the beginning and at the peak of the rainy season, in a split plot design under either cupua\xc3\xa7u, peachpalm or pueraria together with fertilizer N usually applied (95.4 and 42.4 g N tree\xe2\x88\x921 for cupua\xc3\xa7u and peachpalm, respectively). Plant and soil 15N content and total 15N uptake were measured for 1 year. The highest N uptake by the trees occurred from areas underneath their canopy being more than 70% of their total N uptake. During the dry season, pueraria also took up most of its N (more than 70%) from the area underneath its own canopy. During the rainy season, however, pueraria utilized N from the area under cupua\xc3\xa7u (27\xe2\x80\x9340%) and peachpalm (34\xe2\x80\x9347% of the total N uptake by pueraria). Cupua\xc3\xa7u took up between 12 and 26% of its N from the area covered by pueraria, peachpalm slightly less with 10 to 18% (significant only at the end of the rainy season; P<0.05). Competition for N uptake between the trees was negligible. The above-ground recovery was highest in cupua\xc3\xa7u (15% of the applied 15N), followed by pueraria (11%) and peachpalm (3%). Pueraria proved to be very important for the N cycling in the mixed tree cropping system recovering most (31%) of the applied 15N in plant and soil in comparison to cupua\xc3\xa7u (20%) and peachpalm (21%). However, the natural 15N abundance of the tree leaves did not show a significant transfer of biologically fixed N2 from pueraria to the trees (P>0.05) and the cover crop did not improve tree N nutrition. The investigated fruit trees did not benefit from biologically fixed N2 of the legume cover crop due to their low lateral root activity and the high available soil N contents largely being an effect of the amount and placement of mineral fertilizer.'

Abstract: 'The role of different agroforestry systems in the conservation of plant diversity and forest structure has not been directly compared in many agricultural dominated landscapes. In this study, we investigated tree diversity and forest structure in a complex agroforestry landscape traditionally grown for cocoa and mixed food crops and compared these to the natural forest in southeastern Ghana. The study was carried out using 36 25\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa025\xc2\xa0m plots. There was significant difference [95% Confidence Interval (95% CI)] in the native forest/non-crop tree species richness between the natural forest and the agroforest farmlands but species richness was similar between the cocoa and mixed food crops agroforests. The density of native forest/non-crop trees was significantly higher (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in the natural forest but similar between cocoa and mixed food crops agroforest. Similarly, the basal area of native forest/non-crop trees was significantly higher (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in the natural forest but comparable between cocoa and food crops agroforest. Of the 20 most abundant native forest/non-crop trees recorded, 12 of them showed significant responses (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) to land use change with nine of the species significantly abundant in the natural forest relative to the agroforest systems. Eighteen native forest/non-crop trees species in the agroforestry systems were commonly recorded as being used; 100% of them being used as fuel wood with 83.3 and 77.8%, respectively, used as medicines and materials. The findings of this study suggests that  although complex agroforestry systems are a poor substitute for the natural forest the heterogeneous mosaic landscape in which complex agroforestry forms part can be strategically managed to maximize the benefits of both sustainable agriculture production and conservation of plant diversity by acting as buffer between protected areas and intensively managed areas.'

Abstract: 'Nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) limitation to primary productivity and other biological processes can change in a variety of ways as ecosystems develop. How N limitation and P limitation change from the early to the late stages of a secondary succession following farmland abandonment remains unclear in karst ecosystems in southwest China.'

Abstract: 'This study examines the potential, magnitude, and causes of enhanced biological N2 fixation (BNF) by common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) through bio-char additions (charcoal, biomass-derived black carbon). Bio-char was added at 0, 30, 60, and 90\xc2\xa0g kg\xe2\x88\x921 soil, and BNF was determined using the isotope dilution method after adding 15N-enriched ammonium sulfate to a Typic Haplustox cropped to a potentially nodulating bean variety (CIAT BAT 477) in comparison to its non-nodulating isoline (BAT 477NN), both inoculated with effective Rhizobium strains. The proportion of fixed N increased from 50% without bio-char additions to 72% with 90\xc2\xa0g kg\xe2\x88\x921 bio-char added. While total N derived from the atmosphere (NdfA) significantly increased by 49 and 78% with 30 and 60\xc2\xa0g kg\xe2\x88\x921 bio-char added to soil, respectively, NdfA decreased to 30% above the control with 90\xc2\xa0g kg\xe2\x88\x921 due to low total biomass production and N uptake. The primary reason for the higher BNF with bio-char additions was the greater B and Mo availability, whereas greater K, Ca, and P availability, as well as higher pH and lower N availability and Al saturation, may have contributed to a lesser extent. Enhanced mycorrhizal infections of roots were not found to contribute to better nutrient uptake and BNF. Bean yield increased by 46% and biomass production by 39% over the control at 90 and 60\xc2\xa0g kg\xe2\x88\x921 bio-char, respectively. However, biomass production and total N uptake decreased when bio-char applications were increased to 90\xc2\xa0g kg\xe2\x88\x921. Soil N uptake by N-fixing beans decreased by 14, 17, and 50% when 30, 60, and 90\xc2\xa0g kg\xe2\x88\x921 bio-char were added to soil, whereas the C/N ratios increased from 16 to 23.7, 28, and 35, respectively. Results demonstrate the potential of bio-char applications to improve N input into agroecosystems while pointing out the needs for long-term field studies to better understand the effects of bio-char on BNF.'

Abstract: 'We followed the establishment and growth response of 13 commercial tree species to canopy opening, above-ground biomass removal, and experimental burns of low and high intensities in a lowland dry forest in Bolivia. Three patterns of response to treatments were observed among the most abundant commercial tree species. (1) Shade-intolerant species regenerated mostly from seed and had the highest survival and growth rates following high-intensity burns. (2) Shade-tolerant species were abundant in gap control and plant removal treatments. Treatments had little effect on the height growth of these species. (3) Individuals of root sprouting species were most abundant following plant removal and low-intensity burn treatments. Treatments had little effect on the height growth of these species. The wide variation in species\xe2\x80\x99 responses to gap treatments found in this study not only reinforces the concept that species are distributed along a continuum of shade-tolerance levels, but that other aspects of species\xe2\x80\x99 biology, such as seed dispersal type or sprouting behavior, further differentiate regeneration strategies. The variety of regeneration strategies found among the species at this forest site will require a flexible management scheme that mixes more intensive silvicultural treatments such as prescribed burning with less intensive treatments.'

Abstract: 'Estimates of lava volume, and thus effusion rate, are critical for assessing volcanic hazard and are a priority for volcano observatories with responsibility for monitoring. The choice of specific methods used to approximate lava volume depends on both volcanological and practical considerations; in particular, whether field measurements are possible and how often they can be repeated. Volc\xc3\xa1n El Reventador (Ecuador) is inaccessible, and field measurements can only be made infrequently at a few locations in its caldera. We present both planimetric field and topographic satellite radar-based measurements of lava flow thicknesses and volumes for activity at El Reventador between 2002 and 2009. Lava volumes estimates range from 75\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8924\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89106\xc2\xa0m3 (based on field measurements of flow thickness) to 90\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8937\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89106\xc2\xa0m3 (from satellite radar retrieval of flow thickness), corresponding to time-averaged effusion rates of 9\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x894\xc2\xa0m3/s and 7\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xa0m3/s, respectively. Detailed flow mapping from aerial imagery demonstrate that lava effusion rate was at its peak at the start of each eruption phase and decreased over time. Measurements of lava thickness made from a small set of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferograms allowed the retrieval of the shape of the compound lava flow field and show that in 2009 it was subsiding by up to 6\xc2\xa0cm/year. Satellite radar measurements thus have the potential to be a valuable supplement to ground-based monitoring at El Reventador and other inaccessible volcanoes.'

Abstract: 'Malaria is a major health issue in French Guiana. Amerindian communities remain the most affected.

A new survey was conducted in order to clarify the risk factors for the presence of malaria cases in Camopi.'

Abstract: 'Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) consumption has been one of the most common causes of produce-associated salmonellosis in the United States. Contamination may originate from animal waste, insects, soil or water. Current guidelines for fresh tomato production recommend the use of potable water for applications coming in direct contact with the fruit, but due to high demand, water from other sources is frequently used. We sought to describe the overall bacterial diversity on the surface of tomato fruit and the effect of two different water sources (ground and surface water) when used for direct crop applications by generating a 454-pyrosequencing 16S rRNA dataset of these different environments. This study represents the first in depth characterization of bacterial communities in the tomato fruit surface and the water sources commonly used in commercial vegetable production.'

Abstract: 'Acacieae Benth. (Leguminosae\xe2\x80\x93Mimosoideae) comprises more than 1450 species and is composed of five genera in the current circumscription: Senegalia Raf., Mariosousa Seigler & Ebinger, Vachellia Wight & Arn., Acacia Mill., and Acaciella Britton & Rose. This work describes the diversity of the Tribe Acacieae in the state of Minas Gerais. The studies were based on the analysis of specimens from herbaria, field observations, and the collection of botanical materials. The study provides descriptions, illustrations, an identification key, common names, and data on the geographic distribution and flowering and fruiting of these species. Eighteen species belonging to this tribe were recognized in the state. For the first time, we report the occurrence of Senegalia velutina DC. in Minas Gerais. The species are distributed in the three biomes in the state: Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Caatinga. Senegalia bahiensis (Benth.) Seigler & Ebinger, S. giganticarpa (G. P. Lewis) Seigler & Ebinger, S. lacerans (Benth.) Seigler & Ebinger, S. lewisii (Bocage & Miotto) L. P. Queiroz, S. limae (Bocage & Miotto) L. P. Queiroz, S. martii (Benth.) Seigler & Ebinger, S. paganucci (Willd.) Seigler & Ebinger, S. pteridifolia (Benth.) Seigler & Ebinger, S. serra (Benth.) Seigler & Ebinger, and S. velutina have been designated for inclusion on the list of endangered species in Minas Gerais.'

Abstract: 'Chemical analysis of Na, K, Ca and Mg in bulk deposition, using 230 events, showed that variations in atmospheric deposition are explained better by measured concentration than by precipitation amount. In addition, measured concentration is related to precipitation by a significant power function with the exponent near \xe2\x88\x921. These observations led us to propose an inverse linear model which makes it possible to calculate two parameters: one of them is indicative of the mean composition of \xe2\x80\x9ccloud rain\xe2\x80\x9d and is assumed to be typical for the study area; the other parameter is representative of particulates, aerosols and gases that are washed out from the atmosphere in the initial phases of precipitation, including dry deposition. This initial component represents an average of 64% of the bulk deposition for the cations studied. The functions that explain the relations between atmospheric deposition and measured concentration are, within statistical limits, equal for the four cations'

Abstract: 'The conventional means to record hydrological parameters of aflood often fail to record an extreme event. Remote sensingtechnology along with geographic information system (GIS)has become the key tool for flood monitoring in recent years.Development in this field has evolved from optical to radarremote sensing, which has provided all weather capabilitycompared to the optical sensors for the purpose of flood mapping.The central focus in this field revolves around delineation of floodzones and preparation of flood hazard maps for the vulnerable areas.In this exercise flood depth is considered crucial for flood hazardmapping and a digital elevation model (DEM) is considered to bethe most effective means to estimate flood depth from remotelysensed or hydrological data. In a flat terrain accuracy of floodestimation depends primarily on the resolution of the DEM. Riverflooding in the developing countries of monsoon Asia is very acutebecause of their heavy dependence on agriculture but any floodestimation or hazard mapping attempt in this region is handicappedby poor availability of high resolution DEMs. This paper presents areview of application of remote sensing and GIS in flood managementwith particular focus on the developing countries of Asia.'

Abstract: 'Ethnobotanical information can clarify how dependent a community is on local plant resources and provide evidence about the consequences of resource exploitation. We performed a quantitative analysis on different aspects of knowledge and use of palms by the residents of the surrounding the Tucuru\xc3\xad Hydroelectric Power Station reservoir, eastern Amazonia, and their relationship with socioeconomic factors, adopting the methodology of consensus among informants. We based the study on accidental sampling of the 232 families and data were gathered through semi-structured forms. We evaluated correlations between the effective use and importance of species and the effect of socioeconomic factors on the knowledge and use of palms as cited by the informants. Informants know 27 species of palms and use 20 of these in eight different categories, the main ones being for food, utensils and construction. The species most widely used and cited as most important were Attalea speciosa, Oenocarpus bacaba, Euterpe oleracea, A. maripa and Socratea exorrhiza. For the informants, the value of a palm species is directly related to the different types of uses that it offers. The knowledge about palms is greater among farmers than fishermen and, when considering the medicinal aspect, it is greater among women than among men.'

Abstract: 'The current treatment of leishmaniasis induces strong side effects and increasing numbers of cases of resistance to reference drugs have been reported. The discovery of the therapeutic properties of active substances in plant extracts represents an interesting field of research into a more efficient treatment against leishmaniasis. Morinda citrifolia, commonly known as noni, has demonstrated promising results as antileishmanial and immunomodulator. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate activity against axenic amastigote and hydrogen peroxide induction capacity by M. citrifolia fruit juice.'

Abstract: 'Data from 3991 records of museum collections representing 421 species of plants, arthropods, amphibians, fish, and primates were analyzed with GIS to identify areas of high species diversity and endemism in Amazonia. Of the 472 1 \xc3\x97 1\xc2\xb0 grid cells in Amazonia, only nine cells are included in the highest species diversity category (43\xe2\x80\x9367 total species) and nine in the highest endemic species diversity category (4\xe2\x80\x9313 endemic species). Over one quarter of the grid cells have no museum records of any of the organisms in our study. Little correspondence exists between the centers of species diversity identified by our collections-based data and those areas recommended for conservation in an earlier qualitative study of Amazonian biodiversity. Museum collections can play a vital role in identifying species-rich areas for potential conservation in Amazonia, but a concerted and structured effort to increase the number and distribution of collections is needed to take maximum advantage of the information they contain.'

Abstract: 'This paper summarizes prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in humans and animals and associated correlates of infection, clinical spectrum of disease in humans, and genetic diversity of T. gondii isolates from Colombia. Recent studies, especially in the states of Antioquia, Quind\xc3\xado and Cundinamarca, indicate that toxoplasmosis is a major public health problem. Approximately half of the women of child bearing age have T. gondii antibodies, and the clinical disease in congenitally infected children is more severe than in Europe. Limited studies indicate that the strains of T. gondii from Colombia are genetically and phenotypically different than in Europe and North America. However, epidemiological factors, such as the involvement of domestic and/or wild animals in transmission, the distribution of strain diversity by natural geographic regions, and the variation in risk factors between regions that are associated with human infection in Colombia, remain unknown. Areas of research for the future are outlined. This review should be of interest to biologists, veterinarians, physicians, and parasitologists.'

Abstract: 'Primate ecological studies can benefit from accessing the canopy to estimate intra-tree and inter-tree variation in food availability and nutrient value, patch and subpatch depletion, foraging efficiency, as well as nest structure and nesting behaviors, parasitic transmission and predator detectability. We compare several ways to access the canopy and examine their suitability for studies of primates. Two of them\xe2\x80\x94the Single Rope Technique and the Climbing Spur Method\xe2\x80\x94allow people to safely access almost all kinds of trees, regardless of their size, height or shape. Modern climbing gear and contemporaneous safety protocols, derived from rock climbers, speleologists, and industrial arborists, are reliable and appropriate for primate ecological studies. Climbing gear is specialized and still expensive for students, but tree climbing can be dangerous during specific maneuvres. Consequently, formal training and preliminary experience are essential before attempting to collect data. We discuss the physics of falling, risk assessment associated with a fall, knots, gear and safety precautions. Finally, we propose a Tree Climbing Safety Protocol adapted for 2 climbing methods and primate field ecology. Researchers should be aware that climbing safety depends on their own judgment, which must be based on competent instruction, experience, and a realistic assessment of climbing ability. Therefore, the information we provide should be used only to supplement competent personal instruction and training in situ. Although most primate observations have been and will mostly be done from the ground in the future, canopy information complements the observations. Canopy data will add a significant new dimension to our knowledge of primates by providing strategic information otherwise unavailable.'

Abstract: 'While much research on forest partnerships hitherto has been focused mainly on the drivers behind their formation, the kind of actors and deals involved, and the factors that promote or hinder their success, much less attention has been paid to the dynamic relationships and processes inherent in these partnerships. Based on the study of a partnership process in an indigenous reservation in Colombian Amazonia covering a variety of projects, this paper seeks to fill part of this lacuna by analyzing the partnership as a dynamic \xe2\x80\x98discursive battlefield,\xe2\x80\x99 in which objectives and actions are being constantly negotiated. Actors in the Matav\xc3\xa9n partnership strategically incorporate discursive elements in order to pursue their own interests while also endorsing those that ensure the continuation of collaboration. We conclude that discourses are embedded in partnership micro-politics. On the one hand, discursive shifts occur as a reflection of power balances at given moments. On the other hand, discourses constitute indispensable resources with the potential to both enhance individual actor\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating power and to create opportunities for compromise. Within an ongoing discursive tension between \xe2\x80\x98conservation\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98indigenous autonomy,\xe2\x80\x99 flexible notions such as \xe2\x80\x98territorial ordering\xe2\x80\x99 prove to be successful in allowing space for manoeuvre and granting conceptual coherence to shifts occurring \xe2\x80\x98on the ground.\xe2\x80\x99'

Abstract: 'Commercialization of agricultural products, including seeds and its derived products, represents an important economic source for developing countries. Natural colorants obtained from the seeds of achiote plant (annatto) have been used since pre-Hispanic times. Also, production of this crop has been important for Mayan cuisine. Annual world production of achiote seeds is approximately 14,500 tons (dry weight). Two thirds of the production is commercialized as dried seeds and the rest as colorant. Latin America produces 60% of the total world production, followed by Africa (27%) and Asia (12%). The main producers in Latin America are Peru, Brazil and Mexico. The purpose of the present paper is to review the most recent literature on Bixa orellana L. focusing on bixin, norbixin, tocotrienols and tocopherols biosynthesis, use and industrial applications of annatto extracts, as well as its nutraceutical potential and its benefits for human health.'

Abstract: 'Several language experiments have been carried out on apes and other animals aiming to narrow down the presumed qualitative gap that separates humans from other animals. These experiments, however, have been driven by the understanding of language as a purely symbolic sign system, often connected to a profound disinterest for language use in real situations and a propensity to perceive grammatical and syntactic information as the only fundamental aspects of human language. For these reasons, the language taught to apes tends to discard iconic and indexical elements in favour of symbolic signs. This paper sheds light on the iconic components of human language, with close attention to the iconic properties of language as present in the ape language experiments. We emphasise the role of the body in the interpretation and production of iconic signs, while demonstrating the need to take into account the Umwelt theory in the research paradigm of the experiments. Uexk\xc3\xbcll\xe2\x80\x99s Umwelt theory is used to exemplify the methodological problems connected to the teaching of human language to other animal species; furthermore, we discuss how the modelling capacities of language affect the biological layer that constitutes the animal Umwelt. Language is analysed as a particular case of Umwelt transition (T\xc3\xb8nnessen), and as such its implications are further discussed in the article. With this paper, we enrich the discussion surrounding the human-ape pidgin language by advocating for the need to include iconic components as vital parts of this research area. With this inclusion, we uncover the inter-dependency of iconic, indexical and symbolic signs in human language, aiming to further develop the research paradigm of the ape language experiments.'

Abstract: 'This paper starts from the generally accepted premise that forest dieback is a complex phenomenon caused by multiple stresses that are exerted by a host of contributing factors. It is argued that the rapidly proceeding forest dieback, as documented in the damage inventories, is in itself enough reason to warrant action. Therefore, at this late stage, this paper emphasizes the pressing need to introduce active control measures which will reduce pollution emission through more efficient use of fossil fuels, through abatement techniques at the source, and through substitution with less polluting sources.'

Abstract: 'Limitations of mapping land surface properties and their conversion into climate model boundary conditions are major sources of uncertainty in climate simulations. In this paper, the range of the largest possible uncertainty in satellite-derived land cover (LC) map is estimated and its impact on climate simulations is quantified with the Earth System Model of the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology utilizing prescribed sea surface temperature and sea ice. Two types of uncertainty in the LC map are addressed: (i) uncertainty due to classification algorithm of spectral reflectance into LC classes, and (ii) uncertainty due to conversion of LC classes into the climate model vegetation distribution. For forest cover, each of them is about the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty range in recent observations (\xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89700 Mha). Superposing two sources of uncertainty results in LC maps that feature the range of vegetation deviation that is about the same order of magnitude as the recent (since year 1700) forest loss due to agriculture (forest cover uncertainty range \xe2\x88\xbc\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891700 Mha). These uncertainties in vegetation distribution lead to noticeable variations in near-surface climate variables, local, regional, and global climate forcing. Temperature does not show significant uncertainty in global mean, but rather exhibits regional deviations with an opposite response to LC uncertainty that compensate each other in the global mean (e.g., albedo feedback controls temperature in boreal North America resulting in cooling (warming) with decrease (increase) of vegetation while evaporative cooling controls temperature in South America and sub-Saharan Africa resulting in cooling (warming) with increase (decrease) of vegetation). Large-scale circulation is also affected by the LC uncertainty, and consequently precipitation pattern as well. It is demonstrated that precipitation uncertainty in the monsoonal regions are about the same order of magnitude as in previous studies with idealized perturbations of vegetation. These findings indicate that the range of uncertainty in satellite-derived vegetation maps for climate models is about the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty in recent observations of forest cover or as the forest lost due to agriculture. Consequently, climate simulations have a similar range of uncertainty in variables representing near-surface climate as the observed climate change due to land use. Hence, more accurate methods are needed for mapping and converting LC properties into model vegetation in order to increase reliability of climate model simulations.'

Abstract: 'Fires are one of the major causes of forest disturbance and destruction in several dry deciduous forests of southern India. In this study, we use remote sensing data sets in conjunction with topographic, vegetation, climate and socioeconomic factors for determining the potential causes of forest fires in Andhra Pradesh, India. Spatial patterns in fire characteristics were analyzed using SPOT satellite remote sensing datasets. We then used nineteen different metrics in concurrence with fire count datasets in a robust statistical framework to arrive at a predictive model that best explained the variation in fire counts across diverse geographical and climatic gradients. Results suggested that, of all the states in India, fires in Andhra Pradesh constituted nearly 13.53% of total fires. District wise estimates of fire counts for Andhra Pradesh suggested that, Adilabad, Cuddapah, Kurnool, Prakasham and Mehbubnagar had relatively highest number of fires compared to others. Results from statistical analysis suggested that of the nineteen parameters, population density, demand of metabolic energy (DME), compound topographic index, slope, aspect, average temperature of the warmest quarter (ATWQ) along with literacy rate explained 61.1% of total variation in fire datasets. Among these, DME and literacy rate were found to be negative predictors of forest fires. In overall, this study represents the first statewide effort that evaluated the causative factors of fire at district level using biophysical and socioeconomic datasets. Results from this study identify important biophysical and socioeconomic factors for assessing \xe2\x80\x98forest fire danger\xe2\x80\x99 in the study area. Our results also identify potential \xe2\x80\x98hotspots\xe2\x80\x99 of fire risk, where fire protection measures can be taken in advance. Further this study also demonstrate the usefulness of best-subset regression approach integrated with GIS, as an effective method to assess \xe2\x80\x98where and when\xe2\x80\x99 forest fires will most likely occur.'

Abstract: '\nDeforestation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, mainly due to agriculture. As rice is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s most important crops, determining how agricultural communities are shaped is imperative. However, few studies have addressed the factors that alter community assembly in human-modified landscapes. We aim to quantify taxonomic, functional, trait and phylogenetic diversity of an anuran community from rice crops on a biodiversity hotspot.'

Abstract: 'Field observations of the atmospheric boundary layer were made over urban and suburban areas in the Yangtze River Delta, China. Sensible heat fluxes were obtained by eddy-covariance (EC) systems and large-aperture scintillometers (LASs). The results indicated that (1) the sensible heat flux obtained by LAS \\((H_\\mathrm{LAS})\\) was less noisy and slightly larger than that obtained by EC \\((H_\\mathrm{EC})\\) over both urban and suburban surfaces; (2) the values of \\(H_\\mathrm{LAS} /H_\\mathrm{EC} \\) were higher when the correlation coefficient of vertical wind speed and temperature (\\(r_{wT}\\)) was smaller. Lower values of \\(r_{wT}\\) were due to low-frequency trends. The urban values of \\(H_\\mathrm{LAS} /H_\\mathrm{EC}\\) were smaller than suburban values at low \\(r_{wT} \\) values; (3) the sensible heat flux determined by LAS was improved by use of the Monin\xe2\x80\x93Obukhov similarity theory of the temperature structure parameter \\((\\phi _{\\mathrm{CT}})\\) over urban and suburban areas, and the improvement is more significant over urban surface areas.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents assessments of the fragmentation of the temperate and tropical forests in Mexico at the national level for two dates 1993 and 2002. The study was based on land use and vegetation cover data sets scale 1:250,000. Two broad forest types (Temperate Forests and Tropical Forests) and five more specific forest types (Broadleaf Forests, and Coniferous Forests; Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests, Tropical Sub-evergreen Forests, and Tropical Evergreen Forests) were defined to conduct the analyses. FragStats 3.3 was used to estimate nine metrics of the spatial pattern of the forests for each forest type and date considered. The results indicate that the land cover transitions that have occurred between 1993 and 2002 have resulted in more isolated forest patches with simpler shapes in both the Temperate and Tropical Forests. The remaining Tropical Forest patches have become smaller and more numerous. In contrast, the remaining Temperate Forest patches are fewer and on average larger. Of the more specific forest types defined in this study, the Broadleaf Forests have the highest indicators of fragmentation. However these forests are usually embedded or adjacent to Coniferous Forests. Of more concern for conservation purposes are the high values of fragmentation metrics found for the Tropical Evergreen Forests and Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests, because these forest types are usually surrounded by non-forest land covers or anthropogenic land uses.'

Abstract: 'This work addresses motivation for participating in volunteered geographic information systems (VGIS), which enable a crowdsourcing process to create information-driven value. VGIS, implemented by executing a project and its crowdsourcing strategy, are driven by online networked community participation enabled by a technological infrastructure. However, without community engagement, crowdsourcing, the core process of a VGIS, fails to create value and its main advantage becomes one of its biggest challenges. To address this problem, we present a conceptual framework to assist in designing engagement strategies to motivate and facilitate goal-oriented participation. To this end, we examine the relation between Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s human needs and VGI, its different goals, and current studies on motivation. We analyze intrinsic and internalized motivation, focusing on the needs outlined in self-determination theory. Finally, we apply Vroom\xe2\x80\x99s expectancy theory of motivation in relation to VGI. As a result, the proposed framework consists of three design tools: core drivers, participant types to whom efforts to motivate should be aligned with the project rationale, and an engagement process consisting of three main actions: Enroll, Grow and Retain. With this framework, future VGIS developments can have a structured approach that guides participation and the design of engagement strategies.'

Abstract: 'The Simplified Simple Biosphere model (SSiB) is validated in off-line simulations against field measurements in the summer of 2001 from the China Heavy Rainfall Experiment and Study (CHeRES) over a grassland site located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. When initialized and driven by the observed atmospheric forcing, the model reproduced the observed surface heat fluxes and surface skin temperature realistically. The model was also able to well simulate the variation of soil water content. The sensitivity experiments found that the leaf reflectance was the most significant parameter in improving the estimation of surface albedo during both wet and dry periods. This study suggests that the model is capable of simulating the physical processes and of assessing the impact of biophysical parameters that relate to land-atmosphere interactions over the eastern Asian monsoon regions, which is crucial for mesoscale atmospheric models.'

Abstract: 'For a long time, the genus Metaxya was treated as monotypic with a single species, M. rostrata. A second species, M. lanosa, was described in 2001 on the basis of morphological features and rbcL gene sequences with a suggestion that the genus may contain even more species. We have now systematically compared morphological traits in a large number of Metaxya specimens collected in tropical America. We have also carried out phylogenetic analyses of 32 Metaxya and 5 outgroup specimens based on four markers of the plastid genome (rbcL, matK, and rps4 genes, and trnG-trnR intergenic spacer). Based on the morphological variation among the Metaxya specimens, we accept six distinct species, three of which we describe as new in this paper. Molecular phylogenetic analyses resolved five distinct clades. Four of these corresponded with the morphologically delineated species (M. contamanensis sp. nov., M. elongata sp. nov., M. lanosa, and M. parkeri). The fifth clade contained all the individuals of the remaining two species, of which M. rostrata was rendered paraphyletic by M. scalaris sp. nov. being nested within it. Since M. scalaris was resolved as monophyletic, and the two are clearly distinguishable morphologically, we consider them true species despite the incomplete genetic differentiation.'

Abstract: 'We compared the structure of 12 Central African primate communities, 6 in riparian forests and 6 in adjacent terra firma forests and discussed the implications for primate conservation. The communities in riparian forests included on average 1.5 times more primate species than those in terra firma forests due to the fact that riparian forests shelter 4 specialist species and 6\xe2\x80\x937 generalist species. The results differ from findings in Amazonia where riparian forests consistently have fewer primate species than terra firma forests accommodate. This may be partly explained by the water level amplitude in Amazonian riparian forests, which deterred the radiation of semiterrestrial species. In Africa, most riparian-specialist primates are terrestrially-adapted and have access to an enlarged food niche. In terms of African primate conservation, we recommend protecting riparian forests and adjacent terra firma forests so that most of the lowland forest diversity is captured. The linear shape of riparian forests (which allows gene flow over long distance) and their persistence in anthropic landscape (because they represent lands of lesser value for agriculture and logging than mainland forests) predispose them to act as biodiversity sanctuaries.'

Abstract: 'Typically, ethnobotanical/ethnopharmacological (EB/EP) surveys are used to describe uses, doses/dosages, sources and methods of preparation of traditional herbal medicines; their application to date in examining the adverse effects, contraindications and other safety aspects of these preparations is limited. From a pharmacovigilance perspective, numerous challenges exist in applying its existing methods to studying the safety profile of herbal medicines, particularly where used by indigenous cultures. This paper aims to contribute to the methodological aspects of EB/EP field work, and to extend the reach of pharmacovigilance, by proposing a tool comprising a list of questions that could be applied during interview and observational studies. The questions focus on the collection of information on the safety profile of traditional herbal medicines as it is embedded in traditional knowledge, as well as on identifying personal experiences (spontaneous reports) of adverse or undesirable effects associated with the use of traditional herbal medicines. Questions on the precise composition of traditional prescriptions or \xe2\x80\x98recipes\xe2\x80\x99, their preparation, storage, administration and dosing are also included. Strengths and limitations of the tool are discussed. From this interweaving of EB/EP and pharmacovigilance arises a concept of ethnopharmacovigilance for traditional herbal medicines: the scope of EB/EP is extended to include exploration of the potential harmful effects of medicinal plants, and the incorporation of pharmacovigilance questions into EB/EP studies provides a new opportunity for collection of \xe2\x80\x98general\xe2\x80\x99 traditional knowledge on the safety of traditional herbal medicines and, importantly, a conduit for collection of spontaneous reports of suspected adverse effects. Whether the proposed tool can yield data sufficiently rich and of an appropriate quality for application of EB/EP (e.g. data verification and quantitative analysis tools) and pharmacovigilance techniques (e.g. causality assessment and data mining) requires field testing.'

Abstract: 'This paper focuses on the importance of rainwater harvesting to mitigate the scarcity of water in the semi-arid region of Brazil. It is a case study about the Million Cisterns Project, an initiative developed by NGOs with the support of Brazilian Federal Government Institutions and international funding organizations. The project is innovative in a series of ways when compared to mitigation measures previously implemented by the government. Instead of focussing on short-term, top-down, palliative measures based on the construction of dams and wells, it focuses on low cost, bottom-up, long-term measures and, most importantly, it involves an educational component. Thus, the provision of water is closely related to the empowerment of the most destitute population and this leads to the sustainability of the actions. The case study serves to illustrate the relevance of the partnership between grassroots organizations and governmental institutions in the context of mitigation.'

Abstract: 'This study investigated the orchid-bee community in a conservation gradient of the high-altitude rocky fields in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Sampling was performed at two sites with different anthropic influences: a disturbed area (DA), with exotic plant species, and a preserved area (PA). From September 2009 through February 2011, males of euglossine bees were sampled using aromatic bait-traps. We collected a total of 819 specimens belonging to 11 species and three genera: Euglossa Latreille, Eulaema Lepeletier, and Eufriesea Cockerell. Despite the proximity of DA and PA (about 1.2\xc2\xa0km), differences in orchid-bee abundance and richness were observed. Higher abundance was observed in the PA (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89485) compared with the DA (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89334). Eight species were common to both sites, and only the DA showed exclusive species. The DA showed higher diversity and higher estimated species richness. Euglossa leucotricha Reb\xc3\xaalo & Moure was the most abundant species at both sites followed by Euglossa melanotricha Moure. Higher abundance and richness were found in the warm rainy season. This study contributes to the knowledge of the orchid-bee fauna in the rocky fields and suggests that the greater resource availability in the DA was responsible for the higher orchid-bee diversity.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the magnitude, composition, and spatial and temporal patterns of road mortality of native vertebrates on two highways in southern Brazil from 18 January 2003 to 26 January 2004. The highways cross remnants of the Atlantic Rainforest, a global biodiversity hotspot, and differ in vehicle traffic and surrounding landscape. We compared the road-kill magnitude and composition of birds, mammals, and reptiles between roads and seasons. We used a modified K statistic to depict the spatial patterns of roadkills of these groups and tested the association between vehicle traffic and road mortality through linear regression. We recorded 869 kills of 92 species. The two roads differed regarding the abundance and composition of roadkills. Reptile road mortality was higher in summer than winter, but all other groups did not show significant difference in the magnitude of mortality between seasons. The composition of killed assemblages differed significantly for some of the taxonomic groups among seasons. We found only one positive association between roadkills and vehicle traffic (reptiles on one of the roads), suggesting that vehicle flow does not explain the road-kill temporal variation on these roads. Total vertebrate, bird, and mammal roadkills showed significant spatial aggregations possibly due to variation in vehicle traffic, highway design, and local landscape condition and arrangement. With expected expansion of the road network, mitigation measures for multi-species assemblages should include habitat protection, soil use regulation, road crossing structures, speed reducers, and campaigns to raise people\xe2\x80\x99s awareness about road impacts on wildlife.'

Abstract: ' Trichoderma stromaticum, T. rossicum and newly discovered species form a unique lineage in Trichoderma. Phylogenetic and phenotypic diversity in Trichoderma stromaticum are examined in the light of reported differences in ecological parameters and AFLP patterns. Multilocus phylogenetic analysis using 4 genes (tef1, rbp2, cal, chi18-5) did not reveal phylogenetic basis for the two reported divergent AFLP patterns or for ecological parameters; however, this analysis does indicate incomplete speciation with one supported clade derived from within T. stromaticum that corresponds to AFLP Group 2 of de Souza et al. (2006, Phytopathology 96:61\xe2\x80\x9367). Trichoderma stromaticum is known only from tropical America and is typically found in association with Theobroma cacao infected with Moniliophthora perniciosa. It is reported here for the first time on pseudostromata of M. roreri in Peru. Strains of T. stromaticum also have been isolated as endophytes from stems of Theo. cacao. There are no recognized close relatives of T. stromaticum in tropical America. The closest relatives of T. stromaticum are collected in Africa and Thailand; somewhat more distantly related are T. rossicum and T. barbatum, both found in north temperate regions.'

Abstract: 'Islands act as natural laboratories for ecological studies to explain bioinvasion processes and, in this scenario, necrophagous Diptera have never been used as model organisms. This study aimed to (i) describe assemblages of necrophagous Diptera (Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae) in two insular environments of different origins and distances from mainland, (ii) investigate the effect of anthropogenic impact on the assemblage of carrion flies, (iii) to quantify the establishment of invasive species in the two islands, and (iv) to infer about the conservation status of the islands based on the ecological parameters. Sampling was performed in 2011\xe2\x80\x932012, in the dry and rainy season. Insects were collected by using traps with chicken liver or sardine baits. In each island, environments exposed to different degrees of human impact were sampled. Ecological analyses were carried out to characterize the assemblages of Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae, with emphasis on the relation between native and invasive species. In total, 99,862 adults of 21 species of blow flies and flesh flies were collected. Overall abundance in the oceanic island was higher than in the continental island, although the richness of species was higher in the latter. The type of bait did not influence diversity of species sampled in either island. No difference was observed in total richness of both families according to the gradient of anthropogenic impact, in both islands. The invasive species Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) was classified as dominant in all environments, irrespective of the anthropogenic impact, which raises concern about the conservation status of each island.'

Abstract: 'Human activities affect large carnivores worldwide by increasing mortality due to destruction and fragmentation of habitats, decrease of prey availability, and hunting pressure. The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large carnivore strongly influenced by these threats, with poaching of predators being primarily a retaliatory response that is motivated by depredation of domestic animals. We investigate the distribution of jaguars and cattle depredation in 21 sampling units located in Central Brazil. We consider native and domestic prey availability as well as landscape configuration and composition as possible contributory factors. We removed correlated variables and conducted a set of logistic regressions in a step-wise approach. We used the difference between \xcf\x872 of the newest and the previous model to evaluate if the addition of a variable increased the explanatory power of the newest model. Jaguar occurrence was influenced by prey richness, which is correlated with habitat aggregation in the landscape, revealing the attributes that can act as proxies for environmental quality for jaguar. The relationship between jaguar and prey richness also suggests that jaguar can act as a surrogate for the presence of other species. Jaguar occurrence is also related to the availability of non-native prey such as cattle, but not cattle depredation, suggesting that cattle depredation could be an opportunistic event. Patterns of cattle depredation warrant further study because human-wildlife conflict is one of the greatest threats to jaguar conservation.'

Abstract: 'Canopy dieback in patches was discovered in an otherwise undisturbed very humid lower montane forest on a quartzitic sandstone plateau of the middle Caron\xc3\xad river basin, Venezuela. The patches vary in size from about 0.1 to 2 ha (50 to 700 upper story dead trees per ha). Preliminary inventories were carried out at 3 selected sites comparing 4 dieback patches (M) with adjacent not affected (V) forests. In the M plots, 40 to 61% of all trees with dbh \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm were dead. They consisted mostly (81\xe2\x80\x93100%) of the endemic tree species Terminalia quintalata of the upper story (dbh > 20 to 60 cm, height up to 30 m), which is much sparser in the V stands. Data on stand structure and species composition are presented. They seem to indicate a spatial variation in the density of Terminalia quintalata, but also of other dominant species, and reproductive problems of Terminalia, which is hardly present in the diameter classes below 10 cm dbh. V and M stands grow on similar soils with a perched high water table. They are practically free of clay and rich in humus. The exchange complex is dominated by H+. Low pH and dilution of base cations represent the main chemical stress factors. Different concepts of the dieback process are discussed, including cyclic reproductive patterns, nutrient sequestering and drought frequency.'

Abstract: 'The present essay aims to offer some reflections concerning the cultural and political aspects of veganism, on the basis of the available surveys and statistics, plus some more gathered by the authors\xe2\x80\x94with the tools of different methodologies, including the semiotic one. After an introduction to veganism as phenomenon and movement, with general reflections and also a number of specific data, the essay proceeds to focus on the more political aspects, with an emphasis on some of the most intriguing and multifaceted data, such as the prevalence of female gender, leftist political inclinations and atheism within the vegan community. While the first connection has already been widely discussed (and to our mind, proved) since the times of Adams (The sexual politics of meat: a feminist-vegetarian critical theory, Continuum, New York, 1990), much less has been said (particularly at academic level) about the significance leftist ideologies and atheism within veganism. Moreover, within the domain of semiotics, this topic is entirely unexplored.'

Abstract: 'Geophagy occurs in all primate groups and is particularly common in species that consume greater quantities of plant material, i.e., leaves, fruit. The function of geophagy is not fully understood and likely varies over space and time, perhaps in connection with changes in diet. Central to a better understanding of geophagy in primate ecology is knowledge of the occurrence of such behavior among different species and seasons. We used camera traps triggered by heat and motion to document the use of mineral licks by primates over a 3-yr period at a lowland forest site in eastern Ecuador (Tiputini Biodiversity Station). Such mineral licks can be important sources of minerals, nutrients, and other compounds for a wide range of species in Amazonian forests. Although 10 species of primates are known from the study site, we obtained photographs of only 2 species, Ateles belzebuth (white-bellied spider monkey) and Alouatta seniculus (red howler) at 2 of 4 saladeros surveyed. From late December 2004 through early January 2008, we recorded 192 photographs with a total of 318 Ateles belzebuth representing \xe2\x89\xa566 separate visits. Comparable numbers for Alouatta seniculus were 80, 121, and 37. We recorded both species visiting a mineral lick at the same time on \xe2\x89\xa57 occasions. Use of mineral licks varied across months; we recorded more visits from November through February, the drier period at Tiputini. Visits also varied by hour, with no visits before 0830 or after 1630; Ateles belzebuth showed a stronger mid-day peak in visits. Average visit length (calculated as the time between the first and last photographs of a given visit) was similar between the 2 species but median visit length was more than twice as long for Ateles belzebuth (15\xc2\xa0min) as for Alouatta seniculus (6\xc2\xa0min). Results indicate that mineral licks are important in the ecology of these species, but further studies are needed to determine the precise benefit(s) obtained and how benefits may vary with diet and other factors.'

Abstract: 'Patterns of diversity and community organisation of woody species ofsavannahs in Roraima, northern Brazil, were investigated, to relate structuraldata with edaphic factors and to analyse floristic relationships usingclassification and ordination techniques. The species studied refer to aninventory of 45 plots of 150 \xc3\x97 10 m (0.15 ha)distributed in the Roraima savannahs. We identified 13,410 woody individuals,belonging to 30 families, 52 genera and 71 species. The percentage of rarespecies is high, 58%. The richness, diversity, density and basal area of thestudied plots suggest that Roraima savannahs are poor in species. The mostimportant species include element dwarf shrubs (Byrsonimaverbascifolia, Tibouchina aspera andCassia obtusifolia), shrubby (Psidiumguianense, Randia formosa, Caseariasylvestris, Erythroxylum suberosum,Tocoyena formosa and Mimosamicrocephala) and arboreal (Curatellaamericana,B. crassifolia, B. coccolobifolia,Bowdichia virgilioides, Roupalamontana, Antonia ovata, Genipaamericana, Vitex schomburgkiana,Peltogyne campestris, Xylopiaaromatica and Himatanthus articulatus).Correlation between edaphic factors and vegetation indices reveal that densityseems to be more sensitive to edaphic factors than to basal area and diversity.Density correlated significantly with levels of Al, K and the quantity of sandin the soil. Edaphic factors can explain the distribution and importance ofsomespecies, such as: B. virgilioides, R.montana and P. guianense. Classificationanalysis tended to confirm PCA results, separating Roraima savannahs into threelarge clusters. This suggests that ecological differentiation is based not onlyon species density but also on basal area. Ordination describes floristicvariation but does not identify all edaphic gradients.'

Abstract: 'Bovine brucellosis is endemic in Colombia, and is a mandatory notifiable disease, subjected to a control program based on four surveillance procedures: passive surveillance, test-and-remove, certification of disease-free farms, and animal movements. The objective of this study is to estimate the evolution of bovine brucellosis in Colombia over a 7-year period (2006\xe2\x80\x932012) using data from the official control program. A total of 58 epidemiologic variables were analyzed for each year at the department level. Univariate descriptive analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to ascertain the behavior of the variables. These programs covered 3% of the census in 2006, increasing to 15% in 2012. The percentage of positive farms averaged 22% in 2006 and 23% in 2012. The highest proportion of positive farms was in the Orinoqu\xc3\xada region (24.6 to 49.6%); the lowest was in the Amazon region, (17.9 to 32.7%). The percentage of positive animals presented certain differences between years but without any clear trend (4.7% in 2006 and 4.6% in 2012), indicating that the brucellosis control program had a low impact in Colombia in these years. The results for each surveillance procedure were 6.8% for passive surveillance, 5.9% for test-and-remove, and 4.4% both in disease-free farms and in animal movement tests. The results obtained by PCA led to finding three different clusters: geographic areas with low bovine production and low bovine brucellosis surveillance, areas with medium bovine production and medium surveillance for bovine brucellosis, and areas with a predominant bovine production, applying sanitary measures to control bovine brucellosis.'

Abstract: "This study investigates the effects of large-scale human modification of land cover on regional and global climate. A general circulation model (Colorado State University GCM) coupled to a biophysically-based land surface model (SiB2) was used to run two 15-yr climate simulations. The control run used current vegetation distribution as observed by satellite for the year 1987 to derive the vegetation's physiological and morphological properties. The twin simulation used a realistic approximation of vegetation type distribution that would exist in the absence of human disturbance.In temperate latitudes, where anthropogenic modification of the landscape has converted large areas of forest and grassland to cropland, conversion cools canopy temperatures up to 0.7 \xc2\xb0 C in summer and 1.1 \xc2\xb0 C in winter. This cooling results from both (1) morphological changes in vegetation which increase albedo and (2) physiological changes in vegetation which increase latent heat flux of crops compared with undisturbed vegetation during the growing season. In the tropics and subtropics, conversion warms canopy temperature by about 0.8 \xc2\xb0 C year round. The warming results from a combination of morphological changes in vegetation offset by physiological changes that reduce latent heat flux of existing compared with undisturbed vegetation. If water efficient, tropical C4 grasses replace C3 vegetation, latent heat flux is further reduced.The overall effect of land cover conversion is cooling in temperate latitudes and warming in the tropics. Because the effects are opposite in sign in tropics and middle latitudes, they cancel each other when averaged globally. Over land, the surface temperature increased by 0.2 C in winter and remained essentially unchanged in summer. The effects on land surface hydrology were also small when averaged globally. The results suggest that the effects of land use change of the observed magnitude do not have a strong impact on the globally averaged climate but their signature at regional scales is significant and vary according to the type of land cover conversion."

Abstract: "International advocacy strategies devised for the political environment in which World Bank policy is decided are often not suitable for advocacy on broader financial policy and trade issues. Advocacy in these \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d agendas challenges prevailing models, which depict NGOs as mobilizing powerful governments and international organizations to influence a government's behavior. The patterns of international NGO political activity are diverse, sometimes restraining the power of international rules and authorities over individual governments, and require a new or broader model"

Abstract: 'The Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1 gene encodes a transcription coactivator (NPR1) that plays a major role in the mechanisms regulating plant defense response. After pathogen infection and in response to salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, NPR1 translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it interacts with other transcription factors resulting in increased expression of over 2000 plant defense genes contributing to a pathogen resistance response.'

Abstract: 'New initiatives in agroforestry are seeking to integrate into tropical farming systems indigenous trees whose products have traditionally been gathered from natural forests. This is being done in order to provide marketable products from farms that will generate cash for resource-poor rural and peri-urban households. This poverty-alleviating agroforestry strategy is at the same time linked to one in which perennial, biologically diverse and complex mature-stage agroecosystems are developed as sustainable alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture.'

Abstract: 'Sustainable use of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) can be affected by levels of extractions as well as by other anthropogenic influences such as fire and grazing. We examined the effects of fire on the demography of Phyllanthus emblica, an important NTFP in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. We then assessed demographic responses to the combined effects of fire and current fruit harvesting patterns. Fruits of Phyllanthus are commercially harvested by an indigenous forest dwelling people. Using matrix population models, we compared demographic indices across a chronosequence of time since last fire. Population growth rates (\xce\xbb) ranged from 0.7692 to 1.1443 across the five times since last fire. \xce\xbb was the lowest at times since last fire of 2 and 3\xc2\xa0yr. Frequent fires increased time to maturity by altering growth and survival rates, thereby causing a demographic shift from growth to regressions or negative growth. Elasticity analysis revealed that stasis of adults makes the biggest contribution to \xce\xbb. Simulations of periodic and stochastic fire regimes suggest that higher \xce\xbb and population persistence can be achieved at fire-return intervals of \xe2\x89\xa57 and \xe2\x89\xa59\xc2\xa0yr, respectively. These fire-return intervals became longer when the simulations included harvesting and fire. Extinction probabilities under the current fire regimes (every 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0yr) suggest that populations will decline to lower densities. Our findings provide critical information for developing guidelines for sustainable use and management of NTFPs in Biligiri Rangan Hills, and demonstrate the need to incorporate various human-generated physical regimes in assessing sustainability of NTFPs.'

Abstract: 'The stocks and dynamics of coarse woody debris (CWD) are significant components of the carbon cycle within tropical forests. However, to date, there have been no reports of CWD stocks and fluxes from the approximately 1.3\xc2\xa0million\xc2\xa0km2 of lowland western Amazonian forests. Here, we present estimates of CWD stocks and annual CWD inputs from forests in southern Peru. Total stocks were low compared to other tropical forest sites, whether estimated by line-intercept sampling (24.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05.3\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) or by complete inventories within 11 permanent plots (17.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.4\xc2\xa0Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921). However, annual inputs, estimated from long-term data on tree mortality rates in the same plots, were similar to other studies (3.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2\xc2\xa0or 2.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, depending on the equation used to estimate biomass). Assuming the CWD pool is at steady state, the turnover time of coarse woody debris is low (4.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.6 or 6.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.6\xc2\xa0years). These results indicate that these sites have not experienced a recent, large-scale disturbance event and emphasise the distinctive, rapid nature of carbon cycling in these western Amazonian forests.'

Abstract: 'Throughout the United States, agricultural practices are responsible for large quantities of nutrients entering lakes and streams. Previous studies have shown that forested riparian areas can filter nutrients from surface runoff and groundwater that may potentially contaminate lakes and streams. This study examined seasonal differences in soil chemistry and soil microorganisms in paired mixed-forest riparian and pasture systems, the aim being to gain understanding of the sequestering of N and P. The forest soils retained higher levels of organic C and N, mineralizable N, extractable P, and fungal biomass, and had higher respiration rates than pasture soils. These findings suggest that forested riparian zones have a greater capacity than pasture soils to sequester C and retain nutrients. In past studies, fungal biomass has been shown to be less than bacterial biomass in grassland soils, but in this study, fungal biomass was greater than bacterial biomass throughout the year in both forest and pasture soils.'

Abstract: 'In most mutualisms, partners disperse independently of each other. For instance, in ant-plant symbioses, plants disperse as seeds, and ants disperse as winged queens. For an ant-plant mutualism to persist, therefore, queens must be able to locate and colonise host plant saplings. It has been suggested that host plants emit volatile chemical cues that attract dispersing queens, but this has never been demonstrated experimentally. We used a Y-tube olfactometry protocol to test this hypothesis in the tropical understorey antplant Cordia nodosa Lam. (Boraginaceae), which associates with two genera of ants, Azteca (Dolichoderinae) and Allomerus (Myrmicinae). Both genera show significant attraction to the volatiles of C. nodosa over control understorey plant species that do not associate with ants. These results support the hypothesis that ants are attracted to volatiles emitted by their host plant and suggest a key preadaptation that promoted the evolution of ant-plant symbioses.'

Abstract: 'We describe the current state of the ruil (Nothofagus alessandrii) forest, a rare and endemic temperate forest in central Chile. Because of a long history of land-use, the ruil forest has suffered intense deforestation and fragmentation. By 1991, there remained 352.2 ha of forest in 183 fragments, most of them small and regular and a few large and irregular. From 1981 to 1991 the forest disappeared at a rate of 8.15% per year, to our knowledge, the highest value reported in forest fragmentation. Fragments are surrounded by a matrix of Pinus radiata plantations. Only 42 ha of forest (12% of the total area) are protected in a public reserve. An analysis of the composition of the forest shows that 13.8% of the total species are introduced. Pinus radiata is the only tree that has invaded this forest successfully. The 45.4% of native tree species are shade-tolerant and dependent on biotic pollinators and dispersers. These species should be the targets for future conservation efforts as they are particularly sensitive to fragmentation. We conclude that the current situation of the ruil forest is critical, and it will disappear in the next decade unless we conduct an active strategy of conservation, including integrated efforts both inside and outside protected areas and between landowners and public agencies.'

Abstract: 'Land surface process modeling of high and cold area with vegetation cover has not yielded satisfactory results in previous applications. In this study, land surface energy budget is simulated using a land surface model for the A\xe2\x80\x99rou meadow in the upper-reach area of the Heihe River Basin in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The model performance is evaluated using the in-situ observations and remotely sensed data. Sensible and soil heat fluxes are overestimated while latent heat flux is underestimated when the default parameter setting is used. By analyzing physical and physiological processes and the sensitivities of key parameters, the inappropriate default setting of optimum growth and inhibition temperatures is identified as an important reason for the bias. The average daytime temperature during the period of fastest vegetation growth (June and July) is adopted as the optimum growth temperature, and the inhibition temperatures were adjusted using the same increment as the optimum temperature based on the temperature acclimation. These adjustments significantly reduced the biases in sensible, latent, and soil heat fluxes.'

Abstract: 'To evaluate fungal microbiota in air-conditioning units installed in intensive care units in two university hospitals in Cuiaba city, Mato Grosso, central western region of Brazil, 525 solid environmental samples were collected, 285 from Hospital A and 240 from Hospital B. Collections were performed using sterile swabs on air-conditioning unit components: cooling coils, ventilators, and filters. Mycelial fungi identification was achieved by observation of the macroscopic and micromorphological characteristics in different culture mediums (maize meal, oatmeal and potato dextrose agars and malt extract) using the Ridell technique. Eleven genera and 27 distinct species belonging to the hyphomycetes and ascomycetes classes were isolated and identified. The most frequently detected genera in both hospitals were Aspergillus spp, Penicillium spp, and Cladosporium spp. Values for colony-forming units per gram were 64 and 75%, well above the limits recommended by Health Ministry resolution 176/00 at the locations selected for analysis in Hospitals A and B, respectively. In conclusion, evaluation of fungal microbiota in the air-conditioning units indirectly determined that the air quality was compromised in both university hospitals analyzed, which constitutes a risk factor for the acquisition of infection in the intensive care units.'

Abstract: "The fastest-growing demand for wood products is in domestic markets of developing countries. These markets could offer significant economic opportunities for hundreds of millions of small-scale agroforestry producers, in market niches where they can offer competitive advantages such as control over commercially valuable tree resources, lower cost structure, better monitoring and protection or branding for socially responsible markets. The most promising opportunities for small-scale farmers to sell high-value timber are as outgrowers for industrial buyers or by selling to intermediaries wood grown in agroforestry systems. Farmers located in forest-scarce regions near pulp mills may benefit from outgrower arrangements for pulpwood. Farmers located near inland urban markets may be competitive in some commodity wood and woodfuel markets. Opportunities in processed wood products are mainly in pre-processing, milling to supply low-end products, niches that cannot be efficiently served by industrial-scale producers, and through contracts for selected operations in vertically-integrated industries. To develop viable wood market enterprises, producers must improve their market position, strengthen their organizations, and forge strategic business partnerships. Forest market institutions must adapt by providing business services to small-scale farm producers, investing in regional forest enterprise development to fill gaps in the value chain for wood products, and targeting research, education and training. It is essential to remove policy barriers to small-farm participation in markets, by removing excessive regulations, creating fair and open competitive market environment, and involving farmers' organizations in forest policy negotiations."

Abstract: "The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) advocates an increase of the number of botanical gardens throughout the world as one of the measures that can help to preserve the world's biodiversity. To implement this strategy, the present work brings forward a suggestion particularly suited to tropical regions: establishing municipal botanical gardens. It refers to the experience of a newly opened municipal botanical garden in Brazil, comparing its attractive power on visitors to that of other botanical gardens included in the Brazilian network of Botanical Gardens. It also presents considerations on in situ conservation in small remnants and on the importance of urban reserves to preserve the regional biodiversity and spread the conservationist philosophy. The present proposal promotes the participation of local communities making the public opinion more aware and active, besides being able to counterbalance proposals that support protecting the world biodiversity through interventionist actions. It assumes that, through actions planned and coordinated by regional and national botanical garden networks, the measure proposed can mitigate the anthropic actions exerted on important natural reserves all over the world."

Abstract: 'Students deepen their content knowledge and collaborative skills as they interact with others across the globe. In order to deepen early childhood students\xe2\x80\x99 awareness and understanding of the world, teachers worked with their classes to develop and share school-based virtual field trips. The researcher sought to (a) identify the steps to create a school-based virtual field trip, and (b) understand how virtual field trips can promote global and/or content understandings. Qualitative results reveal that the steps taken to create a trip varied by grade. Students were motivated to teach other students about their school and were able to learn about different cultures. A variety of literacy skills were also utilized in the virtual field trips.'

Abstract: 'Destruction and fragmentation of tropical rain forest result in a loss of species and of generating capacity of the ecosystem via animal vectors such as seed dispersal agents. To gather quantitative data regarding this ecological problem, birds and mammals were censused in 30 forest fragments, 15 agricultural islands representing five types of vegetation (coffee, cacao, citrus, pepper and mixed-crops) and in three pastures in Los Tuxtlas, southern Veracruz, Mexico. More than 6000 animals of 257 species were detected thus suggesting the existence of a rich species pool in the fragmented landscape. Frugivores accounted for 60% of species, for 72% of individuals censured and for 85% of the total animal biomass recorded. Clusters of small forest fragments (<100 ha) were richer in species and individuals than clusters of large area (>100 ha) forest islands. Pastures were especially poor in forest birds and mammals. While the agricultural islands studied contributed to only 1% of the total area of vegetation sampled, they contained 58% of all species detected and 34% of all individual birds and mammals censured. Recaptures indicated inter-island movements of forest birds and mammals. Forty percent of the species were detected in forest habitats only, the rest were detected in forest and in agricultural habitats. Seeds of forest interior plants dispersed by birds and bats were detected in the agricultural habitats. The value of agricultural islands as landscape features providing some degree of biotic connectivity among fragmented animal populations is discussed.'

Abstract: 'The northern Andes harbour a flora that is as species-rich or even richer than the 18-times larger lowland Amazon basin. Gaining an understanding of how the high species richness of the Andean region is generated and maintained is therefore of particular interest. Environmental sorting due to elevational gradients in climate has been emphasized as a driver of vegetation distribution and plant community assembly in tropical mountain areas such as the Andes for two centuries, while alternative mechanisms have been little studied. Here, we investigated the importance of topography and spatial location as factors controlling species distributions in a palm community in a montane rain forest landscape in the Andes of southern Ecuador (1900\xe2\x80\x932150\xc2\xa0m above sea level). Eleven species were present: Aiphanes verrucosa, Ceroxylon parvifrons, Chamaedorea pinnatifrons, Dictyocaryum lamarckianum, Euterpe precatoria, Geonoma densa, Geonoma orbignyana, Geonoma paradoxa, Prestoea acuminata and Wettinia aequatorialis. To study their spatial distribution, forty 250\xc2\xa0m2 (5\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa050\xc2\xa0m2) plots were laid out perpendicular to four paths that were categorized into three areas and two topographic units (ridges and gullies). Mantel tests and indicator species analysis showed that both topography and spatial location imposed strong controls on palm species distributions at the study site. Our results suggest that species distributions in the studied montane forest landscape were partly determined by the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat requirements, but also by unknown spatial effects. Although a number of possible explanations exist for the latter, such as unmeasured environmental variables and historical disturbance events, we believe dispersal limitation is likely to be involved. Furthermore, although the gully- or ridge-association of some species corresponded to their general elevational ranges in southern Ecuador, this was not the case for other species. Based on such considerations, we conclude that elevational climatic gradients are likely to only form part of the explanation for the topographic effects on palm species distributions at the study site. Other factors must also be involved, notably wind-exposure and hydrology, as discussed for lowland palm communities. Our results show that to understand plant community assembly in the tropical montane forests of the Andes it is too simple to focus just on environmental sorting by elevational climatic gradients.'

Abstract: ' This paper describes a rigorous undergraduate course on environmental dispute resolution. Students get hands-on experience in negotiation cases, developing skills and building theoretical understanding through a series of exercises. With this foundation, the students advance to an extended role-playing case study on oil exploration in the Ecuadorian rain forest. The course provides an integration function both in terms of understanding environmental issues, but also in modeling reality, encouraging action, and building process tools that are essential in addressing environmental and social challenges facing the planet.

Abstract: 'The threat of invasive species is often intensified in disturbed habitat. To optimize control programs, it is necessary to understand how degraded habitat influences the behavior of invasive species. We conducted a radio telemetry study to characterize movement and habitat use of introduced male Argentine black and white tegus (Tupinambis merianae) in the Everglades of southern Florida from May to August 2012 at the core and periphery of the introduced range. Tegus at the periphery moved farther per day (mean 131.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa011.6\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06) compared to tegus at the core (mean 50.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa012.4\xc2\xa0m, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06). However, activity ranges were not significantly smaller in the core (mean 19.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08.4\xc2\xa0ha, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06) compared to periphery (mean 29.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05.2\xc2\xa0ha, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06). Peripheral activity ranges were more linear due to activity being largely restricted to levee habitat surrounded by open water or marsh. Tegus were located in shrub or tree habitat (mean 96\xc2\xa0%) more often than expected based on random locations (mean 58\xc2\xa0%), and the percent cover of trees and shrubs was higher in activity ranges (mean 61\xc2\xa0%) than the general study area (17\xc2\xa0%). Our study highlighted the ability of tegus to spread across the Florida landscape, especially in linear disturbed habitats where increased movement occurred and in areas of altered hydrology where movement is not restricted by water.'

Abstract: 'Artisanal fishers interact with plants in many ways, and with different intensities. In spite of being characterized by fisheries, Cai\xc3\xa7aras use plants with varied degrees of management, since the less intensive management actions, extraction of forest products, until intensively management actions through the cultivation of the agrobiodiversity. This study presents the results of different research projects and includes the North and the South regions of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo state coast. The objective is to characterize the diversity of extracted and cultivated species by traditional fishers at Southeastern region of Brazilian Atlantic forest. Ethnobotanical surveys revealed a high diversity of plants known and used, ranging up to a richness of 272 species known in two communities for the South coast, most of them being native. However, depending on the management intensity, this diversity can be rather particularized: we found 68 varieties of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) at North region and 58 varieties at the South region, with exclusive vernacular names. Through an ethnobotanical perspective, we compare and discuss the different dynamic systems underlying the relationships between fishers and plants. The diversity of cultivated plants is analyzed in depth, focusing on the historical importance of agriculture among people who are currently characterized as fishers. A schematic model is proposed to explain the dynamic systems operating in the relationships between fishers and plants.'

Abstract: 'The main objective of this research was to analyze the climate data for the host cities of the soccer World Cup held in Brazil in June and July 2014. A great deal of criticism was expressed about the Brazilian climate in the national and international press and media in the run-up to the competition, suggesting that the air temperature and relative air humidity would be the main adversaries of the soccer teams, especially those from Europe, during the competition. An analysis of the weather was done at the places and times of each of the 64 matches held. A human thermal comfort index was calculated (discomfort index (DI)) for each of the matches in order to discover the real climatic conditions in the host cities during the 2014 World Cup and their potential influence on the teams and human comfort in general. During the 2014 World Cup, only two matches were played at temperatures above 30\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, representing a negligible percentage of the total number of matches. The air temperature for over half the matches (53%) was 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. The results showed the air temperature and relative humidity data analyzed here both individually and in the form of an index indicate that the World Cup held in Brazil in 2014 did not put any of the players at risk due to extreme heat.'

Abstract: 'The impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) change in buffer zones surrounding protected ecological reserves have important implications for the management and conservation of these protected areas. This study examines the spatial and temporal patterns of LULC change along the boundary of Rio Abiseo National Park in the Northern Peruvian Andes. Landscape change within four ecological zones was evaluated based on trends expected to occur between 1987 and 2001. Landsat TM and ETM imagery were used to produce LULC classification maps for both years using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised approach. LULC changes were measured using landscape metrics and from-to change maps created by post-classification change detection. Contrary to expectations, tropical upper wet montane forest increased despite being threatened by human-induced fires and cattle grazing of the highland grasslands inside the park. Within the park\xe2\x80\x99s buffer zone, tropical moist forest remnants were fragmented into more numerous and smaller patches between 1987 and 2001; this was in part due to conversion into agricultural land. The methods used in this study provide an effective way to monitor LULC change detection and support the management of protected areas and their surrounding environments.'

Abstract: 'The impacts of forest fragmentation on the pteridophyte communities of the Una region of Bahia, Brazil, were investigated by comparing species richness and ensemble diversity among areas of large forest fragments (>900\xc2\xa0ha), small forest fragments (<100\xc2\xa0ha), and landscape matrix. We inventoried the pteridophytes below 1\xc2\xa0m in height in interiors of small fragments, interiors of large fragments (control areas), edges of fragments, edges of continuous forest, capoeiras (initial stages of forest regeneration) and cabrucas (cocoa plantations). All ferns were collected following the plot method (plots of 120\xc3\x9710\xc2\xa0m, each). Sampling units were established in the six main ecotypes of the Una region. These units were allocated within three sampling blocks of 5 per 5\xc2\xa0km, which were chosen in order to include the largest forest patches that still remain. Results suggest that fragmentation has a negative impact on species richness at the matrix and the edges of forest remnants. A similar negative matrix end edge effect is reported for diversity of those sites measured by the \xce\xb1 Log-series Index. However, small forest fragments have pteridophyte species richness and diversity rates similar to large ones so they should be considered of utmost importance to the conservation of forest-related species in the region.'

Abstract: 'The effects of burning, incorporation and surface mulching after one year of natural regrowth (NF) and Pueraria cover crop fallows on soil P fractions and maize and cassava yields were assessed. Data were collected between 1998 and 2000 as part of an on-going long-term fallow management trial established in 1989 at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, in the derived savanna zone of southwestern Nigeria. After NF in 1998, burning temporarily increased resin- (63%) and NaOH- (19%) extractable inorganic P fractions when compared with mulching and incorporation. Organic P and total extractable P decreased as the season progressed. Fallow systems and residue management options had no consistent and significant effect on P fractions. For both years after NF, and in 1998, after Pueraria fallow, residue management options had no significant effect on cassava yield. However, in 1999 (wetter year), compared with burning and surface mulching, incorporation of Pueraria fallow residues improved maize and cassava yields. Similarly, maize yield was improved in 1999 with incorporation of NF residues. Maize yield increases due to incorporation of NF residues were 23% compared with burning and 49% compared with mulching. Maize yield increases due to incorporation of Pueraria residues were 37% compared with burning and 47% compared with mulching. Cassava yield was increased by 31% compared with burning and by 26% compared with mulching. Longer period of time may be required to assess whether differences in soil P fractions and crop yields will occur between fallow systems.'

Abstract: "With the rise in global population and increased agricultural requirements comes an increasing need for freshwater. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 75% of fresh water consumption is for the growth of agricultural crops, and only 10% to 30% of this water is actually made available to plants. It is widely accepted that farming practices which rely heavily on chemical fertilizers and unsustainable land management practices have led in many regions to infertile sandy soils with reduced water holding capacity and insufficient amounts of organic matter. Combined with increasing global population, the need to better manage fresh water use, particularly agricultural usage, is paramount. The use of biochar as a soil amendment has been suggested as a way to increase water holding capacity, but only limited quantitative studies exist in terms of the effectiveness of biochar in increasing a soil's water holding capacity. The main purpose of this study was to determine the effect of woody biochar amendment (yellow pine from pyrolysis at 400\xc2\xb0C) on the water holding capacity of loamy sand soil with different mixture rates. Results show a doubling in water holding capacity by mass using a 9% mixture of biochar (equivalent to 195 metric ton/ha), which is an agriculturally relevant concentration. High percentage mixtures of biochar increase water holding capacity dramatically. These results suggest the use of biochar has potential to mitigate drought and increase crop yields in loamy sand soil."

Abstract: 'The dependence of aboveground biomass and productivity of tropical forests on soil fertility is not fully understood, since previous studies yielded contrasting results. Here, we quantify aboveground biomass (AGB) and stem wood production, and examine the impact of soil chemistry on these parameters in mature tropical forest stands of the equatorial Andes in Ecuador. In 80 plots of 0.04\xc2\xa0ha at four elevation levels (500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0a.s.l., total sample area\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa03.2\xc2\xa0ha), we measured ten important soil chemical parameters, inventoried all trees \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh and monitored stem diameter growth with dendrometer tapes in 32 plots. Top canopy height and stem density significantly decreased from 500 to 2,000\xc2\xa0m, while tree basal area increased and AGB remained invariant (344\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa017\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0DM\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, mean\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0SE) with elevation. Wood specific gravity (WSG) showed a significant, but small, decrease. Stem wood production decreased from 4.5 to 3.2\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0DM\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 along the transect, indicating a higher biomass turnover at lower elevations. The only soil variable that covaried with AGB was exchangeable K in the topsoil. WSG increased with decreases in N mineralisation rate, soil pH and extractable Ca and P concentrations. Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that nitrogen availability acts on stem wood production only indirectly through a negative relation between N mineralisation rate and WSG, and a positive effect of a lowered WSG on stem growth. The SEM analysis showed neither direct nor indirect effects of resin-extractable P on wood production, but a negative P influence on AGB. We conclude that nitrogen availability significantly influences productivity in these Andean forests, but both N and P are affecting wood production mainly indirectly through alterations in WSG and stem density; the growth-promoting effect of N is apparently larger than that of P.'

Abstract: 'Concern for the future of mankind, in a world of expanding human population and increasing demands on the biota, has intensified interest in the greater use of less well-known plants that are presumed to have potential to ameliorate current and predicted shortages of food and other products derived from organic sources. The premise that a wide range of plants is underutilized is examined. Consideration of plant use in hunting-gathering societies and through the development of agriculture places utilization in a different perspective and indicates that man selects from the biota plants that reflect and support his needs in any given cultural context and at any level of technological achievement. The future of agricultural systems and practices is considered. The potential of plants is discussed as an outgrowth of historical trends and predicted changes in the earth\xe2\x80\x99s plant resource base and its genetic diversity, modifications in primary, secondary, and tertiary pools of utilized plants, and advances in biotechnology. The evidence indicates continued humanization of the world, greater management of biotic resources, and increased applications of technology to agriculture, accompanied by a general decline worldwide in species and genetic diversity and increasing simplification and internationalization of the primary and secondary pools of cultivated plants. The direct utilization of wild plants by man will become more limited. Increased use of plants thought to be underutilized is likely to develop largely in relation to new needs and imperatives of mankind.'

Abstract: 'The temporal dynamics of leaf decomposition in a tropical stream were evaluated by measuring the input of leaves from riparian vegetation. The resulting mixture of leaves was processed by decomposer microorganisms and, in particular, by aquatic hyphomycetes, the most important microorganisms associated with leaf litter decomposition. Leaf decomposition and the characteristics and activity of the microbial community were investigated over the course of 1\xc2\xa0year; these parameters depended on the composition and availability of leaves in the stream. We assessed the biomass, activity, and community structure of the fungi associated with the decomposing leaf mixtures monthly in a tropical stream with little seasonal variation in water characteristics. The leaf material included 27 riparian species; the amount of leaves of each contributing species varied from month to month, with higher overall values in the rainy season. Leaf decomposition was slow, and leaf mass loss did not occur monthly; however, leaf mass loss was significantly lower in May and September. The values of ATP, the ergosterol concentration, and the sporulation of aquatic hyphomycetes varied during the experiment, and only the ergosterol concentration (fungal biomass) was correlated with leaf mass loss. The sporulation rates of aquatic hyphomycetes peaked at the beginning of the rainy season (October), when only three hyphomycete species were present out of the total of seven that were found during the year. In this tropical stream, where the physical and chemical characteristics of the stream water varied little during the year, we hypothesize that changes related to leaf chemical composition could be the cause of changes in decomposition and the abundance and composition of the fungal assemblages. No significant differences were found for the parameters analyzed (lignin, cellulose, fiber, phosphorous, and polyphenols).'

Abstract: 'Despite their symbiotic relationship with trees and the vital role as decomposer in forest, soil fungi received limited attention regarding their changes with altitude in forest ecosystems. This study aimed to determine the diversity patterns of soil fungi along an altitudinal gradient on Mt. Shegyla, a typical forest ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau.'

Abstract: 'During World War II some professional botanists and graduate students who were drafted, enlisted, or commissioned in the armed forces were fortunate to be able to use their training directly or indirectly. This was especially true for the Pacific theatre. Others served their country as civilians. The roles of botanists in the military ranged from teaching or research to participation in combat or support operations. A few botanists in uniform, in spite of their occupational obligations, were able to collect botanical specimens and were encouraged to do so by civilian museum personnel. The best known projects for botanists as civilians involved the search for native supplies of strategic raw materials, particularlyCinchona andHevea, whileCryptostegia and Guayule, as possible sources of latex, were grown on plantations and studied in detail.'

Abstract: 'Up to 80\xc2\xa0% of global commodity production comes from smallholdings of less than 0.5\xc2\xa0ha. Yet commodity crops may be a substantial proportion of a country\xe2\x80\x99s exports, and feed into global supply networks. Pest risks thus have consequences at local, national and global levels. We consider three categories of risk in global commodity networks: introduction of pests to new areas, upsurges of established pests and the risks arising from management efforts. In each category we provide case studies and examples, and consider policy options. Increased travel, trade and transport increase the risks of introduction. Commodity specific biosecurity plans are required for preventing introductions, including analysis of the specific risks (pest pathways) and preparation of emergency responses. Regional and international cooperation is essential. Upsurges can be caused by crop management, evolution of new strains, and environment change. National systems must be responsive to detect problems and address them quickly. Capacity building for surveillance and diagnostics, and the development and dissemination of integrated pest management methods are needed. Investment in research and extension for the agricultural sector is vital. Risks linked with management efforts, specifically, the risk from agrochemicals are considered. Concerns in developed countries over food safety and environmental damage can place constraints on pest management. Failure to comply leads to loss of markets and buyer confidence. Policies that favour lower-risk pest management methods are needed, but are often lacking.'

Abstract: 'The development of new cost-effective bioprocesses for the production of cellulolytic enzymes is needed in order to ensure that the conversion of biomass becomes economically viable. The aim of this study was to determine whether a novel sequential solid-state and submerged fermentation method (SF) could be validated for different strains of the Trichoderma genus. Cultivation of the Trichoderma reesei Rut-C30 reference strain under SF using sugarcane bagasse as substrate was shown to be favorable for endoglucanase (EGase) production, resulting in up to 4.2-fold improvement compared with conventional submerged fermentation. Characterization of the enzymes in terms of the optimum pH and temperature for EGase activity and comparison of the hydrolysis profiles obtained using a synthetic substrate did not reveal any qualitative differences among the different cultivation conditions investigated. However, the thermostability of the EGase was influenced by the type of carbon source and cultivation system. All three strains of Trichoderma tested (T. reesei Rut-C30, Trichoderma harzianum, and Trichoderma sp INPA 666) achieved higher enzymatic productivity when cultivated under SF, hence validating the proposed SF method for use with different Trichoderma strains. The results suggest that this bioprocess configuration is a very promising development for the cellulosic biofuels industry.'

Abstract: 'In the forest zone of Cameroon, small-scale family farmers practicing traditional slash and burn practices achieve a clear field by piled burning of the branches and trunks of cleared vegetation. Plant growth inhibition on ash patches, and the risk of nutrient loss from these areas, was evaluated on field plots on which 0.5 t m\xe2\x88\x922 or 1.0 t m\xe2\x88\x922 of wood was piled and burnt, and in laboratory studies. The ash produced by burning was strongly alkaline, and laboratory bio-assessment studies showed that the saline, high pH conditions produced in ash patches prevented germination and plant growth for up to two wet seasons, as is observed in the field. Field and laboratory studies demonstrated rapid release (1 wet season) of K and S from the ash and the loss of a substantial portion of these nutrients from the soil profile by leaching. In contrast, leaching carries Mg from the ash gradually (3 to 4 wet seasons), while Ca, Cu, Zn and P are leached slowly. The nutrients contained in ash patches are considered at risk of loss both through leaching (K and S) and by erosion of ash (Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn and P). Farmers should be encouraged to spread ash patches prior to cultivation in order to exploit the nutrient content of ash and to lessen the risk of nutrient loss.'

Abstract: 'The Yasun\xc3\xad-ITT Initiative was an innovative development proposal based on the non-production of oil in Yasun\xc3\xad National Park in Ecuador, in exchange for international compensation, eitherin the form of direct payment or payment for environmental services. My aim is to investigate how the different actors understand this compensation for non-production of oil in Ecuador, an oil dependent country. Using a chronological review of the Initiative and forty in-depth interviews with key players, I critically engage the \xe2\x80\x98environmental narrative\xe2\x80\x99 around the Initiative inspired by sumak kawsay -a philosophy of life based on non-mercantilist values, known as \xe2\x80\x9cwell living\xe2\x80\x9d in English or \xe2\x80\x9cbuen vivir\xe2\x80\x9d in Spanish- and degrowth. In this article I argue that understanding the Initiative as an environmental matter and not as a problem of oil rent dependency exemplifies the limits of sumak kawsay and degrowth as proposals for an alternative to development. Results from Yasun\xc3\xad show that the Initiative ended up reproducing the fictions of nature valuation instead of de-linking nature from the valuation process. By drawing on a critical political economic framework, this paper shows that categories such as \xe2\x80\x9cdependency\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crent\xe2\x80\x9d are fundamental in understanding the challenges of moving away from extraction-based development in developing countries. In summary, failing to differentiate between payment for the non-production of oil and compensation from the environmental services, Yasun\xc3\xad was a \xc2\xb4lost \xe2\x80\x98opportunity for a bottom-up debate on what to produce and what not.'

Abstract: 'Numerous ant taxa naturally inhabit stems of live and dead Guadua bamboo (Bambusoidea, Poaceae) in western Amazonia. In an experiment at the onset of the wet season in Peru\xe2\x80\x99s Manu National Park, we augmented potential nest sites in stems of live bamboo, dead bamboo and dead ca\xc3\xb1a brava (Gynerium sagittatum, another woody grass) at five stations within each of ten bamboo patches and ten control areas outside those patches. Each experimental stem possessed three vacant and available internodes, pre-drilled with, respectively, large, small and linear holes, mimicking the range of forms of surveyed natural entrances. After 24 days, approximately 13% of 798 available internodes had been colonized, the majority by fragments of existing colonies. Ignoring entrance type, which did not affect colonization for any species or species group, and censoring non-independent internodes of the same stem, we used individual stems as independent sample units in other tests. One specialist in live bamboo (Camponotus longipilis), and a likely specialist in dead bamboo (Camponotus depressus), were identified based on overrepresentation in bamboo habitat and disproportionate occurrence in live or dead bamboo stems. A third species, Camponotus (Pseudocolobopsis sp.) was more abundant in bamboo areas but colonized both dead bamboo and dead ca\xc3\xb1a. Relatively high abundance of standing dead stems in Guadua forests may account for the presence of a dead stem specialist. The experiment missed detecting specialization in one live culm specialist (Camponotus mirabilis), likely due to its failure to simulate conditions required for the species\xe2\x80\x99 unique modes of colony establishment and spread into new culms. Most opportunistic stem nesters colonized dead bamboo at significantly greater rates than dead ca\xc3\xb1a, but were either equally well represented in bamboo and control areas, or underrepresented in bamboo habitat. Given low colonization rates overall, underrepresentation in bamboo cannot be attributed to competition from bamboo specialists for nesting space. Rather, it may be due to combined effects of seasonal flooding of bamboo habitat, and greater importance of food limitation, relative to nest site limitation, in that habitat.'

Abstract: 'Terms used to describe a region often reflect and directly influence the way space, identity, and history are conceived or constructed. The Caribbean is one such place where external definitions frequently transcend simple geography and socio-political boundaries. The region can be understood by both temporal and cultural categories. The case is made in this paper that archaeological interpretations of social history are impacted by how one conceives of the region.'

Abstract: 'We examine the classical problem of the existence of a threshold size for a patch to allow for survival of a given population in the case where the patch is not completely isolated. The surrounding habitat matrix is characterized by a non-zero carrying capacity. We show that a critical patch size cannot be strictly defined in this case. We also obtain the saturation density in such a patch as a function of the size of the patch and the relative carrying capacity of the outer region. We argue that this relative carrying capacity is a measure of the isolation of the patch. Our results are then compared with conclusions drawn from observations of the population dynamics of understorey birds in fragments of the Amazonian forest and shown to qualitatively agree with them, offering an explanation for the importance of dispersal and isolation in these observations. Finally, we show that a generalized critical patch size can be introduced resorting to threshold densities for the observation of a given species.'

Abstract: 'Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is a tropical perennial crop which is of great economic importance to the confectionary industry and to the economies of many countries of the humid tropics where it is grown. Some recent studies have suggested that climate change could severely impact cacao production in West Africa. It is essential to incorporate our understanding of the physiology and genetic variation within cacao germplasm when discussing the implications of climate change on cacao productivity and developing strategies for climate resilience in cacao production. Here, we review the current research on the physiological responses of cacao to various climate factors. Our main findings are as follows: (1) water limitation causes significant yield reduction in cacao, but genotypic variation in sensitivity is evident; (2) in the field, cacao experiences higher temperatures than is often reported in the literature; (3) the complexity of the cacao/shade tree interaction can lead to contradictory results; (4) elevated CO2 may alleviate some negative effects of climate change; (5) implementation of mitigation strategies can help reduce environmental stress; and (6) significant gaps in the research need addressing to accelerate the development of climate resilience. Harnessing the significant genetic variation apparent within cacao germplasm is essential to develop modern varieties capable of high yields in non-optimal conditions. Mitigation strategies will also be essential, but to use shading to best effect shade tree selection is crucial to avoid resource competition. Cacao is often described as being sensitive to climate change, but genetic variation, adaptive responses, appropriate mitigation strategies and interactive climate effects should all be considered when predicting the future of cacao production. Incorporating these physiological responses to various environmental conditions and developing a deeper understanding of the processes underlying these responses will help to accelerate the development of a more resource use efficient tree ensuring sustainable production into the future.'

Abstract: 'The development of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers provides the opportunity to improve many areas of plant breeding and population genetics. Unfortunately, for species such as the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), the use of next-generation sequencing for genomic SNP discovery is very difficult because of the large genome size and the abundance of repeated sequences. Access to a set of validated SNP markers is a significant advantage for rubber researchers who wish to apply SNPs in scientific research. Here, we performed genomic sequencing of H. brasiliensis and generated 10,993,648 short reads, which were assembled into 10,071 contigs (N50\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa03078) by a de novo assembly strategy. A total of 2446 contigs presented no hits in the current H. brasiliensis genome assembly and may therefore be considered novel genomic sequences of rubber tree. A total of 143 putative polymorphic positions were selected, gene annotations were available for 58.7\xc2\xa0% of the markers, and all of the sequences could be anchored to the released H. brasiliensis genome. These SNPs were validated in eight genotypes of H. brasiliensis and 15 F1 plants from a mapping population, resulting in 30 (20.9\xc2\xa0%) positions correctly classified. The analysis revealed key candidate genes responsible for defence mechanisms and provided markers for further genetic improvement of Hevea in breeding programmes.'

Abstract: 'Many species of insects (probably 1000 or more) have served as traditional foods among indigenous peoples, especially in warmer climes, and the insects have played an important role in the history of human nutrition. As part of the hunter-gatherer style of life, the main criteria for selection of these traditional species appears to be medium-to-large size and easy availability, i.e., abundance, as noted by Dufour and others. Thus it is not surprising that many insects considered as crop pests in modern agriculture have served as important food sources. Locusts and grasshoppers, which often occur in swarms, are good examples, and these insects have been included in the diets of almost every culture with any history of food-insect use.'

Abstract: 'Mangroves are distributed among tropical and subtropical coastlines of all oceans, and associated macroflora and macrofauna are generally well studied. However, information on mangrove-associated microbiota is still scarce. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted research on the occurrence of Myxomycetes in the southern coast of Pernambuco state, northeastern Brazil. In the Rio Formoso estuary, we examined adult Rhizophora mangle (Rm), Laguncularia racemosa (Lr) and Avicennia nitida (An), collecting samples of live trunk bark (Bk), twigs from aerial litter (Tg), and aerial leaf litter (Lf) for moist chamber culture (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89600).'

Abstract: "Foragers of a stingless bee, Melipona seminigra, are able to use the optic flow experienced en route to estimate flight distance. After training the bees to collect food inside a flight tunnel with black-and-white stripes covering the side walls and the floor, their search behavior was observed in tunnels lacking a reward. Like honeybees, the bees accurately estimated the distance to the previously offered food source as seen from the sections of the tunnel where they turned around in search of the food. Changing the visual flow by decreasing the width of the flight tunnel resulted in the underestimation of the distance flown. The removal of image motion cues either in the ventral or lateral field of view reduced the bees' ability to gauge distances. When the feeder inside the tunnel was displaced together with the bees feeding on it while preventing the bee from seeing any image motion during the displacement the bees experienced different distances on their way to the food source and during their return to the nest. In the subsequent test the bees searched for the food predominantly at the distance associated with their return flight."

Abstract: 'All rubber tree clones (Hevea brasiliensis) exhibit regular annual wintering characterized by senescence and abscission of leaves. After 3\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0weeks, this is followed by the onset of new leaves. It is likely that the timing of leaf onset affects the susceptibility of rubber trees to rubber powdery mildew disease, as this predominantly infests young leaves. However, little information is available on the phenological behavior of different rubber clones, or how meteorological factors affect such behavior. We assessed the wintering and flowering patterns of five rubber clones in Xishuangbanna, southwest China, based on observations made from 1978 to 2011, and evaluated how these patterns responded to different meteorological factors. Partial least squares regression was used to analyze the timing of defoliation, refoliation, and flowering. Our results showed that the two clones RRIM 600 and GT1 defoliated during the last week of December and refoliated in the last week of January, and clones Yunyan 277-5, Yunyan 34-4, and PR 107 defoliated during the first week of January and refoliated in the second week of February. The number of hours of sunshine during both the rainy season and the cold dry period in the dry season were important determinants of phenological changes in the rubber trees. Similarly, higher temperatures tended to delay the onset of defoliation and refoliation, and were a triggering factor for the onset of flowering. These results may help rubber cultivators to schedule appropriate disease control measures, as well as to design hybridization programs aiming at the production of clones which are resistant to foliar disease.'

Abstract: 'In Brazil, after the cycle of latex extraction, rubber plantations are reformulated and the wood of these plantings are traditionally used as a cheap source for energy purposes. Rubberwood has other uses based on the consolidated experience in Asian countries. The aim of this article was to evaluate the technological potential of the wood of two main commercial clones of Hevea brasiliensis in Brazil, RRIM600 and GT1, after the period of latex extraction. To accomplish this objective, some physical and mechanical properties of wood were analyzed. The clones had a basic density greater than 0.540\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x88\x923, low volumetric shrinkage (<10\xc2\xa0%), and medium to high strength in compression parallel to grain (>40\xc2\xa0MPa). According to the results obtained, rubberwood has applications in small and secondary structures, lightweight construction, and furniture industry and it can be an alternative in the Brazilian market to reduce the timber demand from native forest species.'

Abstract: ' Objective We seek to comprehensively assess stillbirths in Brazil, to compare the Brazilian findings with global trends and to identify the limitations of the fetal death record system. Method We studied fetal deaths in Brazil between 1996 and 2012 within the following five regions of the country: the North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Central-West, through an analysis of data obtained from the Unified Health System\xe2\x80\x99s (SUS) Informatics Department. The rates of stillbirth in Brazil and in these regions were calculated in relation to the maternal and gestational age and education, birth weight, type of pregnancy, delivery type, weight ranges and cause of death. Results There were 579,661 recorded fetal deaths and a decrease of 22.9\xc2\xa0% in the stillbirth rate. In 2012, the overall rate was 10.0/1000 births; the North and Northeast regions had the highest rates (10.3 and 12.1, respectively) and the South region had the lowest rate (7.7/1000 births). Two-thirds of the deaths occurred in pregnancies of 28 or more weeks. Low education was an important risk factor, with rates of 24.3/1000 birth in women with no formal education and 4.7/1000 birth in women with 12 or more years of study in 2012. More than 40\xc2\xa0% of the causes of deaths were nonspecific. Conclusions Despite the gradual decline in stillbirth rates, Brazil still has stillbirth rates that are nearly two times higher than those found in developed countries. There are inequalities between country regions portrayed by the significant variation in mortality rates specified by cause.'

Abstract: 'Freshwater shallow lakes typically exhibit two alternative stable states under certain nutrient loadings: macrophyte-dominated and phytoplankton-dominated water regimes. An ecosystem regime shift from macrophytes to phytoplankton blooming typically reduces the number of species of invertebrates and fishes and results in the homogenization of communities in freshwater lakes. We investigated how microbial biodiversity has responded to a shift of the ecosystem regime in Dianchi Lake, which was previously fully covered with submerged macrophytes but currently harbors both ecological states. We observed marked divergence in the diversity and community composition of bacterioplankton between the two regimes. Although species richness, estimated as the number of operational taxonomic units and phylogenetic diversity (PD), was higher in the phytoplankton dominated ecosystem after this shift, the dissimilarity of bacterioplankton community across space decreased. This decrease in beta diversity was accompanied by loss of planktonic bacteria unique to the macrophyte-dominated ecosystem. Mantel tests between bacterioplankton community distances and Euclidian distance of environmental parameters indicated that this reduced bacterial community differentiation primarily reflected the loss of environmental niches, particularly in the macrophyte regime. The loss of this small-scale heterogeneity in bacterial communities should be considered when assessing long-term biodiversity changes in response to ecosystem regime conversions in freshwater lakes.'

Abstract: 'A synopsis of the tribe Hureae is presented with nomenclatural updates, a discussion of diagnostic features, and summaries of geographical distributions. This study is based on the analysis of approximately 300 voucher specimens, including collections and photographs of types, in addition to bibliographic documentation. Seventeen species distributed in three genera were recognized: Algernonia (11 species), Hura (2), and Ophthalmoblapton (4). All species are American with the majority distributed within the Atlantic Forest, particularly in southeastern Brazil. A key for the identification of genera and species is provided along with illustrations, information on the geographic distributions and conservation status. Lectotypification for Algernonia leandrii is proposed.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82Late Quaternary humidity changes resulted in substantial modifications of the land surface characteristics in the Altiplano of the Atacama Desert, central Andes. Reconstructions of surface albedo, top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo, and short-wave net radiation in the Andes of northern Chile for 20, 14, 10, 7 and 0\xe2\x80\x84ka suggest that surface and TOA albedo increased substantially during periods of relatively humid environmental conditions (i.e., with large palaeolakes, glaciers and dense vegetation). The decrease of summer shortwave net radiation and seasonality during the late-glacial/early Holocene humid phase (14 to 10\xe2\x80\x84ka) due to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface and atmospheric characteristics added to the effect of orbitally driven negative deviations of Southern Hemisphere austral summer insolation and minimum seasonality at 20\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0S. Therefore, in situ radiative forcing is, in contrast to the Northern Hemisphere tropics, not a suitable explanation for enhanced convective precipitation and, ultimately, humid climatic conditions. Our results suggest that late Quaternary humidity changes on the Altiplano reflect a collective response to (1) environmental changes in the source area of the moisture (e.g., re-expansion of the rain forest and increased release of latent heat over Amazonia and the Chaco, warm sea surface temperatures in the E Pacific) and, (2) large-scale circulation patterns and wave structures in the upper troposphere (strength and position of the Bolivian High, divergent flow stimulating convection over the Altiplano), or that they even reflect a response to (3) interhemispherical teleconnections.'

Abstract: 'Long before the applications of Science and Technology for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development became a recognized field of human endeavour, there have been attempts by individuals and institutions who had the commitment and wisdom to begin the effort. The authors have chosen historical incidents tracing the rudiments of the work of Emperor Ashoka, to the Bishnois of Rajasthan, John Muir, a Scottish-born American in USA, Richard St. Barbe Baker and Wangari Maathai in Africa. People such as Chico Mendes lost their life in preventing the destruction of great Amazonian forest and N. I. Vavilov, a Russian geneticist who foresaw the value of collecting large samples of seeds of cultivated plants in seed banks, much against the then prevalent communist doctrine, not believing in the importance of inheritance. The Chipko movement in Garhwal Himalaya started by Gaura devi and other womenfolk supported by Chandi Prasad Bhat and Sunderlal Bahuguna has been briefly traced. References are also made to the work of Jim Corbett and Salim Ali for the conservation of tigers and birds respectively and recounting the enormous movement to save Silent Valley representing tropical evergreen forest in Kerala from being utilized for generating a very small amount of power. The decision taken by Government of India to refuse Vedanta Resources from utilizing the Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa for bauxite mining which is considered as an abode of their Niyamraja, worshipped by the Dongaria Kondh tribe consisting of 8,000 people has been hailed by the Indian people as just. Finally attention is drawn to Prof. A. Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to develop a Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute in Kerala for collection, conservation and sustainable utilization of 800 medicinal plants, orchids, bamboos and other useful tropical plants. A brief note on the intense efforts made by K. S. Manilal in bringing out English and Malayalam Editions of Hortus Malabaricus compiled by Van Rheede in 12 volumes in old Latin between 1678 and 1693 and in publishing the Flora of Silent Valley has been included.'

Abstract: 'Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were isolated from Munguba (Pseudobombax munguba) fibers and then functionalized with octadecyl isocyanate. Nanocomposites based on poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) were prepared with different concentrations of cellulose nanocrystals (3, 5 and 7\xc2\xa0wt%). We show that the addition of functionalized CNC leads to PBAT-based nanocomposites with enhanced thermal, rheological and mechanical performances, maintaining the biodegradability of the matrix. The better properties of the nanocomposites were related to the optimal amount and the uniform dispersion of CNC in PBAT. The study here presented expands the application of Munguba fibers, exploring their use to prepare PBAT-based biodegradable nanocomposites with improved properties. These nanocomposites have potential for replacement the conventional polymers in future applications with the advantage of exhibiting biodegradability.'

Abstract: 'The Tibetan forest is one of the most important national forest zones in China. Despite the potentially important role that Tibetan forest will play in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s future carbon balance and climate regulation, few allometric equations exist for accurately estimating biomass and carbon budgets of this forest. In the present study, allometric equations, both species-specific and generic, were developed relating component biomass (DW) to diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H) for six most common tree species in Tibetan forest. The 6 species were Abies georgei Orr., Picea spinulosa (Griff.) Henry, Pinus densata Mast., Pinus yunnanensis Franch., Cypresses funebris Endl. and Quercus semecarpifilia Smith.. The results showed that, both DBH-only and DBH2H based species-specific equations showed a significant fit (P<0.05) for all tree species and biomass components. The DBH-only equations explained more than 80% variability of the component biomass and total biomass, adding H as a second independent variable increased the goodness of fit, while incorporating H into the term DBH2H decreased the goodness of fit. However, not all DBH-H combined equations showed a significant fit (P<0.05) for all tree species and biomass components. Hence, the suggested species-specific allometric equations for the six most common tree species are of the form ln(DW) = c + \xce\xb1ln(DBH). The generalized equations of mixed coniferous component biomass against DBH, DBH2H and DBH-H also showed a significant fit (P<0.05) for all biomass components. However, due to significant species effect, the relative errors of the estimates were very high. Hence, generalized equations should only be used when there are too many different tree species, or there is no species-specific model of the same species or similar growth form in adjacent area.'

Abstract: 'We analyzed invertebrate abundance and richness associated with decomposing litter across three riverine wetlands with different inundation regimes located in the alluvial floodplain of the Paran\xc3\xa1 River. Three replicate bags were incubated for different types of leaf litter that were dominant in each wetland for five sampling dates, yielding a total of 165 litterbags. The number of invertebrates per g of remaining leaf litter differed among wetlands and was affected by leaf litter type and incubation date within each wetland. In contrast to abundance, differences in invertebrate composition were more pronounced across wetlands than across leaf litter types within a wetland. Different species dominated in each of the three wetlands. When we compared the number of invertebrates per g remaining of a single litter type (Eichhornia crassipes) across the three wetlands, variability in density was explained by the NH 4 +  content of the water and dissolved oxygen concentration. Many invertebrates associated with litter may not be directly involved in shredding the material, and collectors dominated invertebrate assemblages at study sites. Although both litter quality and wetland condition affect the invertebrates colonizing leaf litter, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity, linked to connectivity, plays an important role in determining invertebrate assemblages.'

Abstract: 'The concept of sustainable forest management (SFM) requires forest resource managers to monitor and collect information pertaining to their environmental, economic and social impact. There are increasing expectations from a variety of publics (government, customers, and other stakeholders) that forests be demonstrably well-managed, creating incentives for forest managers to design credible systems for assessing their management performance. It is against this background that local, national and international approaches to regulating forest practices have been evolving. This article reviews the different dimensions of governance as they relate to monitoring and information reporting in the forest sector. Specifically, it discusses the changing role of sovereignty, the effects of globalization and the emergence of civil society stakeholders in forestry-related decision-making. Concepts such as sovereignty and globalization have important implications for monitoring forest practices and for defining SFM. Whether SFM standard creation and enforcement involves a sovereign, shared-sovereignty or civil society approach will affect the level and nature of SFM monitoring. As a result, we need to better consider the concept of monitoring appropriate to the scale and intensity of operations, how monitoring and information reporting standards differ between jurisdictions, and what this means for independently verifying SFM at an inter-jurisdictional level.'

Abstract: 'We used clearcut logging in establishing four replicated sizes of canopy openings (0.016, 0.08, 0.4, and 2.0\xc2\xa0ha) in a southern Appalachian hardwood forest in 1981 to examine the long-term effects of disturbance size on plant community structure, biomass accumulation, aboveground net primary productivity (NPP), and mode of recovery. The reestablishment of NPP and biomass following logging was 6\xe2\x80\x937-fold greater in large than small openings by 17\xc2\xa0years. Total biomass in the 2.0\xc2\xa0ha openings (127.3\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) recovered 59.5% as NPP (19.7\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921) reached 225% of precut forest levels. Biomass accumulation was 2.6\xe2\x80\x933.6-fold greater in interior than edge locations of all but the 0.016\xc2\xa0ha gaps. The absence of significant patch size or edge vs. interior differences in tree densities suggests that growth rates of individual trees were enhanced in more insolated microenvironments. Sprouting (86\xe2\x80\x9395% of tree NPP) was much more important than advance regeneration (4\xe2\x80\x9310%) or seedling germination (<2%) during early recovery in all opening sizes. Canopy dominant Quercus and Carya trees exhibited limited sprouting following disturbance. Instead, shade-intolerant Robinia pseudoacacia and Liriodendron tulipifera were major sprouters that used N-fixation (Robinia) and rapid growth (Liriodendron) in attaining 7.4 and 5.9 fold greater biomass accumulation, respectively in 2.0\xc2\xa0ha than 0.016\xc2\xa0ha opening sizes. Seedling germination and understory production were extensive in all openings following logging, but declined rapidly as the young tree canopy began closing by 4\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xa0years. The relative importance of shade-intolerant tree biomass approximately doubled over 17\xc2\xa0years as shade-tolerant tree seedlings, herbs, and shrubs gradually regained importance under the emerging canopy. Sprouting caused the persistence of a tree species composition in all openings that remained relatively similar to the precut forest. Large disturbances on mountain slopes of the southern Appalachians generally promote sprouting and rapid recovery, whereas small disturbances in low-elevation cove forests lead to a gradual recovery through seedling germination and/or advance regeneration. Continued logging in the southern Appalachians will increase the relative size and frequency of large disturbances, further the importance of sprouting of shade-intolerant species, and lead to more even-aged forest stands throughout the region.'

Abstract: 'Climate change is predicted to affect the distribution of freshwater taxa, and stronger impacts are expected on endemic species. However, the effects of future climates on freshwater insects from the Neotropical region have been generally overlooked. In this study, the distribution of a damselfly (Cyanallagma bonariense, Odonata, Coenagrionidae) endemic to the subtropical South American grasslands (Pampa) was modelled in relation to future scenarios of high greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 8.5) for 2050 and 2070. For this purpose, ecological niche models were developed based on assumptions of limited dispersal and niche conservatism, and the projected distribution of C. bonariense was contrasted with the location of current protected areas (PAs) in the Pampa. A broad potential distribution of C. bonariense was indicated throughout the Pampa, and projections predicted a predominance of range contractions rather than range shifts in climatically suitable areas for C. bonariense in 2050 and 2070. Projections of suitable areas overlapped in central Argentina and southernmost Uruguay in these periods. Our results indicated a potential resilience of C. bonariense to future climate change, which is likely related to the low restrictions in habitat use of C. bonariense. In every projection, however, most PAs were expected to lose effectiveness, as by 2070 most PAs fall outside the range of the predicted distribution of C. bonariense. Thus, the creation or enlargement of PAs in these areas is recommended and these results represent an important information for the conservation of endemic freshwater insects under global warming scenarios in an overlooked Neotropical landscape.'

Abstract: "This paper argues that the active turbulence and coherent motions near the top of a vegetation canopy are patterned on a plane mixing layer, because of instabilities associated with the characteristic strong inflection in the mean velocity profile. Mixing-layer turbulence, formed around the inflectional mean velocity profile which develops between two coflowing streams of different velocities, differs in several ways from turbulence in a surface layer. Through these differences, the mixing-layer analogy provides an explanation for many of the observed distinctive features of canopy turbulence. These include: (a) ratios between components of the Reynolds stress tensor; (b) the ratio KH/KM of the eddy diffusivities for heat and momentum; (c) the relative roles of ejections and sweeps; (d) the behaviour of the turbulent energy balance, particularly the major role of turbulent transport; and (e) the behaviour of the turbulent length scales of the active coherent motions (the dominant eddies responsible for vertical transfer near the top of the canopy). It is predicted that these length scales are controlled by the shear length scale % MathType!MTEF!2!1!+-% feaafeart1ev1aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLn% hiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr% 4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq-Jc9% vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0-yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr-x% fr-xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaamitamaaBa% aaleaacaWGtbaabeaakiabg2da9iaadwfacaGGOaGaamiAaiaacMca% caGGVaGabmyvayaafaGaaiikaiaadIgacaGGPaaaaa!3FD0!\\[L_S  = U(h)/U'(h)\\] (where h is canopy height, U(z) is mean velocity as a function of height z, and % MathType!MTEF!2!1!+-% feaafeart1ev1aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLn% hiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr% 4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq-Jc9% vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0-yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr-x% fr-xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGabmyvayaafa% Gaeyypa0JaaeizaiaadwfacaGGVaGaaeizaiaadQhaaaa!3C32!\\[U' = {\\rm{d}}U/{\\rm{d}}z\\]).

Abstract: 'How geomagnetic field information is collected and processed by insects for orientation and navigation remains elusive. In social insects, magnetic particles are well accepted as magnetic sensors. Ants have the ability to home and hunt, and some migratory and nomadic species can migrate or move over long distances for which magnetoreception is an important mechanism. It was shown previously that ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectral parameters of one migratory and one nomadic ant could be distinguished from Brazilian Solenopsis ant species and that these parameters correlate to the local geomagnetic field. The present work focuses on genera engaged in long-distance group raids and emigration collected mainly in the Amazon rainforest. A diversity of specimens of the genus was individually measured by FMR. Cluster analysis of the occurrence of the FMR Low Field component, associated with large or aggregated nanoparticles, and their spectral angular dependence resulted in a phylogenetic dendrogram of the genera of ants, principally from the North Brazilian region. The magnetic material characteristics of ants of the Invertebrate Collection from the Museum Paraense Emilio Goeldi were tested looking for their relation to ant genera and the local geomagnetic field. The observed spectral differences of the magnetic particles suggest that they are related to their capacity for adaptation to their environment and/or to displacement behaviour.'

Abstract: 'Governance processes and structures that steer social-ecological systems and in situ forest conservation strategies such as protected areas (PAs) can be crucial for effective management and improvement of the conservation outcomes. Nevertheless, knowledge synthesis on how types of local governance\xc2\xa0and decision-making modes may influence conservation outcomes of forest protected areas is lacking. This is mainly because the evidence on the joint relationships between governance regimes and ecological or social outcomes is generally missing and the knowledge comes from case studies. The research on this topic that use quasi-experimental designs aimed at inferring strong causal relationships is still methodologically in a development phase and the causal effects are hard to isolate. This map describes and maps the available qualitative and quantitative evidence from a large number and variety of sources, both peer-reviewed and grey literature, to answer the following question: What evidence exists on the impact of governance type on the conservation effectiveness of forest protected areas? This across-case systematic map reveals knowledge gaps, methodological limitations of the primary research and generates a list of specific research questions for future research.'

Abstract: 'Lack of adequate knowledge on forest-people interaction is an important reason for the failure of many conservation policies. This study focuses on the behavior of peripheral communities towards non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvesting by estimating the demand functions for NTFP. The paper develops a theoretical model for deriving the shadow price for NTFP using time allocation among different economic activities. Then it tests the competitive time allocation hypothesis between NTFP extraction and tea plantations, the predominant agricultural sector in the vicinity of Sinharaja rain forest. Results provide statistical evidence for the existence of competitive time allocation between tea plantations and NTFP extraction. Own-price elasticities are consistently inelastic, except for one product. As indicated by the inelastic responses, pricing policies may not be very useful in manipulating subsistence NTFP extraction. Repeating similar studies for commercial NTFPs is encouraged.'

Abstract: 'Tropical deforestation provides a significant contribution to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration that may lead to global warming. Forestation and other forest management options to sequester CO2 in the tropical latitudes may fail unless they address local economic, social, environmental, and political needs of people in the developing world. Forest management is discussed in terms of three objectives: carbon sequestration, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation. An integrated forest management strategy of land-use planning is proposed to achieve these objectives and is centered around: preservation of primary forest, intensified use of nontimber resources, agroforestry, and selective use of plantation forestry.'

Abstract: 'Our environmental situation continues to decline faster than ever. This is demonstrated by, the growing spread of pollution of both the water and atmospheric systems, erosion of topsoil, tropical deforestation, desertification, mass extinction of species, depletion of the ozone layer, and climatic dislocations. Compounding the impact of these problems is growth in human numbers in developing countries, together with the associated factor of extensive poverty. The author asks why our environmental situation should continue to decline, despite a remarkable outburst of awareness on the part of the general public and its political leaders since the time of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. The author concludes that the problem does not lie with inadequate effort, rather with misdirected effort: we persist in tackling the symptoms of problems, rather than the problems themselves, let alone the sources of the problems. The paper broaches these issues within a context of fast-growing interdependence among the community of nations \xe2\x80\x94 both economic and ecological interdependence \xe2\x80\x94 which presents yet more problems, but also raises many opportunities for creative action.'

Abstract: 'Resource partitioning of diet and habitat use was studied in the entire Amazonian ungulate community of Northeastern Peru, which comprises the red brocket deer (Mazama americana), grey brocket deer (M. gouazoubira), collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu), white-lipped peccary (T. pecari), and lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Each ungulate species partitioned at least one type of resource from every other species. Digestive morphology had a greater influence on resource partitioning of diet than body size. Neither digestive morphology nor body size were related to segregation of habitats. However, species with similar diets partitioned habitats, whereas species with different diets often used the same type of forest. Increases in habitat breadth of ungulates were positively correlated with increases in dietary breadth.'

Abstract: 'The coupled models of both the Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System (GOALS) and the Atmosphere-Vegetation Interaction Model (GOALS-AVIM) are used to study the main characteristics of interannual variations. The simulated results are also used to investigate some significant interannual variability and correlation analysis of the atmospheric circulation and terrestrial ecosystem. By comparing the simulations of the climate model GOALS-AVIM and GOALS, it is known that the simulated results of the interannual variations of the spatial and temporal distributions of the surface air temperatures and precipitation are generally improved by using AVIM in GOALS-AVIM. The interannual variation displays some distinct characteristics of the geographical distribution. Both the Net Primary Production (NPP) and the Leap Area Index (LAI) have quasi 1\xe2\x80\x932-year cycles. Meanwhile, precipitation and the surface temperatures have 2\xe2\x80\x934-year cycles. Conditions when the spectrum density values of GOALS are less than those of GOALS-AVIM, tell us that the model coupled with AVIM enhances the simulative capability for interannual variability and makes the annual cycle variability more apparent. Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis, the relationship between the ecosystem and the atmospheric circulation in East Asia is explored. The result shows that the strengthening and weakening of the East Asian monsoon, characterized by the geopotential heights at 500 hPa and the wind fields at 850 hPa, correspond to the spatiotemporal pattern of the NPP. The correlation between NPP and the air temperature, precipitation and solar radiation are different in interannual variability because of the variation in vegetation types.'

Abstract: "Incident rainfall is a major source of nutrient input to a forest ecosystem and the consequent throughfall and stemflow contribute to nutrient cycling. These rain-based fluxes were measured over 12 mo in two forest types in Korup National Park, Cameroon, one with low (LEM) and one with high (HEM) ectomycorrhizal abundances of trees. Throughfall was 96.6 and 92.4% of the incident annual rainfall (5370 mm) in LEM and HEM forests respectively; stemflow was correspondingly 1.5 and 2.2%. Architectural analysis showed that ln(funneling ratio) declined linearly with increasing ln(basal area) of trees. Mean annual inputs of N, P, K, Mg and Ca in incident rainfall were 1.50, 1.07, 7.77, 5.25 and 9.27 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921, and total rain-based inputs to the forest floor were 5.0, 3.2, 123.4, 14.4 and 37.7 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 respectively. The value for K is high for tropical forests and that for N is low. Nitrogen showed a significantly lower loading of throughfall and stemflow in HEM than in LEM forest, this being associated in the HEM forest with a greater abundance of epiphytic bryophytes which may absorb more N. Incident rainfall provided c. 35% of the gross input of P to the forest floor (i.e., rain-based plus small litter inputs), a surprisingly high contribution given the sandy P-poor soils. At the start of the wet season leaching of K from the canopy was particularly high. Calcium in the rain was also highest at this time, most likely due to washing off of dry-deposited Harmattan dusts. It is proposed that throughfall has an important 'priming' function in the rapid decomposition of litter and mineralization of P at the start of the wet season. The contribution of P inputted from the atmosphere appears to be significant when compared to the rates of P mineralization from leaf litter."

Abstract: 'The effects of human impact and environmental heterogeneity on the tree species diversity were assessed in 20 fragments of tropical montane seasonal forest in southeastern Brazil. Previous surveys of the tree community, soils and topography of the fragments provided the bulk of the data. The diversity parameters used were the means of species richness, Shannon diversity (H\xe2\x80\xb2), and Pielou evenness (J\xe2\x80\xb2) obtained from \xe2\x80\x9cbootstrap\xe2\x80\x9d sub-samplings of 1,000 trees. Morphometric variables obtained for the fragments included total, edge, and inner areas. Investigation forms were used to survey the history of human interventions and prepare an impacts matrix containing scores assigned to assess the extent, severity and duration of selected impacts. Scores for overall environmental impacts were obtained from the ordination scores produced by a multivariate analysis of the impacts matrix. A multivariate analysis of the standard deviations of soil variables was used to identify the variable which contributed most to soil heterogeneity. The same procedure was repeated for the variables related to topography and ground-water regime. The three species diversity parameters were related to the proportions of edges, the overall impacts scores, and the standard deviations of two selected soil and topographic variables. The species diversity in the fragments increased with increasing heterogeneity of both soil chemical properties and topographic features, and decreased with increasing proportion of forest edges. The evenness component of species diversity also increased with increasing severity of overall environmental impacts. This probably occurred because the 20 fragments did not include highly disturbed forests in the range and the intermediate disturbance effect on species diversity was therefore detected.'

Abstract: "In the core region of Brazilian cocoa production, shade cacao plantations (so-called cabrucas) are important components of regional landscapes, constituting potential habitat for a vast array of the regional biota. This research focuses on the ability of cabrucas to harbor bird and bat species in two nearby districts \xe2\x80\x93 Una and Ilh\xc3\xa9us \xe2\x80\x93 with contrasting landscapes. At Una, cabrucas represent less than 6% of the land and are surrounded by large tracts of forest, whereas at Ilh\xc3\xa9us these shade plantations are the landscape's dominant feature. Bird and bat communities were richer in cabrucas located in Una compared to nearby forest, while cabrucas from the Ilh\xc3\xa9us landscape were significantly poorer in species than nearby forest fragments. However, bird assemblages in cabrucas were characterized by the loss of understory specialists and the increase of more open area and generalist species, whereas forest dwellers still comprised most of the bat species reported in cabrucas. Species richness and composition differed between the two landscapes. Forest fragments and cabrucas from Ilh\xc3\xa9us harbored fewer forest-dwelling species than similar habitats in Una. Our study shows that cabrucas support high species richness of birds and bats from the native assemblages but are no surrogates for intact forests, since the presence and representativeness of some forest species apparently depends on the existence of nearby forests. A landscape dominated by cabrucas with a minor portion of native forest is unlikely to ensure long-term conservation of many target species, particularly those of major conservation concern."

Abstract: 'Termites are among the most important animals in tropical ecosystems where they often make up over 10\xc2\xa0% of the total animal biomass and enhance ecosystem productivity. While termites in general have been the focus of a reasonable amount of work, this effort is not equally distributed among taxonomic groups. The soil-feeding Apicotermitinae, in particular, have received less attention than other taxonomic groups. In terms of species diversity and abundance, the Apicotermitinae dominate African and Neotropical rainforests, where they generally feed on soil organic fractions. Whereas basal Apicotermitinae possess soldiers, this caste is missing in a large cluster of species, collectively called the Anoplotermes-group, which possibly constitutes a monophyletic lineage. These soldierless Apicotermitinae evolved alternative defensive strategies, such as defensive body rupture through autothysis or dehiscence. As species identification in termites is commonly based on characters of soldiers, the Anoplotermes-group has long been neglected by taxonomists, but alternative diagnostic characters, derived from the worker gut topology and enteric valve structures, are now routinely used. Although species identification based solely on worker characters is feasible and new molecular techniques greatly facilitate taxonomic studies, the biology of soldierless Apicotermitinae remains poorly known. The main objective of this paper is to increase the awareness and understanding of this dominant soil arthropod through a comprehensive review of their lifestyle and ecological importance.'

Abstract: 'We developed an assessment and monitoring plan for birds in connection with the exploration and potential development of a large natural gas field in the Lower Urubamba drainage of Peru, a project of Shell Prospecting and Development Peru (SPDP). Our objectives were to: (1) inventory the birds in the area, including information on habitat use and abundance, and (2) devise long-term monitoring protocols for birds. We sampled birds through a combination of visual and auditory surveys and mist-netting at 4 well sites and 3 sites along the Urubamba and Camisea rivers. We recorded 420 speciesduring 135 days of field work. We consider the highest prioritiesfor a future monitoring program to be: (1) establish whether edge effects are occurring at well sites, along roads and alongthe planned pipeline route and determine the significance and extent of these effects and (2) assess the impact of increased human access to the area on game and other exploited species. The remoteness of the area, its rugged terrain and dense vegetation and the lack of trained personnel limit the choice of survey and monitoring methods. We recommend use of mist-netting and transects for monitoring edge effects and useof transects for monitoring game and other exploited species.'

Abstract: 'In a tropical wet montane evergreen forest in the southern peninsular India, the estimated stocking of dead wood is 90 \xc2\xb1 3 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and the total dead wood volume is 70.7 m3\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921. When the logs (downed dead trees more than 10.1 cm in diameter) constitute about 80% of the total deadwood stocking and volume, the rest is by snags (sound and rotting standing dead trees). Since the shola forest trees are characterized by their short stature with low to medium girth, about 89% of the total number of deadwood is of the size ranging from 10.1 cm to 40.0 cm in diameter. The estimated standing dead wood/standing live tree ratio is 0.16 indicating that the forest represents an old stand. Variations observed between logs and snags to change from a given decay class to the higher decay classes in two year period could be attributed to the facts that the logs would be in contact with soil for a relatively longer time and in turn would be in more contact with microorganisms and other decomposing agents.'

Abstract: 'Natural disturbance is a fundamental component of the functioning of tropical rainforests let to natural dynamics, with tree mortality the driving force of forest renewal. With ongoing global (i.e. land-use and climate) changes, tropical forests are currently facing deep and rapid modifications in disturbance regimes that may hamper their recovering capacity so that developing robust predictive model able to predict ecosystem resilience and recovery becomes of primary importance for decision-making: (i) Do regenerating forests recover faster than mature forests given the same level of disturbance? (ii) Is the local topography an important predictor of the post-disturbance forest trajectories? (iii) Is the community functional composition, assessed with community weighted-mean functional traits, a good predictor of carbon stock recovery? (iv) How important is the climate stress (seasonal drought and/or soil water saturation) in shaping the recovery trajectory?'

Abstract: 'In the present study, body length and dispersal ability were examined in carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) sampled in the Peruvian Andes along two altitudinal gradients: old-growth forest and anthropogenically disturbed region. Dispersal ability was estimated by the flight-wing condition (i.e. macropterous or brachypterous) and the cuticular length of the flight muscle (medial length of the metasternum). The relationship between body length and altitude for combined gradients varied by tribe; all possible relationships were found: positive; negative; no relationship. At the family level, a negative relationship between altitude and insect body length was found; this was predicted because of a decrease in the diversity of resources, habitat area and primary productivity, and the increase in the unfavourable environment observed at high altitudes. Flight muscle length was also highly variable among tribes; however, for combined gradients, a negative correlation with altitude was found at the family level. Some tribes were either completely macropterous or brachypterous, but at the family level, the percentage of brachyptery increased with altitude. We suggest two hypotheses that may explain the increased incidence of flightlessness observed with increasing altitude: constraints of energy use and reduced need for dispersal potential. At the family level, carabid beetles tended to have a greater body length and decreased brachyptery in disturbed regions compared with old-growth forests. Increased dispersal ability was expected because of the need to find a suitable habitat in disturbed areas. Observed relationships may depend upon which tribes are examined and whether the forest on an altitudinal gradient has been disturbed.'

Abstract: "The rate of extinction has accelerated to the point where we are probably losing one species per day right now, and we could well lose one million of Earth's 5\xe2\x80\x9310 million species by the year 2000, and a good many more within the early decades of the next century. Plainly we cannot assist all species that face extinction within the foreseeable future. Conservationists have limited resources at their disposal, in the way of finance, scientific skills, and the like. Even were these resources to be increased several times over, we could not hope to save more than a proportion of all species that appear \xe2\x80\x98doomed to disappear\xe2\x80\x99: the processes of habitat disruption are too strongly underway to be halted in short order. But when we allocate funds to safeguard one species, we automatically deny those funds to other species. Already we support only a small fraction of all species under threat, and we may soon find ourselves in a situation where we can assist only a very marginal number of species facing extinction. Thus a key question arises: how are we to allocate our scarce resources in the most efficient way to safeguard species? Indeed we may now have reached a stage where there is merit in determining which species are \xe2\x80\x98most deserving\xe2\x80\x99 of a place on the planet. Agonizing as it will be to make choices along these lines, conservation strategy should be as systematically selective as possible. This means that we should design analytic methodologies to enable us to assign our conservation resources to achieve maximum return in terms of numbers of species protected. In essence, a \xe2\x80\x98triage\xe2\x80\x99 strategy. An expanded approach along these lines postulates a quantum advance in our planning of responses to the growing threatened-species problem: while the techniques of the past have certainly helped the situation, we cannot confront the much greater challenges of the future with an attitude of \xe2\x80\x98the same as before, only more so\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the future will not be a simple extrapolation of the past, but will represent a qualitatively larger set of problems, which require an appropriately scaled-up response in our save-species campaigns."

Abstract: 'The interaction of rain water with the vegetation canopy results in changes of the water quantity and quality. We examined these canopy effects in different ecosystems of the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado. The ecosystems were 20 yr-old Pinus caribaea Morelet plantations (PI), productive (PP) and degraded Brachiaria decumbens Stapf pastures (DP), continuous corn-soybean rotation (CC), and native typical cerrado (CE). We collected rainfall, throughfall, and, in PI and CE, stemflow from three plots of each ecosystem. Dry deposition and canopy leaching were estimated with a Na-tracer method. Between May 1997 and April 1999, the mean annual rainfall was 1656 mm of which 145 mm fell during the dry season (May\xe2\x80\x93September). The throughfall percentage of the rainfall increased in the order, PI (75\xe2\x80\x9385%) < CC (76\xe2\x80\x9389%) < CE (89\xe2\x80\x93100%) < PP (90\xe2\x80\x93100%) < DP (99\xe2\x80\x93100%); stemflow was < 1% of the rainfall. The volume-weighted mean (VWM) pH in rainfall was higher in the dry (6.5) than in the rainy season (5.4). The VWM pH in throughfall decreased in the order, CC (rainy season: 5.9/dry season: 6.2) > PP (5.5/6.0) > CE (5.2/6.0) > DP (5.2/5.6) > PI (4.8/5.7). The rainfall deposition of the dry season contributed one third of the annual element input with rainfall because of higher element concentrations than in the rainy season. The mean Na deposition ratios, i.e. the ratio of throughfall (+ stemflow) to rainfall deposition as a measure for dry deposition, increased in the order, CE (1.5) = CC (1.5) < PP (1.7) < PI (1.9) < (DP 2.1). Total deposition (rainfall + dry deposition) accounted for 104\xe2\x80\x93164% of the K and Ca fertilizer application in PP and for 6.1\xe2\x80\x9312% of the K, Ca, and Mg fertilizer application in CC. The P concentrations were below the detection limit of 0.2 mg L\xe2\x88\x921 in all samples. Net canopy uptake, i.e. a smaller throughfall(+ stemflow) than rainfall + dry deposition, of Ca, K, Mg, S, Cu, and Zn in at least one of CE, PI, DP, and PP indicate that plant growth may be limited in part by these nutrients. During the vegetation period, between 28 and 50% of the applied K and Ca were leached from the canopy in PP and between 8.7 and 17% of the applied K, Ca, Mg, and S in CC. Our results demonstrate that PI causes larger water losses and enhanced acid inputs to the soil compared with all other ecosystems. However, the PI and pasture canopies scavenge more nutrients from the atmosphere than CE and CC.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated the effects of climate seasonality from a thermal and water availability perspective on the activity patterns and resource use of Pecari tajacu and Tayassu pecari during wet and dry seasons in the northeastern Brazilian Pantanal. We used camera traps and temperature sensors to record species activity patterns in relation to temperature, established five habitat categories based on flooding intensity and local vegetation characteristics, assessed the activity patterns of each species in dry and wet periods and in artificial water bodies using circular statistical metrics, and calculated niche amplitude and overlap on three axes (temperature, time, and habitat) in both periods. Peccaries shared a strong resemblance in resource use and in their responses to seasonal variations in the tested gradients. The activity patterns of both species exhibited a significant correlation with air temperature on all the evaluated measures, and both species strongly reduced their activity when the air temperature exceeded 35\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. High temperatures associated with low water availability were most likely responsible for the changes in species activity patterns, which resulted in an increased temporal overlap in habitat use throughout the dry season. However, the peccaries avoided intensively flooded habitats; therefore, the habitat gradient overlap was greater during the wet period. Our results show that an increase in niche overlap on the environmental gradient as a result of climatic seasonality may be partially compensated by a reduction in other niche dimensions. In this case, temporal partitioning appears to be an important, viable mechanism to reduce competition by potentially competing species.'

Abstract: 'Biofuels have lately been indicated as a promising source of cheap and sustainable energy. In this paper we argue that some important ethical and environmental issues have also to be addressed: (1) the conflict between biofuels production and global food security, particularly in developing countries, and (2) the limits of the Human Appropriation of ecosystem services and Net Primary Productivity. We warn that large scale conversion of crops, grasslands, natural and semi-natural ecosystem, (such as the conversion of grasslands to cellulosic ethanol production, or plantation of sugar cane and palm oil), may have detrimental social and ecological consequences. Social effects may concern: (1) food security, especially in developing countries, leading to an increase of the price of staple food, (2) transnational corporations and big landowners establishing larger and larger landholdings in conflict with indigenous areas and the subsistence of small farmers. Ecological effects may concern: (1) competition with grazing wild and domesticated animals (e.g., millions of grazing livestock in USA prairies), (2) an excessive appropriation of Net Primary Production from ecosystems, (3) threatening biodiversity preservation and soil fertility. We claim that is it well known how ecological and social issues are strictly interwoven and that large scale biofuels production, by putting high pressure on both fronts, may trigger dangerous feedbacks, also considering the critical fact that 9\xc2\xa0billion people are expected to inhabit the planet by 2050. There is a need to conduct serious and deep analysis on the environmental and social impact of large scale biofuels production before important energy policies are launched at global level. Biofuels will not represent an energetic panacea and their role in the overall energy consumption will remain marginal in our present highly energivorous society, while their effect on food security and environment preservation may have detrimental results. We should also have the courage to face two key issues: (1) we cannot keep increasing resources consumption at present pace, and have to change our life style accordingly, and (2) we have to deal with population growth; we cannot expect to have 9\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0billions people inhabiting the earth by 2050, without this representing a major impact on its support system.'

Abstract: "\xe2\x80\x82An integrated geochemical and toxicological assessment of environmental mercury contamination and attendant human exposure in Honda Bay, Palawan was undertaken in 1995 following a nationally reported pollution scare centered on a coastal jetty, Sitio Honda Bay, constructed using approximately 1 million tons of tailings and beneficiation waste from a cinnabar mine. Mercury (Hg) data for marine and fluvial sediments, fish tissues and human hair indicate that the toxicological hazard is considerably lower than initially reported by state environment and health officials. Typical Hg concentrations in surficial Honda Bay sediments were found to lie within the global background range (<60\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcg/kg). Downcore profiles provide no evidence of enhanced Hg fluxes coincident with the onset of mining and/or coastal tailings disposal. The mean and median Hg concentrations recorded in tissues of six species of Honda Bay fish are compliant with thresholds established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) for marketable stocks. Earlier reports of 'Minamata range' Hg concentrations in fish and shellfish from Honda Bay remain unsubstantiated. Geochemical analyses of samples of the Sitio Honda Bay substrate have confirmed the prevalence of solid-phase Hg concentrations to ca. 340\xe2\x80\x89mg/kg. The speciation of Hg is, however, dominated by secondary oxides of low bioavailability. The mean Hg concentration in hair from Sitio Honda Bay residents (4.41\xe2\x80\x89mg/kg) was found to be statistically analogous to that for a neighbouring coastal community unimpacted by the coastal disposal of mine waste. A negligible residential exposure factor is thus inferred for the former. Relatively high hair Hg burdens prevail throughout the coastal Honda Bay population, consistent with significant methyl Hg ingestion through daily fish consumption. The data presented provide no environmental or toxicological justification for immediate remedial action."

Abstract: 'In the present study, we describe the temporal and spatial variability in recruitment, growth, and mortality rates of seedlings and saplings of two low-density neotropical tree species, Dipteryx odorata and Copaifera reticulata in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil. As both species have important timber and non-timber uses, for each species we compare regeneration parameters among different management scenarios (sites used for timber logging, non-timber product extraction, and undisturbed forests). Results suggest that both species share similar natural regeneration characteristics. These include temporally and spatially asynchronous germination, existence of individuals that have more abundant and frequent fruit production than the average of the population and a positive influence of the mother tree crown on seedling and sapling density. The management activities analyzed did not influence the regeneration parameters of both species, which suggests that timber logging the way it was performed and current rates of D. odorata seed gathering and C. reticulata tapping at the study site are not sufficiently intense to threaten species population. However, some species characteristics, such as their reproductive strategies, light-demanding syndromes, low-dispersal ranges, and high-mortality rates of seedlings make both species vulnerable to exploitation.'

Abstract: 'The effects of increasing CO2 concentrations on plant and carbon cycle have been extensively investigated; however, the effects of changes in plants on the hydrological cycle are still not fully understood. Increases in CO2 modify the stomatal conductance and water use of plants, which may have a considerable effect on the hydrological cycle. Using the carbon\xe2\x80\x93climate feedback experiments from CMIP5, we estimated the responses of plants and hydrological cycle to rising CO2 concentrations to double of pre-industrial levels without climate change forcing. The mode results show that rising CO2 concentrations had a significant influence on the hydrological cycle by changing the evaporation and transpiration of plants and soils. The increases in the area covered by plant leaves result in the increases in vegetation evaporation. Besides, the physiological effects of stomatal closure were stronger than the opposite effects of changes in plant structure caused by the increases in LAI (leaf area index), which results in the decrease of transpiration. These two processes lead to overall decreases in evaporation, and then contribute to increases in soil moisture and total runoff. In the dry areas, the stronger increase in LAI caused the stronger increases in vegetation evaporation and then lead to the overall decreases in P\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x89E (precipitation minus evaporation) and soil moisture. However, the soil moisture in sub-arid and wet areas would increase, and this may lead to the soil moisture deficit worse in the future in the dry areas. This study highlights the need to consider the different responses of plants and the hydrological cycle to rising CO2 in dry and wet areas in future water resources management, especially in water-limited areas.'

Abstract: 'This paper describes a new, simple, quantitative technique for evaluating the relative usefulness of plants to people. The technique is then compared to the quantitative approaches in ethnobotany that have been developed recently. Our technique is used to calculate the importance of over 600 species of woody plants to non-indigenous mestizo people in Tambopata, Amazonian Peru. Two general classes of hypotheses are formulated and tested statistically, concerning (1) the relative importance of different species, and (2) the importance of different families. The plant families are compared with respect to all uses, and with respect to five broad groups of uses. Palms, Annonaceae, and Lauraceae were found to be the most useful woody plant families. On average, the 20 largest woody plant families are most important to mestizos for subsistence construction materials, followed in descending order by commercial, edible, technological, and medicinal uses.'

Abstract: 'Lynne Cherry Brandwein Lecture March 2010 National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) Conference, Philadelphia, PA. Young Voices on Climate Change: Inspired and Empowered Youth Tackle Climate Science and Find Climate Solutions. As a child, Lynne Cherry was profoundly connected to the natural world and a special place. She watched the destruction of her world. Now, through her Young Voices on Climate Change project, she is trying to give teachers and young people the tools to prevent planetary meltdown on a greater scale. Global climate change is upon us and the need for education and action is immediate. Outreach, visual storytelling, and scientific understanding are especially necessary in light of the recent polls that show that the public is becoming more confused and less concerned about climate change.

Although young people can help their parents, peers and communities understand climate science, they can also show them that reducing CO2 is in their economic interest, and spur them to take action. School carbon reduction initiatives are spilling over into communities yielding measurable results in both global warming gas reductions and significant monetary savings.'

Abstract: 'Significant advances in our understanding of ancient agricultural practices in the Americas have been made in recent years. This review of the literature focuses on studies published between 1987 and early 1994. Issues pertaining to the transition from foraging to farming include the habitability of the American tropics prior to the development of agriculture, theories on plant domestication and the origins of agriculture, regional syntheses of agricultural development, and the origin, evolution, and dissemination of domesticates in the Americas. Other topics reviewed include new techniques that have recently been applied to the study of prehistoric agriculture in the Americas, various approaches to the study of agricultural change, and ways in which research on ancient agricultural practices is being applied in modern experimental agriculture and rural development projects.'

Abstract: 'Tropical homegardens, one of the oldest forms of managed land-use systems, are considered to be an epitome of sustainability. Although these multispecies production systems have fascinated many and provided sustenance to millions, they have received relatively little scientific attention. The objective of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on homegardens with a view to using it as a basis for improving the homegardens as well as similar agroforestry systems. Description and inventory of local systems dominated the \xe2\x80\x98research\xe2\x80\x99 efforts on homegardens during the past 25 or more years. The main attributes that have been identified as contributing to the sustainability of these systems are biophysical advantages such as efficient nutrient cycling offered by multispecies composition, conservation of bio-cultural diversity, product diversification as well as nonmarket values of products and services, and social and cultural values including the opportunity for gender equality in managing the systems. With increasing emphasis on industrial models of agricultural development, fragmentation of land holdings due to demographic pressures, and, to some extent, the neglect \xe2\x80\x93 or, lack of appreciation \xe2\x80\x93 of traditional values, questions have been raised about the future of homegardens, but such concerns seem to be unfounded. Quite to the contrary, it is increasingly being recognized that understanding the scientific principles of these multispecies systems will have much to offer in the development of sustainable agroecosystems. Research on economic valuation of the tangible as well as intangible products and services, principles and mechanisms of resource sharing in mixed plant communities, and realistic valuation and appreciation of hitherto unrecognised benefits such as carbon sequestration will provide a sound basis for formulating appropriate policies for better realization and exploitation of the benefits of homegardens.'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this paper, on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of The New York Botanical Garden, is to provide an overview of NYBG\xe2\x80\x99s graduate studies program along with updated information since the last major review of the program, 25 years ago. Graduate student education has always been, and continues to be, a core mission of The New York Botanical Garden. The program is affiliated six major universities: the City University of New York, Columbia University, New York University, Yale University, Cornell University, and Fordham University. In the 125 year history of the program, the Garden has produced more than 300 graduates, including 216 Ph.D.s and 87 Master\xe2\x80\x99s degrees. Students have focused on floristics, systematics, structural botany, and economic botany; the program has evolved to keep up with the continuous changes in science, with students using the most modern techniques to study plant diversity. Since 1996, the program has produced 93 graduates, including 81 Ph.D.s and 12 Master\xe2\x80\x99s degrees; the Garden\xe2\x80\x99s affiliation with Yale\xe2\x80\x99s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies has produced a dozen graduates; and the Garden\xe2\x80\x99s affiliation with Fordham University, which was reinitiated in 2008, has produced its first graduates. With the growth of the Cullman Program for Molecular Systematics and the Genomics Program in the mid-1990s, student research projects began to incorporate molecular biology (primarily based on DNA sequencing) and to address questions related to genome evolution and evolutionary developmental biology. Technological advances have also changed economic botany research. On the 125th anniversary of NYBG, the hallmark of the graduate studies program is its excellence in teaching and training, with students continuing to integrate data from modern and traditional sources to better understand plant diversity.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the traditional use of medicinal plants in Northern Peru and Southern Ecuador, with special focus on the Departments of Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Cajamarca, and San Martin, and in Loja province, with special focus on the development since the early colonial period. Northern Peru represents the locus of the old Central Andean "Health Axis." The roots of traditional healing practices in this region go as far back as the Cupisnique culture early in the first millennium BC.'

Abstract: ' Hevea brasiliensis is a native species of the Amazon Basin of South America and the primary source of natural rubber worldwide. Due to the occurrence of South American Leaf Blight disease in this area, rubber plantations have been extended to suboptimal regions. Rubber tree breeding is time-consuming and expensive, but molecular markers can serve as a tool for early evaluation, thus reducing time and costs. In this work, we constructed six different cDNA libraries with the aim of developing gene-targeted molecular markers for the rubber tree. A total of 8,263 reads were assembled, generating 5,025 unigenes that were analyzed; 912 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) represented new transcripts, and two sequences were highly up-regulated by cold stress. These unigenes were scanned for microsatellite (SSR) regions and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, 169 novel EST-SSR markers were developed; 138 loci were polymorphic in the rubber tree, and 98\xc2\xa0% presented transferability to six other Hevea species. Locus duplication was observed in H. brasiliensis and other species. Additionally, 43 SNP markers in 13 sequences that showed similarity to proteins involved in stress response, latex biosynthesis and developmental processes were characterized. cDNA libraries are a rich source of SSR and SNP markers and enable the identification of new transcripts. The new markers developed here will be a valuable resource for linkage mapping, QTL identification and other studies in the rubber tree and can also be used to evaluate the genetic variability of other Hevea species, which are valuable assets in rubber tree breeding.'

Abstract: 'Proechimys is the most diverse genus in family Echimyidae, comprising 25 species (two of which are polytypic) and 39 taxa. Despite the numerous forms of this rodent and their abundance in nature, there are many taxonomic problems due to phenotypic similarities within the genus and high intraspecific variation. Extensive karyotypic variation has been noted, however, with diploid numbers (2n) ranging from 14 to 62 chromosomes. Some heteromorphism can be found, and 57 different karyotypes have been described to date.'

Abstract: 'At regional to global scales the only feasible approach to mapping and monitoring forests is through the use of coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery. Significant errors in mapping may arise as such imagery may be dominated by pixels of mixed land cover composition which cannot be accommodated by conventional mapping approaches. This may lead to incorrect assessments of forest extent and thereby processes such as deforestation which may propagate into studies of environmental change. A method to unmix the class composition of image pixels is presented and used to map tropical forest cover in part of the Mato Grosso, Brazil. This method is based on an artificial neural network and has advantages over other techniques used in remote sensing. Fraction images depicting the proportional class coverage in each pixel were produced and shown to correspond closely to the actual land cover. The predicted and actual forest cover were, for instance, strongly correlated (up to r = 0.85, significant at the 99% level of confidence) and the predicted extent of forest over the test site much closer to the actual extent than that derived from a conventional approach to mapping from remotely sensed imagery.'

Abstract: 'Humans have used Caribbean island landscapes for millennia. Theconversion of wild lands to built-up lands or to agricultural lands in thesetropical countries follows predictable patterns. Conversion of moist forestlifezones and fertile flatlands is faster than conversion of wet and rain forestlife zones and low fertility steep lands. In Puerto Rico, these trends areleading to increased built-up areas, environmental surprises, and increaseddependence on external subsidies. Changes over the past 50 yr alsoinclude a reversal in deforestation and increase in forest patch size in spiteof increasing human population density. Present forests have different speciescomposition than the original ones but are indistinguishable in physiognomy andbasic function. The reversal of deforestation and forest fragmentation trends,if accompanied by an understanding of the forces that cause the reversal, canresult in the development of tools for landscape management. Tropical landscapemanagement requires understanding and application of natural resiliencemechanisms of ecosystems, greater use of ecological engineering approaches toinfrastructure development, enforcement of zoning laws, enlightened economicdevelopment policies, and an understanding and agreement of a conservationvision among all sectors of society. Mixing species in new combinations to formnew ecosystems is a necessary step in the development of future landscapes.\xe2\x80\x9cLandscapes have always changed over time, but we sense,somewhat uneasily, that the processes now at work are more powerfully focusedand possibly irreversible.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cOur present assumption is that generally tropical lands aremuch more sensitive and less resilient than those in the temperatezones.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c...the long-term world trend in land uses is a cascadingloss in capacity (i.e., degradation) in every broad category of landuse.\xe2\x80\x9d J.F.

Abstract: 'Estimation of terrestrial biomass depends critically on reliable information about wood specific gravity of forest trees. In recent years, wood specific gravity has become more important when exploring the universality of functional traits of plants and estimating their global carbon stocks. To estimate their specific gravity, wood samples were collected from a total of 34 tree species, 30 from lower elevations and 4 from upper elevations in the Garhwal Himalayas, India. The results show that the average wood specific gravity was 0.631 (ranging between 0.275 \xc2\xb1 0.01 and 0.845 \xc2\xb1 0.03) for the species at lower elevations and 0.727 (ranging between 0.628 \xc2\xb1 0.02 and 0.865 \xc2\xb1 0.02) for the upper elevations. The average wood specific gravity for the upper elevation species was 9.6% greater than that for the species at lower elevations. Aegle marmelos among the lower elevation species and Quercus leucotrichophora among the upper elevation species had the highest wood specific gravity, which were 0.845 \xc2\xb1 0.03 and 0.865 \xc2\xb1 0.02, respectively.'

Abstract: 'Throughout the world, estuaries and coastal waters have experienced degradation. Present proposed remedial measures based on engineering and technological fix are not likely to restore the ecological processes of a healthy, robust estuary and, as such, will not reinstate the full beneficial functions of the estuary ecosystem. The successful management of estuaries and coastal waters requires an ecohydrologybased, basin-wide approach. This necessitates changing present practices by official institutions based on municipalities or counties as an administrative unit, or the narrowly focused approaches of managers of specific activities (e.g., farming and fisheries, water resources, urban and economic developments, wetlands management and nature conservationists). Without this change in thinking and management concept, estuaries and coastal waters will continue to degrade, whatever integrated coastal management plans are implemented. To help in this process of change there is a need to (1) develop a profound understanding of the effects of biota and biotic processes on mediating estuary response to changing hydrology, sediment and nutrient flux and of the biota on hydrology at the river basin scale, and (2) to develop science-based remediation measures at the river basin scale, with elements of ecohydrology and phytotechnology at their core, to strengthen the ability of the biota to sustain and adapt to human-induced stresses.'

Abstract: 'This review encompasses results of fertilization experiments on several agroforestry systems\xe2\x80\x94alley cropping, perennial shade systems, home gardens\xe2\x80\x94in which fertilizer use is a likely management alternative. Fertilizer response was found to be most common in alley cropping, variable in perennial shade systems, and rarely reported in home gardens. Level of nutrient removal in harvested products is probably the overriding factor in determining fertilizer response; greater accumulation of organic residues, slower growth under shade, and longer periods of nutrient uptake probably also contribute to the relatively smaller fertilizer response of the perennial shade systems and home gardens. Considerable knowledge gaps exist regarding the breakdown of organic residues, and interactions between mineral and organic amendments. Systems based on annual crops (e.g., alley cropping) are likely to be less nutrient-efficient and sustainable than systems based on perennial crops, due to reduced fixation and transfer of N to the crops, the tendency of the trees to compete for and sequester nutrients, relatively high P requirements of the crops, and the high labor cost of tree management. The possible benefits of fertilization of specific components in home gardens, and relative advantages of including low-value tree legumes, high-value shade trees, and fertilization in shaded perennial systems are only beginning to receive research attention.'

Abstract: 'Due to assimilation of recycled CO2 from litter decomposition and photosynthetic changes in carbon fractionation at low light levels, the foliage at the base of a forest is often more depleted in13C compared to that exposed to the atmosphere in either the canopy or in open clearings. This is referred to as the canopy effect. African research has indicated that these habitat differences in foliar \xce\xb413C can be substantial enough to affect the carbon isotope ratios of resident fauna. Previous work documenting a 30-year chronology on moose teeth from Isle Royale National Park indicated a progressive depletion in13C and suggested that this could be due to forest regrowth following extensive burning. The present study examined the assumption implicit in this hypothesis that foliar \xce\xb413C varies between open and closed boreal forest sites. I found a marginal canopy effect of 2\xe2\x80\xb0 \xce\xb413C difference between upper canopy and ground flora for a forest in northwestern Ontario and an average difference of 1.2\xe2\x80\xb0 in under- and mid-story vegetation between closed forests and open clear-cuts. Because of these small differences, the utility of carbon isotope analysis in quantifying temporally integrated exploitation of deforested habitats will be low for northern boreal locations. In denser forests, such as those in the tropics or western North American where the canopy effect can be expected to be much greater, \xce\xb413C analysis may still offer some promise for determining selection by wildlife of disturbed habitats.'

Abstract: 'In this paper we review results of research to summarize the state-of-knowledge of the past, present, and potential future roles of tropical forests in the global C cycle. In the pre-industrial period (ca. 1850), the flux from changes in tropical land use amounted to a small C source of about 0.06 Pg yr\xe2\x88\x921. By 1990, the C source had increased to 1.7 \xc2\xb1 0.5 Pg yr\xe2\x88\x921. The C pools in forest vegetation and soils in 1990 was estimated to be 159 Pg and 216 Pg, respectively. No concrete evidence is available for predicting how tropical forest ecosystems are likely to respond to CO2 enrichment and/or climate change. However, C sources from continuing deforestation are likely to overwhelm any change in C fluxes unless land management efforts become more aggressive. Future changes in land use under a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual\xe2\x80\x9d scenario could release 41\xe2\x80\x9377 Pg C over the next 60 yr. Carbon fluxes from losses in tropical forests may be lessened by aggressively pursued agricultural and forestry measures. These measures could reduce the magnitude of the tropical C source by 50 Pg by the year 2050. Policies to mitigate C losses must be multiple and concurrent, including reform of forestry, land tenure, and agricultural policies, forest protection, promotion of on-farm forestry, and establishment of plantations on non-forested lands. Policies should support improved agricultural productivity, especially replacing non-traditional slash-and-burn agriculture with more sustainable and appropriate approaches.'

Abstract: 'Researchers have hypothesized that the degree to which an individual\xe2\x80\x99s actual behavior approximates the culturally valued lifestyle encoded in the dominant cultural model has consequences for physical and mental health. We contribute to this line of research by analyzing data from a longitudinal study composed of five annual surveys (2002\xe2\x80\x932006 inclusive) of 791 adults in one society of foragers-farmers in the Bolivian Amazon, the Tsimane\xe2\x80\x99. We estimate the association between a standard measure of individual achievement of the cultural model and (a) four indicators of psychological well-being (sadness, anger, fear and happiness) and (b) consumption of four potentially addictive substances (alcohol, cigarette, coca leaves and home-brewed beer) as indicators of stress behavior. After controlling for individual fixed effects, we found a negative association between individual achievement of the cultural model and psychological distress and a positive association between individual achievement of the cultural model and psychological well-being. Only the consumption of commercial alcohol bears the expected negative association with cultural consonance in material lifestyle, probably because the other substances analyzed have cultural values attached. Our work contributes to research on psychological health disparities by showing that a locally defined and culturally specific measure of lifestyle success is associated with psychological health.'

Abstract: 'Soil seed banks and current seed inputs each play a role in tropical succession. We compared the abundance and floristic composition of seeds from these two sources at a Costa Rican site by germinating seeds from the soil, measuring seed inputs for 3 yr, and monitoring the earliest colonists in a forest clearing.'

Abstract: 'Ratios of stable nitrogen isotopes in organic matter derived from plants and preserved in soil are potential tracers for nitrogen cycles in natural ecosystems and valuable for evaluation of climate change. However, the relationship between nitrogen isotopic compositions in surface soil and in plant litter during the decomposition process from plant litter to soil organic matter is not well understood. By using nitrogen isotopic analysis of soil particle-sized fractions, nitrogen isotope discrimination between plant litter and surface soil organic matter in various modern ecosystems in northwestern China was conducted. The results of our study indicate that: (1) in general, the nitrogen isotopic compositions of particle-sized fractions from surface soil are different, and \xce\xb415N values increase from plant litter to fine soil organic matter; (2) the \xce\xb415N values in the soil particle-sized fractions become larger with increasing relative humidity and temperature, and the largest variation in the \xce\xb415N values is from \xe2\x88\x925.9\xe2\x80\xb0 to \xe2\x88\x920.3\xe2\x80\xb0; and (3) under a controlled climate, significant nitrogen isotope differences in \xce\xb415N values (\xce\x94\xce\xb415Nplant-soil) between plant litter and bulk soil organic matter were observed, with the values of 1.52 to 4.75 at various sites. Our results suggested that comparisons of \xce\x94\xce\xb415N values between bulk soil and the particle-sized fractions of soil could reveal the effect of humidity on transferring process of nitrogen from plant to soil in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.'

Abstract: "During the 1990s, the Government of Peru began to aggressivelyprivatize agriculture. The government stopped loaning money to farmers' cooperatives and closed the government rice-buying company. The government even rented out most of its researchstations and many senior scientists lost their jobs. As part of this trend, the government eliminated its seed certification agency. Instead, private seed certification committees were set up with USAID funding and technical advise from a US university. The committees were supposed to become self-financing (bycertifying seed grown by small seed producers) and each committee was supposed to encourage the development of a group of small seed-producing firms, clustered around the seedcertification agency. The amazing thing is that many of the seed committees actually accomplished these goals. The agronomists who staffed the committees stood by their jobs,even after US funding ended, even though the committees' income was (at best) modest, and occasionally under the threat of violence from the extreme left. Some seed certificationcommittees failed and others did not. Some of the problems with Peruvian agricultural liberalization can be seen in regard to the seed programs of maize, rice, potatoes, and beans. For example, the government abandoned most research, yet could not resist creating certain distortions in the seed market (e.g.,buying large amounts of seed and distributing them for political ends)."

Abstract: 'The rodent genus Oecomys (Sigmodontinae) comprises ~16 species that inhabit tropical and subtropical forests in Central America and South America. In this study specimens of Oecomys paricola Thomas, 1904 from Bel\xc3\xa9m and Maraj\xc3\xb3 island, northern Brazil, were investigated using cytogenetic, molecular and morphological analyses. Three karyotypes were found, two from Bel\xc3\xa9m (2n = 68, fundamental number (FN) = 72 and 2n = 70, FN = 76) and a third from Maraj\xc3\xb3 island (2n = 70, FN = 72). No molecular or morphological differences were found between the individuals with differing cytotypes from Bel\xc3\xa9m, but differences were evident between the individuals from Bel\xc3\xa9m and Maraj\xc3\xb3 island. Specimens from Bel\xc3\xa9m city region may represent two cryptic species because two different karyotypes are present in the absence of significant differences in morphology and molecular characteristics. The Maraj\xc3\xb3 island and Bel\xc3\xa9m populations may represent distinct species that have been separated for some time, and are in the process of morphological and molecular differentiation as a consequence of reproductive isolation at the geographic and chromosomal levels. Thus, the results suggest that O. paricola may be a complex of species.'

Abstract: 'Flow regimes are fundamental to sustaining ecological characteristics of rivers worldwide, including their associated floodplains. Recent advances in understanding tropical river\xe2\x80\x93floodplain ecosystems suggest that a small set of basic ecological concepts underpins their biophysical characteristics, especially the high levels of productivity, biodiversity and natural resilience. The concepts relate to (1) river-specific flow patterns, (2) processes \xe2\x80\x98fuelled\xe2\x80\x99 by a complex of locally generated carbon and nutrients seasonally mixed with carbon and nutrients from floodplains and catchments, (3) seasonal movements of biota facilitated by flood regimes, (4) food webs and overall productivity sustained by hydrological connectivity, (5) fires in the wet/dry tropical floodplains and riparian zones being major consumers of carbon and a key factor in the subsequent redistribution of nutrients, and (6) river\xe2\x80\x93floodplains having inherent resilience to natural variability but only limited resilience to artificial modifications. Understanding these concepts is particularly timely in anticipating the effects of impending development that may affect tropical river\xe2\x80\x93floodplains at the global scale. Australia, a region encompassing some of the last relatively undisturbed tropical riverine landscapes in the world, provides a valuable case study for understanding the productivity, diversity and resilience of tropical river\xe2\x80\x93floodplain systems. However, significant knowledge gaps remain. Despite substantial recent advances in understanding, present knowledge of these highly complex tropical rivers is insufficient to predict many ecological responses to either human-generated or climate-related changes. The major research challenges identified herein (for example, those related to food web structure, nutrient transfers, productivity, connectivity and resilience), if accomplished in the next decade, will offer substantial insights toward assessing and managing ecological changes associated with human alterations to rivers and their catchments.'

Abstract: 'Management of protected areas must adapt to climate impacts, and prepare for ongoing ecological transformation. Future-Proofing Conservation is a dialogue-based, multi-stakeholder learning process that supports conservation managers to consider the implications of climate change for governance and management. It takes participants through a series of conceptual transitions to identify new management options that are robust to a range of possible biophysical futures, and steps that they can take now to prepare for ecological transformation. We outline the Future-Proofing Conservation process, and demonstrate its application in a pilot programme in Colombia. This process can be applied and adapted to a wide range of climate adaptation contexts, to support practitioners in developing positive ways forward for management and decision-making. By acknowledging scientific uncertainty, considering social values, and rethinking the rules that shape conservation governance, participants can identify new strategies towards \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-oriented conservation\xe2\x80\x9d over the long term.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry often relies on local knowledge, which is gaining recognition in development projects. However, how local knowledge can articulate with external and scientific knowledge is little known. Our study explored the use and integration of local and external knowledge in agroforestry projects in Bolivia. In 42 field visits and 62 interviews with agroforestry farmers, civil society representatives, and policymakers, we found a diverse knowledge base. We examined how local and external knowledge contribute to livelihood assets and tree and crop diversity. Projects based predominantly on external knowledge tended to promote a single combination of tree and crop species and targeted mainly financial capital, whereas projects with a local or mixed knowledge base tended to focus on food security and increased natural capital (e.g., soil restoration) and used a higher diversity of trees and crops than those with an external knowledge base. The integration of different forms of knowledge can enable farmers to better cope with new challenges emerging as a result of climate change, fluctuating market prices for cash crops, and surrounding destructive land use strategies such as uncontrolled fires and aerial fumigation with herbicides. However, many projects still tended to prioritize external knowledge and undervalue local knowledge\xe2\x80\x94a tendency that has long been institutionalized in the formal educational system and in extension services. More dialogue is needed between different forms of knowledge, which can be promoted by strengthening local organizations and their networks, reforming agricultural educational institutions, and working in close interaction with policymakers.'

Abstract: 'Natural hybridization between allopatric species following secondary contact has been poorly documented for Neotropical anurans inhabiting the Amazonian lowlands. We conducted a genetic survey across a contact zone between two species of litter frogs, Allobates hodli and Allobates femoralis (family Dendrobatidae), located on the left riverbank of the upper Madeira River, State of Rond\xc3\xb4nia, Brazil. We obtained tissue samples from 11 sampling sites on both riverbanks, covering approximately a 400\xc2\xa0km long transect. We evaluated the genetic relationships between samples using haplotype networks and a distance-based phylogenetic tree obtained from a dataset of 16S rRNA mtDNA sequences. Estimates of genetic diversity, population structure, and the identification of sites where genetic admixture occurred were carried out by means of frequency-based methods and Bayesian inference on mtDNA and a set of four microsatellite loci, including samples collected throughout the study area. A reduced dataset including only microsatellite loci genotyped from samples on the left riverbank was applied in assignment tests for detecting levels of admixture at the contact zone and adjacent sampling sites, and for detecting and quantifying hybrid individuals. Our results suggest that genetic introgression between A. hodli and A. femoralis is restricted to the core area of the contact zone, where potential hybrids are less frequent than parental genotypes. Effects on the genetic variability of adjacent populations are only detected at sites located 1.5\xc2\xa0km downstream and upstream of the core area, suggesting the existence of selection against hybrids, possibly mediated by postzygotic isolation mechanisms. The contact zone between A. femoralis and A. hodli is the first well delimited suture line between anuran species ever documented in the Brazilian Amazon.

Abstract: 'A number of remotely sensed land cover datasets with spatial resolutions \xe2\xa9\xbd 1 km have recently become available or are in the process of being mapped. The application of these higher resolution and more up-to-date land cover datasets in chemical transport models (CTMs) is expected to improve the simulation of dry deposition and biogenic emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), which affect ozone and other secondary air pollutants. In the present study, we updated the land cover dataset in the nested-grid GEOS-Chem CTM with the 1 km resolution GLC2000 land cover map and examined the resulting changes in the simulation of surface ozone and sulfate over China in July 2007. Through affecting the dry deposition velocities of ozone and its precursors, using GLC2000 in the dry deposition module can decrease the simulated surface ozone by 3% (up to 6 ppb) over China. Simulated surface sulfate shows an increase of 3% in northwestern China and a decrease of 1% in northern China. Applying GLC2000 in the biogenic emissions of the NMVOC module can lead to a 0.5\xe2\x80\x934.5 ppb increase in simulated surface ozone over East China, mainly driven by the larger coverage of broadleaf trees in East China in the GLC2000 dataset. Our study quantifies the large sensitivity to land cover datasets with different spatial resolutions and time periods of simulated secondary air pollutants over China, supporting ongoing research efforts to produce high resolution and dynamically updated land cover datasets over China, as well as for the globe.'

Abstract: 'Knowledge of the relationships and thus the classification of fungi, has developed rapidly with increasingly widespread use of molecular techniques, over the past 10\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0years, and continues to accelerate. Several genera have been found to be polyphyletic, and their generic concepts have subsequently been emended. New names have thus been introduced for species which are phylogenetically distinct from the type species of particular genera. The ending of the separate naming of morphs of the same species in 2011, has also caused changes in fungal generic names. In order to facilitate access to all important changes, it was desirable to compile these in a single document. The present article provides a list of generic names of Ascomycota (approximately 6500 accepted names published to the end of 2016), including those which are lichen-forming. Notes and summaries of the changes since the last edition of \xe2\x80\x98Ainsworth & Bisby\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary of the Fungi\xe2\x80\x99 in 2008 are provided. The notes include the number of accepted species, classification, type species (with location of the type material), culture availability, life-styles, distribution, and selected publications that have appeared since 2008. This work is intended to provide the foundation for updating the ascomycete component of the \xe2\x80\x9cWithout prejudice list of generic names of Fungi\xe2\x80\x9d published in 2013, which will be developed into a list of protected generic names. This will be subjected to the XIXth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen in July 2017 agreeing to a modification in the rules relating to protected lists, and scrutiny by procedures determined by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (NCF). The previously invalidly published generic names Barriopsis, Collophora (as Collophorina), Cryomyces, Dematiopleospora, Heterospora (as Heterosporicola), Lithophila, Palmomyces (as Palmaria) and Saxomyces are validated, as are two previously invalid family names, Bartaliniaceae and Wiesneriomycetaceae. Four species of Lalaria, which were invalidly published are transferred to Taphrina and validated as new combinations. Catenomycopsis Tibell & Constant. is reduced under Chaenothecopsis Vain., while Dichomera Cooke is reduced under Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not. (Art. 59).'

Abstract: 'There is great uncertainty with regard to the future role of the terrestrial biosphere in the global carbon cycle. The uncertainty arises from both an inadequate understanding of current pools and fluxes as well as the potential effects of rising atmospheric concentrations of CO2 on natural ecosystems. Despite these limitations, a number of studies have estimated current and future patterns of terrestrial carbon storage. Future estimates focus on the effects of a climate change associated with a doubled atmospheric concentration of CO2. Available models for examining the dynamics of terrestrial carbon storage and the potential role of forest management and landuse practices on carbon conservation and sequestration are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Synopsis: Since the beginning of serious field studies of nonhuman primates in the early 1930s, many primatologists have been arguing that humans and their simian cousins differ much less than commonly believed. Little systematic attention, however, has focused on the degree to which the foraging economies of human and nonhuman primates are similar or different. Using a comparative method I investigate consumption, organization of production (including technology), distribution, and property relations. Humans and nonhuman primates differ in their division of labor, food distribution, the use of special tools and techniques, and possessing a home base. More importantly, the economic activities of humans, unlike monkeys and apes, are structured through economic institutions, which are mutable.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the diversity of euglossine bees in ten areas of Atlantic Forest Domain in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo State, Brazil. Bees were collected with odor baits for 2\xc2\xa0years, from March 2007 to March 2009. From a standardized effort during the first year of sampling, we compare the four areas using indexes of diversity, evenness, and similarity of euglossine communities. In the second year, we added six new places for presenting a general overview on the Atlantic forest in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo. A total of 2,395 individuals of 23 species were recorded in the study areas. Ilhabela had the highest number of species (19) and individuals (1,260). The most attractive odor bait was eucalyptol, which attracted 16 species and 58\xc2\xa0% of all individuals. Euglossa cordata (Linnaeus 1958) was the most abundant species, representing 50\xc2\xa0% of the individuals sampled; apparently, populations of this species are more abundant at low altitudes, as for example on islands and on the coast. The results also suggest a difference in richness among altitudes, since coastal areas (where the climatic variation are milder) had more species. The present study advances knowledge on the occurrence of euglossine bees in the Atlantic Forest and fills the lack of a systematic study of these bees of coastal areas in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo State.'

Abstract: 'Ecofeminists call attention to the associations that have been made between \xe2\x80\x9cwoman\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnature,\xe2\x80\x9d which can operate as a source of both subjugation and resistance, exploitation, and inspiration. This paper expands upon feminist critiques of \xe2\x80\x9cpurity\xe2\x80\x9d by phrasing these concerns in an ecological feminist perspective. This theoretical exercise of problematizing the ideal of \xe2\x80\x9cpurity\xe2\x80\x9d sheds light upon the intersections of human and nonhuman oppression. Preservationist work has tended to employ the logic of \xe2\x80\x9cpurity\xe2\x80\x9d by focusing on protection of the purity of the \xe2\x80\x9cwild\xe2\x80\x9d regions of the earth from the polluting forces of humanity. However, such approaches retain the troublesome nature/culture dualism. The author illustrates how attempts to fragment and radically separate people from the environment can prove to be highly dangerous. She connects the theoretical resistance to \xe2\x80\x9cpurity\xe2\x80\x9d to the important activist work that is being done to expose environmental racism. Finally, she discusses how \xe2\x80\x9cmuddying the waters\xe2\x80\x9d and resisting the logic of \xe2\x80\x9cpurity\xe2\x80\x9d can offer a promising approach to pressing problems revolving around the intersections of human and nonhuman oppression.'

Abstract: 'Growth defense tradeoff theory predicts that plants in low-resource habitats invest more energy in defense mechanisms against natural enemies than growth, whereas plants in high-resource habitats can afford higher leaf loss rates. A less-studied defense against herbivores involves the synchrony of leaf production, which can be an effective defense strategy if leaf biomass production exceeds the capacity of consumption by insects. The aim of this study was to determine whether leaf synchrony varied across habitats with different available resources and whether insects were able to track young leaf production among tree habitat specialists in a tropical forest of French Guiana. We predicted that high-resource habitats would exhibit more synchrony in leaf production due to the low cost and investment to replace leaf tissue. We also expected closer patterns of leaf synchrony and herbivory within related species, assuming that they shared herbivores. We simultaneously monitored leaf production and herbivory rates of five pairs of tree species, each composed of a specialist of terra firme or white-sand forests within the same lineage. Our prediction was not supported by the strong interaction of habitat and lineage for leaf synchrony within individuals of the same species; although habitat specialists differed in leaf synchrony within four of five lineages, the direction of the effect was variable. All species showed short time lags for the correlation between leaf production and herbivory, suggesting that insects are tightly tracking leaf production, especially for the most synchronous species. Leaf synchrony may provide an important escape defense against herbivores, and its expression appears to be constrained by both evolutionary history and environmental factors.'

Abstract: 'Dengue fever causes mortality and morbidity around the world, specifically in the Tropics and subtropic regions, which has been of major concern to governments and the World Health Organization (WHO). As a consequence, the search for new anti-dengue agents from medicinal plants has assumed more urgency than in the past. Medicinal plants have been used widely to treat a variety of vector ailments such as malaria. The demand for plant-based medicines is growing as they are generally considered to be safer, non-toxic and less harmful than synthetic drugs. This article reviews potential anti-dengue activities from plants distributed around the world. Sixty-nine studies from 1997 to 2012 describe 31 different species from 24 families that are known for their anti-dengue activities. About ten phytochemicals have been isolated from 11 species, among which are compounds with the potential for development of dengue treatment. Crude extracts and essential oils obtained from 31 species showed a broad activity against Flavivirus. Current studies show that natural products represent a rich potential source of new anti-dengue compounds. Further ethnobotanical surveys and laboratory investigations are needed established the potential of identified species in contributing to dengue control.'

Abstract: "Many policy analysts, commentators, and researchers claim that the issue of human population growth no longer receives the attention and concern it once enjoyed in both the popular and specialized media. Other commentators state that scientists and decision-makers are held captive by media-savvy environmentalists who seek to fulfill a political agenda by limiting population expansion. I investigated the change in media coverage of population issues by tallying the number of population-related articles listed during 1967\xe2\x80\x931989 in 3 periodical index services. Media coverage has declined sharply since the early 1970's. Possible causes of the decline are discussed in the context of the larger debate between population \xe2\x80\x9cpessimists\xe2\x80\x9d and population \xe2\x80\x9coptimists.\xe2\x80\x9d"

Abstract: 'Two sites with similar environmental parameters, except for the edaphic factor, were selected in the mountainous tropical forest of southern Mexico. Site 1 was established on an Alisol; site 2, on a Phaeozem. Representative soil profiles were examined on each of the sites, and topsoil was sampled on a regular grid pattern. The soil of site 2 was richer in organic matter and major nutrients and had a less acid reaction than the soil of site 1. The species diversity of the trees at site 2 (30 species) was higher than that at site 1 (17 species). The species compositions of the trees were different on the two soils: there were only six species in common for both sites. The coefficients of species similarity on the sites were low. We concluded that the presence of different soils within the same type of forest ecosystem increases its \xce\xb2-diversity. The examination of edaphic preferences of the species showed that Alstonia longifolia and Thouinidium decandrum preferred rich soils, Inga punctata and Ocotea sinuata preferred poor soils, and Cupania dentata and Hamelia patens did not display preferences in the studied range of soil properties. Thus, the spatial variability of the soil properties affect the spatial pattern of tree species in the studied tropical forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Sustainability rankings are receiving increasing attention by the academic and the policymaking communities because of their potential to influence environmental legislation and reshape competitive landscapes. Unfortunately, most of the indicators used to produce these rankings do not take into account economic development and tend to be biased in favor of richer countries. To circumvent this limitation, we develop a novel, rigorous and simple metric that ranks countries by their potential environmental performance relative to their wealth; in other words, by the degree of sustainability that a country should achieve, given its level of affluence. We apply our approach to measure the sustainability level of 15 developed economies with respect to the share of renewable energy sources in their electricity-generating portfolios. The resulting ranking produces changes in the perceived greenness of certain countries. If adopted, it would allow these countries to increase their bargaining power in international negotiations. It would also alter the pressure faced by their governments to implement or discontinue environmental policies such as feed-in tariffs. Although we applied it at the country level and in the context of renewable energy, the method has far-reaching implications and it can also be used to compare corporate sustainability levels.'

Abstract: 'An endophyte is a fungus or bacterium that lives within a plant in a symbiotic relationship. Extensive colonization of the plant tissue by endophytes creates a barrier effect, where they outcompete and prevent pathogenic organisms from taking hold. This happens by producing secondary metabolites that inhibit the growth of the competitors or pathogens. In this way they play a very important role in the plant defence mechanisms. The metabolites produced by these endophytes fall within a wide range of classes of compounds that include peptides which are the focus of this review. Peptides are increasingly being selected for drug development because they are specific for their targets and have a higher degree of interactions. There have been quite a number of endophytic peptides reported in the recent past indicating that endophytes can be used for the production of peptide based drugs. Molecular screening for NRPS, which shows peptide producing capability, has also shown that endophytes are potential producers of peptides. The presence of NRPS also offers the possibility of genetic modifications which may generate peptides with high pharmacological activities. This review, therefore, aims to show the current status of peptides isolated from endophytic bacteria and fungi in the recent decade. Endophytes as potential sources of peptides according to NRPS studies will also be discussed.'

Abstract: 'Cacao (Theobroma cacao), a perennial crop predominantly cultivated as a multi-product and multi-strata agroforestry system, has been identified as one of an array of factors behind land use changes in the tropics. Concerns have also been raised about the gradual shift from traditional cacao growing systems under diverse and dense tree canopy to lower or no-shade cover, leading to further loss of direct and functional forest ecosystem values such as protective and regulatory environmental services. This paper surveys existing literature and focuses on changes to biodiversity, carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling conditions due to a transition from natural forests to traditional lower-density agroforestry and high-density hybrid monoculture cacao systems. We derive marginal effects on selected ecosystem functions expressed as a percentage unit change in corresponding ecosystem values from a natural forest baseline scenario. Data from 16 studies conducted in Africa and the Americas show a negative trend in marginal changes in above-and below-ground carbon sequestration potential for the two cacao farming systems. The extent of marginal losses in carbon storage was comparatively higher for the monoculture than cacao agroforestry system. A general trend denoting positive marginal changes has been reported for mean species richness in soil and litter and some essential chemical and physical soil properties (Calcium, Magnesium, sand and silt) of cacao agroforestry systems compared with a natural forest baseline. The balance between negative and positive changes show that traditional cacao agroforestry systems have greater potential for conservation of ecosystem services closer to a natural forest state than monocultures.'

Abstract: 'We employ cooperative bargaining theory and Nash\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98rational threats\xe2\x80\x99 idea to cast light on the biodiversity bargaining problem. The problem of global environmental negotiations is argued to be of the nature of a bargaining problem, in which bargainers must agree on the distribution of cooperative surplus in order to move to the bargaining frontier. We discuss the importance of both efficiency (bargaining frontier) and fairness (recognition of characteristics of bargainers) in the choice of the appropriate contract. We show that the incremental cost contract, used to resolve the biodiversity bargaining problem, is of the form of an extreme point contract that fails to recognise the contributions of the South to the production of cooperative surplus. A rational response to such a contract is the use of threats of biodiversity destruction. Contracts must evince both efficiency and fairness in order to represent lasting solutions.'

Abstract: 'Fat extracted from kernels of Shorea spp. (Dipterocarpaceae) in the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra are traded under the name Borneo Illipe. The fat is used in chocolate formulations. The majority of kernels collected are fromShorea species in the sectionPachycarpae. Fat characteristics ofShorea species in this section show differences in fat quality in relation to its use as exotic sources in Cocoa Butter Equivalent (CBE) formulations. In order to comment on the future potential of the naturally occurring tree populations distribution maps of fiveShorea spp. involved in Borneo Illipe utilization are presented.'

Abstract: 'The impact of interannual variability in temperature and precipitation on global terrestrial ecosystems is investigated using a dynamic global vegetation model driven by gridded climate observations for the twentieth century. Contrasting simulations are driven either by repeated mean climatology or raw climate data with interannual variability included. Interannual climate variability reduces net global vegetation cover, particularly over semi-arid regions, and favors the expansion of grass cover at the expense of tree cover, due to differences in growth rates, fire impacts, and interception. The area burnt by global fires is substantially enhanced by interannual precipitation variability. The current position of the central United States\xe2\x80\x99 ecotone, with forests to the east and grasslands to the west, is largely attributed to climate variability. Among woody vegetation, climate variability supports expanded deciduous forest growth and diminished evergreen forest growth, due to difference in bioclimatic limits, leaf longevity, interception rates, and rooting depth. These results offer insight into future ecosystem distributions since climate models generally predict an increase in climate variability and extremes.'

Abstract: 'A regional climate modeling analysis of the Australian monsoon system reveals a substantial modulation of vegetation-rainfall feedbacks by the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), both of which operate at similar sub-seasonal time scales, as evidence that the intensity of land\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere interactions is sensitive to the background atmospheric state. Based on ensemble experiments with imposed modification of northern Australian leaf area index (LAI), the atmospheric responses to LAI anomalies are composited for negative and positive modes of the propagating MJO. In the regional climate model (RCM), northern Australian vegetation feedbacks are characterized by evapotranspiration (ET)-driven rainfall responses, with the moisture feedback mechanism dominating over albedo and roughness feedback mechanisms. During November\xe2\x80\x93April, both Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and RCM data reveal MJO\xe2\x80\x99s pronounced influence on rainfall patterns across northern Australia, tropical Indian Ocean, Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, and Gulf of Carpentaria, with the MJO dominating over vegetation feedbacks in terms of regulating monsoon rainfall variability. Convectively-active MJO phases support an enhancement of positive vegetation feedbacks on monsoon rainfall. While the MJO imposes minimal regulation of ET responses to LAI anomalies, the vegetation feedback-induced responses in precipitable water, cloud water, and rainfall are greatly enhanced during convectively-active MJO phases over northern Australia, which are characterized by intense low-level convergence and efficient precipitable water conversion. The sub-seasonal response of vegetation-rainfall feedback intensity to the MJO is complex, with significant enhancement of rainfall responses to LAI anomalies in February during convectively-active MJO phases compared to minimal modulation by the MJO during prior and subsequent calendar months.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forest land is increasingly influenced by man-caused wildfires. The vast majority of the forested area burnt and cleared annually is in the tropics. The use of fire in rural land-use systems is the major cause of the wildfires. Five broad causative agencies of wildfires are presented, shifting cultivation, grazing, non-wood forest products, migration programs and the wildland/residential interface. Integrated concepts of prescribed burning and prescribed grazing may offer solutions to the tropical wildland fire problems.'

Abstract: 'Altitude is one of the major environmental variables influencing the distribution of tree taxa around the world, and can be a useful parameter for the development of conservation strategies. Our objectives were to obtain an overview of the conservation status of taxa from the Atlantic semideciduous seasonal forests of southeastern Brazil and check, among the floristically consistent altitudinal zones, which had the largest number of endemic, threatened and indicator species. To accomplish this, we used species occurrence and geo-climatic data from the \xe2\x80\x98NeoTropTree\xe2\x80\x99 database. First, we checked which zones were floristically consistent using an ordination method (non-metric multidimensional scaling, NMS) followed by an analysis of variance. Then, we conducted an indicator species analysis, estimated species richness, calculated the taxonomic distinctness index for all zones and evaluated important aspects for conservation, such as endemism and threat of extinction. Taxa richness, and number of endemic and threatened species decreased with increasing altitude, while the amount of indicator species for each zone increased with altitudinal elevation. These variations related to the altitudinal gradient should be considered when developing conservation strategies. We also should prioritise the conservation of the entire gradient and, whenever possible, include endemic and endangered species in forest recovery programs.'

Abstract: 'A 28 yr old secondary lowland rain forest in Costa Rica was dominated by two tree species of contrasting ecologies, Vochysia ferruginea - a species typical of well-drained but infertile soils of high Al saturation, and Cordia alliodora, a species requiring soils of at least moderate fertility. The two species exhibited markedly different spatial distributions in the forest and we sought to determine whether or not these different distributions were related to variation in substrate conditions and the nutrient requirements of the two species. Two soil types were present: Ultisols (Typic Haplohumults) and Inceptisols (Typic Dystropepts) and topography was of low hills. The study formed part of an analysis of site quality for timber production in the two species and therefore used standard forestry methods for such analyses. 36 plots of 20 m\xc3\x9720 m were established using predetermined criteria of site uniformity, presence of at least four dominant trees of at least one of the study species, and absence of disturbance. The abundance (number of individuals \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm dbh) of each species was determined in each plot. Soil samples were taken in 27 of the 36 plots, 9 plots being considered to replicate conditions already sampled, and 14 soil chemical and physical variables were measured using standard methods. Foliar nutrient analyses were carried out for trees of both species with crowns fully exposed to sunlight, distributed across the gradient of soil conditions. Variations in species abundances were not related to soil type, but plots in which Vochysia ferruginea was more abundant tended to be on steeper slopes with soils of higher exchangeable acidity and lower concentrations of Mn; Cordia alliodora was more abundant on gentler topography where soils had much lower exchangeable acidity but higher Mn. Differences between the two species in foliar nutrient concentrations were marked and supported previous interpretations of their nutrient requirements; foliar nutrients of Vochysia ferruginea were typical of tree species of moist tropical forest on infertile soils, and those of Cordia alliodora typical of a species requiring more fertile soils. Factors such as the distributions of seed trees at site abandonment may affect the spatial distributions of tree species in secondary forests such as that studied. The relationships of the distributions of the two species to substrate variation, however, and their evidently different nutrient requirements, support the hypothesis that variation in the composition and structure of the forest studied is at least partially related to exchangeable acidity and its dominant cation, Al.'

Abstract: 'The paper analyzes the concept of sustainable development in the light of the different interpretations existing on the issue since its appearance and establishment as an ideal to lead humanity\xe2\x80\x99s line of progress.

Abstract: 'Rapid growth of biofuel production in the United States and Brazil over the past decade has increased interest in replicating this success in other nations of the Pan American region. However, the continued use of food-based feedstock such as maize is widely seen as unsustainable and is in some cases linked to deforestation and increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising further doubts about long-term sustainability. As a result, many nations are exploring the production and use of cellulosic feedstock, though progress has been extremely slow. In this paper, we will review the North\xe2\x80\x93South axis of biofuel production in the Pan American region and its linkage with the agricultural sectors in five countries. Focus will be given to biofuel policy goals, their results to date, and consideration of sustainability criteria and certification of producers. Policy goals, results, and sustainability will be highlighted for the main biofuel policies that have been enacted at the national level. Geographic focus will be given to the two largest producers\xe2\x80\x94the United States and Brazil; two smaller emerging producers\xe2\x80\x94Argentina and Canada; and one stalled program\xe2\x80\x94Mexico. However, several additional countries in the region are either producing or planning to produce biofuels. We will also review alternative international governance schemes for biofuel sustainability that have been recently developed, and whether the biofuel programs are being managed to achieve improved environmental quality and sustainable development.'

Abstract: 'Gregory Bateson, who is regarded as one of the founders of the field of family therapy, warned about the dangers of chopping up the ecology (literally and metaphorically). Yet the ecosystem is showing signs of faltering under the pressure of human mistreatment, and increasingly people are manifesting symptoms associated with extreme disconnection from nature. Although family therapists have devoted little attention to the relationship between human and ecological planetary suffering, as systemically trained professionals MFTs are uniquely situated to see the big picture and to promote integrative healing between individual, familial, and environmental levels. This article explores some of the factors underpinning the field\xe2\x80\x99s lack of attention to ecological issues and provides recommendations for how MFTs can remember the pattern that connects by cultivating a more eco-informed approach to training and clinical practice.'

Abstract: "Satellite data and the published coefficients about the world's and China's ecosystem were used to analyze the effects of land-use changes on the ecosystem service in the Yanqi Basin. Both economic developments and arid, fragile ecosystems have strongly affected the land use. A sensitivity analysis determined the effect of manipulating the coefficients on the estimated values. Results indicated that (1) the total value of ecosystem services in the Yanqi Basin were 9,374.66, 10,450.52, 9,964.20, and 9,8707.77 million Yuan in 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2011, respectively. The net increase in ecosystem service values were about 496.11 million Yuan within 1990\xe2\x80\x932011; (2) The aggregated ecosystem service values of water body, wetlands, grasslands, and croplands were about 99.25\xc2\xa0% of the total value; (3) Waste treatment and soil formation were the top two ecological functions with high service values and contributing about 61.70\xc2\xa0% of the total service values; and (4) Ecosystem service values estimated in this study were inelastic with respect to the value coefficients; therefore, the estimation was robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients. A reasonable land-use plan should be based on rigorous environmental impact analyses for maintaining stability and sustainable development of the Yanqi Basin."

Abstract: 'Bioluminescence is a common feature of the communication and defence of marine organisms, but this phenomenon is highly restricted in the terrestrial biota. Here, we present a geographical distribution of only the third order of luminescent insects\xe2\x80\x94luminescent cockroaches, with all 13 known and/or herein reported new living species (based on deposited specimens). We show that, for the first time, photo-characteristics of three examined species are nearly identical with those of toxic luminescent click beetles, which they mimic. These observations are the evidence for the mimicry by light\xe2\x80\x94a new type of defensive, Batesian and interordinal mimicry. Our analysis surprisingly reveals an evolutionary novelty of all living luminescent insects, while in the sea (and possibly in the soil) luminescence is present also phylogenetically in very primitive organisms.'

Abstract: 'Morphological and ecophysiological traits showed by male and female Populus tomentosa Carr. trees were studied under various degrees of water and alkaline stresses. The results showed that different adaptations to drought and alkaline stresses were adopted by each gender; males possessed a much higher tolerance to both stresses compared to females. In contrast to females, the males exhibited a lower inhibition in total biomass, total leaf area, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, leaf carbon and nitrogen concentrations as well as water- and nitrogen-use efficiency in response to drought and alkaline stresses. Nevertheless, compared to the males, the females showed a higher plasticity in root biomass/shoot biomass ratio, fine root/coarse root ratio, and intrinsic water-use efficiency, indicating that the males and females differed in some of trade-offs between growth and stress defence to maximize water and nitrogen gains under both stress conditions.'

Abstract: "Today's disturbance of the global carbon cycle induced by anthropogenic processes has raised new interest in the history of the global carbon cycle and its relationship to climate and other geochemical cycles. Carbon-isotope stratigraphy proves to be most useful as a monitor of the history of the carbon-cycle during the last 200 million years. In the introductory paragraphs of this review the mode of functioning of the global carbon-cycle is summarized and the connection between carbon-cycle and carbon isotope geochemistry is documented. A case study on the disturbance of the global carbon cycle during the Aptian-Albian is presented. The disturbance of the carbon cycle lasting up to millions of years is recorded in the carbon-isotope stratigraphy of pelagic sediments. It is superimposed on high frequency sedimentological cycles, related to climate and oceanographic cycles of 20, 40 or 100 ky duration. The data reviewed suggest that the change in the global carbon system was linked to a global acceleration of geochemical cycles triggered by a long-term change in atmospheric CO2 controlled by the rate of sea-floor formation and by volcanic activity. Increased accumulation rates of terrestrial material and terrestrial organic matter in marine sediments may be used as an indicator of an intensified hydrological cycling resulting in higher water-discharge rates. An intensification of the Aptian-Albian water cycle is further reflected in continental sediments monitoring a period of elevated humidity. An increase in water discharge rates should have affected the transfer rate of dissolved nutrients from continents to oceans. Elevated concentrations of phosphorus may have led to an increase in Aptian-Albian oceanic productivity enhancing the transfer of marine organic matter from the oceanic into the sedimentary reservoir. Increased productivity, increased bulk sedimentation rates and poorly oxygenated deep-water led to increased preservation of marine and terrestrial organic matter in marine sediments. The accelerated output of marine organic carbon from the oceanic reservoir is ultimately registered in the positive carbon-isotope excursion of the marine carbonate carbon-isotope stratigraphy."

Abstract: 'Tropical peatlands are known not only for their high, area-based, carbon emissions in response to land-use change but also as hot spots of debate about associated data uncertainties. Perspectives are still evolving on factors underlying the variability and uncertainty. Debate includes the ways of reducing emissions through rewetting, reforestation and agroforestry. A knowledge value-chain that is long and complex links (a) fundamental understanding of peat and peatland processes leading to sciencebased quantification and default values, (b) willingness and (c) ability to act towards emission reduction, and ultimately (d) to local, national and global actions that effectively provide rules, incentives and motivation to conserve peat and reduce emissions. We discuss this value chain, its stakeholders and issues that still remain partially unresolved. We conclude that, to shorten the denial and conspiracy-theory stages of debate that otherwise slow down steps B and C, networks of international and national scientists have to be involved at the early stage of identifying policysensitive environmental issues. Models span part of the knowledge value-chain but transition of analysis units requires specific attention, from soil volumes through area and commodity flows to opportunities for reductions. While drainage of peatlands triggers landscape-scale increases in emissions, factors beyond drainage depth, including nutrient supply, may have a major influence on decomposition rates. Attempts to disentangle the contributions of plant and peat-based respiration in surface flux measurements involve assumptions that cannot be easily verified in comparisons between land uses. With progress on A leading to new internationally accepted defaults and with resistance on step B reduced, the reality of C and lack of working solutions for D is currently constraining further progress.'

Abstract: 'Kibale National Park, Uganda, has a rich and abundant primate community and a complicated history of anthropogenic disturbance. Moreover, it has been the focus of over 30 yr of research and has received considerable attention from nongovernmental and governmental conservation organizations. As a result, Kibale serves as a valuable case study with which to evaluate the factors that regulate primate population density and the challenges of deriving generalizations for conservation. We review the impact of logging and forest fragmentation on primate population density and trace the efficacy of various conservation strategies. A 28-yr comparison of primate abundance in logged and unlogged forests and a 10-yr study of forest dynamics showed that primate recovery in logged areas is generally slow or not occurring at all for some species, which is likely driven by the fact that the forest is not recovering as expected. No primate species characteristic predicted their ability to live in forest fragments around Kibale. While a nutritional model was useful to predict the abundance of colobus in forest fragments outside of Kibale, a 5-yr study revealed that human land-use practices are more fundamentally shaping population dynamics. We evaluate data on primate abundance in light of Milton\xe2\x80\x99s protein/fiber model to predict colobine biomass. We demonstrate that while the model can predict colobus biomass in pristine habitats, the 2 colobus species respond differently to disturbance. We offer suggestions for future conservation research and consider strategies to conserve forested national parks based on experiences gained over 30 yr.'

Abstract: 'A method of using the standard network weather station data for local ecosystem research is considered on the example of the modern climate of the C\xc3\xa1t Ti\xc3\xaan National Park (Southern Vietnam) and local climate change in 1980\xe2\x80\x932010. Special attention is focused on the environmental parameters, which play a role of the limiting factors. It is shown that the climate of Southern Vietnam responds with statistical significance to global climate change. Suggestions about the possible reactions of tropical monsoon forest ecosystem to climate change are given.'

Abstract: 'When a natural group of plants has over many years been comprehensively and intensively studied, a large body of data, analysis and evaluation has accumulated. It is in the nature of such work on the taxonomy of such a group that this information is to be found scattered in various publications, such as research papers, checklists, monographs, Floras and other compilations. As time and research progress, some of this information will become outdated and superseded by new publications, but other information remains current and valuable. To give a review of this can provide us not only with a guide to this resource, but also with an introduction to the group in question. It may stimulate new research, as inevitably we will find that all has not been said and done, even about a group so well studied as the conifers. I hope that this paper will meet these aims.'

Abstract: "Dissection of 1,941 specimens provided data on reproductive cycles in six genera of skinks and three genera of agamids from the Alligator Rivers Region of Australia's Northern Territory. Comparative data on lizards from the temperate zone were gathered by dissecting specimens of three genera, and by reviewing published studies. The Alligator Rivers Region climate exhibits uniformly high temperatures but extremely seasonal rainfall. By analogy with studies on tropical herpetofaunas in other parts of the world, we hypothesised that most species would breed during the wet-season."

Abstract: 'Fine-root density in a mature cacao plantation in Bahia/Brazil was monitored at weekly intervals from October, 1980 until March, 1981. About 40 g m\xe2\x88\x922 of fine roots (diameter<1 mm) were found during this period. The relative stability of this value over the six months period contrasted with significant changes in the number of growing root tips per unit of soil volume. These changes were not conditioned by the rainfall pattern although low root tip values were counted at the end of a minor drought period. A significant negative correlation was found between a shoot growth flush in January and the activity of the fine-root systems as measured by the number of new root tips.'

Abstract: 'Tamarins of the genus Saguinus feed on a wide range of arthropods and small vertebrates, which compose a critical component of their diet. This paper examines the foraging patterns and capture success of the Avila-Peres saddle-back (S. fuscicollis avilapiresi) and the red-capped moustached tamarin (S. mystax pileatus) in very stable mixed-species groups, and whether and how any foraging benefits for either species resulted from their association. Moustached tamarins actively searched for prey items which were mainly well exposed on the midstorey foliage. Saddle-back tamarins, on the other hand, foraged at lower heights, largely by manipulating a variety of microhabitats potentially concealing embedded prey. The foraging activity of the numerically dominant and larger-bodied moustached tamarins often resulted in prey items escaping to lower substrates, usually the forest leaf-litter. The \xe2\x80\x9cbeating effect\xe2\x80\x9d of this species substantially facilitated captures of large, mobile prey items by saddle-backs, which were highly adept at locating and retrieving flushed prey. It is estimated that, while saddle-backs obtained 66\xe2\x80\x9373% of their prey biomass from flushed items, this proportion was substantially lower (2\xe2\x80\x939%) for moustached tamarins. Commensal insectivory appears to involve a highly asymmetric benefit to saddle-backs, and a low cost to moustached tamarins, which partly explains the stability of mixed-species groups.'

Abstract: 'Trees and shrubs of Mexicoby P. C. Standley (1920-1926) gives medicinaluses and poisonous properties for a variety of plants. The literature since 1920 has been reviewed for further properties of the medicinal papilionoid legumes mentioned by Standley, as well as some of their allies, and the results are presented here. It is hoped that this review will not only provide a useful update to Standley\xe2\x80\x99s work, but will also draw attention to certain species which have been little studied since Standley\xe2\x80\x99s time.

Abstract: 'An analysis of the flowering plant flora of a lowland moist forest in central French Guiana reveals 298 species with adaptations for wind dispersal. This represents 16.2% of the flowering plant flora and 9.8% of the class Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons). The most diverse wind-dispersed families are the Orchidaceae in the Liliopsida (monocotyledons) with 135 species and the Bignoniaceae in the Magnoliopsida with 37 species. The wind-dispersed species of central French Guiana have evolved either small, dust-like seeds, fruits or seeds with various kinds of wings, fruits or seeds with tufts of hairs, or expanded wing- or parachute-like persistent calyces. Most wind-dispersed species, among the liliopsids, are epiphytes and, among the magnoliopsids, trees or lianas. In central French Guiana, collections of these species with mature diaspores have been gathered most often in October and March, the months with peak wind velocities. In contrast, collections from June and July, when wind velocities are at a minimum, are rare.'

Abstract: 'Quantifying survey completeness is a key step in designing and interpreting biodiversity assessments. To date this has only been examined either at a local scale through repetitive sampling, or across broader geographic areas through multiple survey sites. In this paper, we determine the completeness of sampling at both local and continental scales, of the phytophagous arthropod assemblage on the Neotropical shrub Parkinsonia aculeata (Leguminosae). We used survey gap analysis (SGA) to determine whether existing surveys adequately sampled the diversity of environments and geographic space covered by the plant. Within defined geographic regions, we determined survey completeness at a local scale with species accumulation curves. SGA identified the highest priority sites for future sampling in the Sonoran Desert and the Pacific Coast of South America. The arthropods sampled on P. aculeata differed significantly between seasons, highlighting the importance of including surveys throughout the year. At the local scale, surveys in most regions were estimated to have sampled <50\xc2\xa0% of all species. Only the Mexican Gulf, following 84 samples including 902 individuals, had a reasonably complete sample of all species (more than 50\xc2\xa0%). As in other studies, rare species will continue to be detected even after extensive surveying, and it is likely that close to 100 samples or 1,000 individuals will be needed to attain 50\xc2\xa0% survey completeness in a region. However, if the objective is to document close \xe2\x80\x9chost-associations\xe2\x80\x9d then effort may be better directed at surveying ecologically distinct new areas rather than exhaustive sampling in existing ones. Methods such as SGA can direct such surveys, and in conjunction with species-richness estimates, can be used to assess the adequacy of existing surveys.'

Abstract: 'Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws? The answer to this question is important since corruption is an important reason why environmental policies are not properly enforced, but previous studies of environmental public opinion do not address the issue. We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.'

Abstract: 'Plants are a valuable source of pharmacologically important compounds since these are traditionally important in medicinal systems. Medicinal plant-based ancient wisdom could serve as a powerful tool to facilitate focused research on natural compounds for the drug discovery process. Medicinal plants are more important sources for drug discovery, specifically lead molecules as these offer several advantages over the synthetic molecules. Since in post genomic era, molecular targets for most diseases are known, conventional bioscreening strategies for medicinal plants are not sufficient to fulfill the present demand. It makes the role of medicinal plants more significant than ever before. The rich heritage of Indian medicinal plants can be explored utilizing various computational approaches for bioprospecting in the post-genomic era. In this review, the authors explore how Indian medicinal plant legacy can be utilized in post-genomic era utilizing the computational, bioinformatics, chemo-informatics, genomics and systems biology approaches. This approach shall make possible the systematic analysis integrating traditional and modern data in order to validate medicinal plant based knowledge.'

Abstract: 'The quality of breeding sites is of great importance for the reproductive success and accordingly the fitness of many animal species. Hence, individuals should decide carefully where to rear their offspring. Often parents have to account for multiple characteristics of habitat quality at once, which in turn might change over time. Specimens confronted with such variability may evolve the ability to display context-dependant decision plasticity. Anuran amphibians breeding in ephemeral pools largely face two risks for their offspring: desiccation and predation. The Neotropical poison frog Ranitomeya variabilis deposits both eggs and tadpoles in phytotelmata. These small tadpole nurseries lower the risk of offspring predation. However, because most poison frog tadpoles are cannibalistic, even these pools need to be surveyed for predators, and parents tend to avoid deposition with conspecifics. We tested if this avoidance behaviour does change in parental R. variabilis depending on seasonal circumstances. Over several months we provided the frogs the option to deposit their eggs or tadpoles in pools that did and did not contain chemical cues of cannibalistic conspecifics, respectively. During the rainy season, frogs strongly avoided conspecific cues for both eggs and tadpoles. Anyway, with the change to the dry season, parental preferences changed such that parent frogs were more likely to deposit tadpoles (but not eggs) in pools containing cues of conspecific tadpoles. We suggest that R. variabilis, a species that typically isolates its cannibalistic offspring, has evolved a plastic feeding behaviour with regard to the risk of phytotelmata desiccation. We interpret that parents provide older tadpoles with younger \xe2\x80\x98trophic\xe2\x80\x99 tadpoles in order to accelerate their development and save them from impending desiccation.'

Abstract: 'Theobroma cacao L. (cacao) is a perennial tropical tree, endemic to rainforests of the Amazon Basin. Large populations of bacteria live on leaf surfaces and these phylloplane microorganisms can have important effects on plant health. In recent years, the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques has greatly facilitated studies of the phylloplane microbiome. In this study, we characterized the bacterial microbiome of the phylloplane of the catongo genotype (susceptible to witch\xe2\x80\x99s broom) and CCN51 (resistant). Bacterial microbiome was determined by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.'

Abstract: 'In tropical dry environments rainfall periodicity may affect demographic parameters, resulting in fluctuations in bird abundance. We used capture\xe2\x80\x93recapture data for the Grey Pileated Finch from a Neotropical dry forest to evaluate the hypothesis that intra- and inter-annual survival, individuals entrance and population abundance, are related to local rainfall. Sampling occurred across 3\xc2\xa0years, with individuals captured, tagged and evaluated for age and presence of brood patch every 14\xc2\xa0days. Using the POPAN formulation, we generated demographic models to evaluate study population temporal dynamics. Best-fit models indicated a low apparent annual survival in the first year (16%) compared to other years (between 47 and 62%), with this low value associated with an extreme drought. The abundance of juveniles at each capture occasion was significantly dependent on the accumulated precipitation in the previous 14\xc2\xa0days, and the juvenile covariate was a strong predictor of the intra-annual entrance probability (natality). Individuals entrance during the reproductive period corresponded to 53, 52 and 75% of total ingress for each year, respectively. The trend in sampled population size indicated positive exponential growth (Ninitial\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8950, Nlast\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89600), with intra-annual fluctuations becoming progressively more intense. Low survival was relevant during population decline at study onset, while at study end intense Individuals entrance promoted rapid population growth. Thus, the indirect effects of rainfall and the combined effect of two demographic rates operated synergistically on the immediate population abundance of Grey Pileated Finch, an abundant bird in a Neotropical dry forest.'

Abstract: 'We examined the spatial structure and regeneration of Tetramerista glabra, a dominant canopy tree in peat swamp rain forest in Borneo (West Kalimantan, Indonesia). T. glabra has strong spatial structure that changes dramatically during the life cycle; seedlings were highly aggregated, saplings were random and trees were evenly distributed. Germination and seedling relative growth were highest within canopy gaps, but seedling densities were highest at gap edges. Concentration of seedlings in gap edges, rather than localized seed dispersal, was responsible for seedling patchiness. The slope of the relationship between relative growth rate and seedling height decreased from gap, to gap edge to understory habitats, suggesting that competition within the seedling layer is more important in gaps than in the understory. The processes that break down seedling aggregation, leading to over-dispersion of trees, must be density dependent, but remain unknown.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents a case of planting and management of natural regeneration of shihuahuaco (Dipteryx spp.) by recent migrants in a Peruvian Amazonian logging frontier. We interviewed residents of three communities of smallholders in Irazola District, Province of Padre Abad, Region of Ucayali, located within the historic and actual boundaries of an active logging concession, and conducted growth studies of shihuahuaco trees planted in two mixed-species agroforestry fields, over a period of 3\xc2\xa0years. We found that the majority of landholders were managing the natural regeneration of valuable hardwood timber trees, and planting seedlings on their lands. Growth of shihuahuaco trees in agroforestry fields was comparable to growth rates in managed silvicultural plantations, which suggests the potential for local smallholders activities to contribute to conservation of genetic stock and eventual renewal of populations depleted by logging. We recommend greater recognition and inclusion of local people, with their innovative and productive silvicultural practices, in efforts to remediate the impacts of selective logging of high-value timber species.'

Abstract: 'Terrestrial ecosystem services can provide both direct and indirect economic benefits. In this case study, we estimated the annual economic value of some ecosystem services provided by terrestrial ecosystems in the Qinba mountains of Shaanxi Province of China, using both simulation models and a geographic information system that helps to analyze the effect of ecological factors on ecosystem functions. With respect to differences in vegetation types and their coverage, by combining the latest research, and using theory and methods for the value of terrestrial ecosystem services, we not only calculated goods produced by different types of vegetation but also estimated the value of various terrestrial ecosystem services. We also set up a database and an eco-account of a terrestrial ecosystem. The ecosystem services assessed relate to the following aspects: the vegetation\xe2\x80\x99s primary productivity, soil and fertility conservation, water conservation, carbon fixation and oxygen supply. The total economic value of terrestrial ecosystem services in the Qinba mountains was estimated to be 968.33 billion renminbi per year, and represents a part of the actual ecosystem services. In addition, we analyzed the spatial distribution of the vegetation based on the economic values of the terrestrial ecosystem services. Our findings can contribute to the conservation of these terrestrial ecosystems and the effective use of these ecosystem services.'

Abstract: 'Trees, perennial phanerophytes, display a rich variety of rhythmic phenomena. These are either due to exclusive environmental entrainment or due to the functioning of endogenous oscillators independent of the environment. Both types of rhythms are covered in this review. Purely environment controlled rhythms may be considered as a prelude to endogenous rhythms. Environment controlled rhythms discussed are (i) the diurnal rhythms of nyctinastic and heliotropic leaf movements and oscillatory phenomena of photosynthesis, such as the midday depression and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), and (ii) the annual rhythms of annual growth ring formation, autumnal leaf senescence, over wintering mechanisms and flowering. Among the diurnal rhythms, nyctinastic movements and CAM are also free-running endogenous rhythms showing the operation of circadian clocks in trees. In leaf senescence, over wintering, and flowering control, photoperiod sensing is involved which suggests the participation of endogenous clocks. A question asked is if diurnal and annual rhythms are mechanistically correlated. Evidently, phenological phenomena based on photoperiodism (as dependent on measurement of night length) are co-ordinately regulated by the phytochrome system and the circadian clocks and many aspects of annual developments and over wintering are linked to photoperiodism. The existence in trees of circadian clock genes as known to be anchored in the genome of A. thaliana can be assessed by attempts of alignment with the sequenced genome of Populus or by isolating cDNA clones from trees to check them against the genome of A. thaliana. At extreme latitudes near the equator and north of the polar circle trees also display photoperiod-independent phenological phenomena. In the polar region, total irradiance of red and far red light could possibly be involved and the signalling pathway then involves phytochrome, and thus, may still be similar to that of photoperiodism. At the equator, total daily light irradiance received or sensing the dynamics of daily changes in solar irradiance are essential and it remains enigmatic whether signalling cascades are either attached to the circadian clocks in a still unknown way or totally independent of circadian clocks.'

Abstract: 'Studies were undertaken on the floristic composition and stand structure of four 1 hectare plots in the lowland forests of Kurupukari, Guyana. A total of 3897 trees, covering 153 species and 31 plant families were recorded at greater than 5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh). The number of species per hectare ranged from 61 to 84 (>5.0 cm dbh) and 50\xe2\x80\x9371 (>10.0 cm dbh). The total number of trees per hectare varied two-fold between study plots, with 45\xe2\x80\x9350% of the trees within the 5\xe2\x80\x9310 cm size-class. Mean total basal area varied from 32.39\xe2\x80\x9334.63 m2 per 100 m2. The four most dominant plant families represented 43.8% of the total number of trees, while representing only 11.2% of the species. No one plant family dominated in more than one of the four study plots, and all four plots held at least one plant family with more than 20% of the total number of trees. Although 14 tree species were common to all four plots, only 26%\xe2\x80\x9335% of the species were represented by a single tree. Between three and seven species represented 50% of the trees within all size-classes, with species dominance occurring within the highest density plot.'

Abstract: 'World soils and terrestrial ecosystems have been a source of atmospheric abundance of CO2 ever since settled agriculture began about 10\xe2\x80\x9313\xc2\xa0millennia ago. The amount of CO2-C emitted into the atmosphere is estimated at 136\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa055\xc2\xa0Pg from terrestrial ecosystems, of which emission from world soils is estimated at 78\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa012\xc2\xa0Pg. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems decreases soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by 30\xe2\x80\x9350% over 50\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0years in temperate regions, and 50\xe2\x80\x9375% over 20\xe2\x80\x9350\xc2\xa0years in tropical climates. The projected global warming, with estimated increase in mean annual temperature of 4\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xb0C by 2100, may have a profound impact on the total soil C pool and its dynamics. The SOC pool may increase due to increase in biomass production and accretion into the soil due to the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cCO2 fertilization effect\xe2\x80\x9d, which may also enhance production of the root biomass. Increase in weathering of silicates due to increase in temperature, and that of the formation of secondary carbonates due to increase in partial pressure of CO2 in soil air may also increase the total C pool. In contrast, however, SOC pool may decrease because of: (i) increase in rate of respiration and mineralization, (ii) increase in losses by soil erosion, and (iii) decrease in protective effects of stable aggregates which encapsulate organic matter. Furthermore, the relative increase in temperature projected to be more in arctic and boreal regions, will render Cryosols under permafrost from a net sink to a net source of CO2 if and when permafrost thaws. Thus, SOC pool of world soils may decrease with increase in mean global temperature. In contrast, the biotic pool may increase primarily because of the CO2 fertilization effect. The magnitude of CO2 fertilization effect may be constrained by lack of essential nutrients (e.g., N, P) and water. The potential of SOC sequestration in agricultural soils of Europe is 70\xe2\x80\x93190\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921. This potential is realizable through adoption of recommended land use and management, and restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems including wetlands.'

Abstract: "Sending color signals to conspecifics may attract predators, leading to opposing selection pressures on the evolution of signal expression and display behavior in animals. The costs of signaling can be reduced, however, because conspicuousness is the combined result of the reflectance spectra of the displayer's color pattern and the spectra of ambient light illuminating the animal. Changes in ambient light can alter conspicuousness, even when chemical and structural color-generating mechanisms remain constant, potentially allowing animals to display their colors most fully in light environments where the benefits are greatest relative to the costs. Using spectroradiometric methods, we determined how light habitat use affects conspicuousness in adult males of the Wire-tailed Manakin Pipra filicauda, a lekking bird species with vivid plumage colors. We studied three aspects of visibility, including properties of the entire color pattern, visual contrast within an individual's plumage and a bird's contrast relative to its visual background. Wire-tailed Manakins usually displayed in forest shade environments, which reduced their conspicuousness at larger viewing distances, while maximizing visual contrast within the plumage color pattern at close viewing distances. Compared to sunspots, ambient light in forest shade reduces the contrast of individual bird colors with the background at close viewing distance. However, background contrast of individual bird colors in the shade was still relatively higher during sunny than during cloudy weather which may explain why males were more active when the sun was not blocked by clouds. Assuming that the visual perceptions of predators and other manakins do not differ from the reflectance patterns we measured, Wire-tailed manakins tend to display in light environments that reduce the conflicts between avoiding long distance detection by predators and displaying conspicuous color signals to visiting females."

Abstract: 'The population structure and dynamics of Castanopsis cuspidata var. sieboldii were studied to evaluate vegetative and sapling regeneration in an old-growth, evergreen broad-leaved forest exposed to low-severity typhoon disturbances by annual typhoons on the Tsushima Islands in Japan. The density of individuals \xe2\x89\xa55\xe2\x80\x89cm d.b.h. was 38.0\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921 in 1990; 7.9% were multiple-stemmed individuals. Over the 7-year study period (1990\xe2\x80\x931997), the number of individuals decreased, although the number of stems increased. Over 30% of apparently dead individuals were reconstituted by sprouting stems. Compared with sprout regeneration, sapling regeneration rarely occurred and was only observed in canopy gaps. Most individuals had at least one sprout shoot (H \xe2\x89\xa530\xe2\x80\x89cm, d.b.h. <5\xe2\x80\x89cm), and the number and size of sprout shoots increased as the size of the individuals increased. During the study period, larger individuals with stem breakage tended to produce sprout stems. The density of saplings was 1074\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921 and they were more abundant in canopy gaps than under closed canopies, but large saplings were very rare even in canopy gaps. The population of C.\xe2\x80\x89cuspidata var. sieboldii consisted primarily of single-stemmed individuals with a few multiple-stemmed individuals providing a sprout bank. Larger individuals responded to the low severity typhoon disturbances and formed sprout stems. Although many saplings were observed, regeneration occurred more often by sprout formation than by growth of saplings. Thus, sprout regeneration is an important mode of regeneration, which allows this pioneer-like species to maintain its population in this forest.'

Abstract: 'A carbon sequestration strategy has recently been proposed in which a forest is actively managed, and a fraction of the wood is selectively harvested and stored to prevent decomposition. The forest serves as a \xe2\x80\x98carbon scrubber\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98carbon remover\xe2\x80\x99 that provides continuous sequestration (negative emissions). Earlier estimates of the theoretical potential of wood harvest and storage (WHS) based on coarse wood production rates were 10\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895\xc2\xa0GtC y\xe2\x88\x921. Starting from this physical limit, here we apply a number of practical constraints: (1) land not available due to agriculture; (2) forest set aside as protected areas, assuming 50\xc2\xa0% in the tropics and 20\xc2\xa0% in temperate and boreal forests; (3) forests difficult to access due to steep terrain; (4) wood use for other purposes such as timber and paper. This \xe2\x80\x98top-down\xe2\x80\x99 approach yields a WHS potential 2.8\xc2\xa0GtC y\xe2\x88\x921. Alternatively, a \xe2\x80\x98bottom-up\xe2\x80\x99 approach, assuming more efficient wood use without increasing harvest, finds 0.1\xe2\x80\x930.5\xc2\xa0GtC y\xe2\x88\x921 available for carbon sequestration. We suggest a range of 1\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0GtC y\xe2\x88\x921 carbon sequestration potential if major effort is made to expand managed forests and/or to increase harvest intensity. The implementation of such a scheme at our estimated lower value of 1\xc2\xa0GtC y\xe2\x88\x921 would imply a doubling of the current world wood harvest rate. This can be achieved by harvesting wood at a moderate harvesting intensity of 1.2\xc2\xa0tC ha\xe2\x88\x921 y\xe2\x88\x921, over a forest area of 8\xc2\xa0Mkm2 (800\xc2\xa0Mha). To achieve the higher value of 3\xc2\xa0GtC y\xe2\x88\x921, forests need to be managed this way on half of the world\xe2\x80\x99s forested land, or on a smaller area but with higher harvest intensity. We recommend WHS be considered part of the portfolio of climate mitigation and adaptation options that needs further research.'

Abstract: 'Tree bean, Parkia timoriana (DC.) Merr. (Fabaceae) is an underutilized nutritious leguminous tree found in North-eastern states of India and other Southeast Asian countries. Ethnobotanically, tree bean has much importance among the ethnic groups in various states of Northeast India. Decoctions of bark, fruit and leaf parts are used to treat various diseases. Right from flowers and tender pods to mature seeds of this plant are edible, provide a good source of nutrients and fetch high market price during particular seasons. Cultivation of this tree will not compete with other legumes in an existing field and it could be a supplementary source of vegetable proteins if properly exploited. Anti-nutritional factors, total free phenols, tannins and lectins can be eliminated if the seeds are properly processed by heating or cooking since these factors are heat-labile. Only a few researchers worked on phyto-constituents of the plant with lacuna in nutritional studies and pharmacological activities. The plant has been reported to possess antioxidant, \xce\xb1-glucosidase and \xce\xb1-amylase inhibitory properties, antibacterial, antidiabetic, antiproliferative and insecticidal activities. Though it has much importance in commercial purposes, research and knowledge on this wonder plant is meagre and its utilization for human consumption has not yet been fully exploited. The present review is aimed to provide a botanical description and highlights ethnobotanical uses, nutritional value and biological activities along with its toxicity and future prospects.'

Abstract: 'With the aim of determining what kind of landscape mosaics might sustainmaximum diversity and minimum species loss, dung beetles were sampled withbaited pitfall traps to compare species richness and species composition in atract of continuous forest, forest fragments and a habitat island consisting ofa mosaic of forest and arboreal crops in Los Tuxtlas, southern Mexico. Wecaptured 7332 dung beetles representing 33 species. Similar numbers of specieswere captured in the three habitats. However, 56% of individuals were capturedin the continuous forest, 29% in the mosaic habitat and 15% in the forestfragments. Eight species (Canthon femoralis,Copris laeviceps, Canthidium centrale,Onthophagus batesi, Deltochilumpseudoparile, O. rhinolophus, Canthonviridis vazquezae and Dichotomius satanus) accounted for 90% of thecaptures, but their relative dominance varied among habitats. A clear trend wasevident in the number of dung beetles captured in the dung processing guilds(rollers/tunnelers) as well as in the diurnal and nocturnal guilds, withcaptures decreasing from the continuous forest to the mosaic habitat to theforest fragments. A similar trend was detected in detection rates for medium andsmall size dung producing mammals. Species richness of forest fragments andmosaic habitat did not differ from that found in the continuous forest, butthese habitats differ significantly in species richness from isolated shaded andunshaded plantations, linear strips of vegetation, the forest\xe2\x80\x93pasture edge andpastures according to rarefaction analysis. The co-occurrence of the continuousforest, the mosaic habitat and the cluster of forest fragments in closeproximity seems to be preserving a diverse assemblage of dung beetle species inthe local landscape.'

Abstract: 'In many species with a resource-based mating system, males defend resources to increase their attractiveness to females. In the strawberry poison frog, Dendrobates pumilio, suitable tadpole-rearing sites appear to be a limited resource for females. Territorial males have been suggested to defend tadpole-rearing sites to increase their access to females. In this study we investigate the spatial association between tadpole-rearing sites and the sexes as well as the spatial association of males and females. If strawberry poison frogs have resource defense polygyny, we expect males and females to be associated with tadpole-rearing sites and that females will deposit their offspring in tadpole-rearing sites inside the territories of their mates. To test this hypothesis, home range and core area sizes were calculated for both sexes and the association patterns were compared in two areas that differed in their abundance of tadpole-rearing sites. Home ranges and core areas of females were much larger than male home ranges. Females showed a clumped distribution in the vicinity of tadpole-rearing sites. Males were not clumped and were less associated with tadpole-rearing sites. Females generally did not use tadpole-rearing sites in the territory of their mates and we therefore conclude that males did not defend tadpole-rearing sites for females. Our data are consistent with the general assumption that female distribution is influenced by resource distribution and that male distribution depends on female distribution. Nevertheless,  the distribution of D. pumilio females was also influenced by male spacing patterns. Males probably initially establish their core areas where female density is high and then females move among territories to sample males. Males compete vigorously for places with high female density, the defense of which is likely important for enhancing their mating success. In general, the spacing patterns did not differ between populations but the sex ratio was strongly female biased in the habitat with more tadpole-rearing sites, reflecting the direct reliance of females on these resources.'

Abstract: 'Strong anthropogenic pressure, mainly mineral extraction, is one of the main factors leading to degradation of the Brazilian coastal environment. Strategies to recover these areas include replanting native plant species, and symbiotic fungi from the neighboring area might be important for the establishment of the new vegetation. Species richness, diversity and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were investigated in NE Brazil in two natural areas, \xe2\x80\x98restinga\xe2\x80\x99 forest and seaside \xe2\x80\x98restinga\xe2\x80\x99, and in two areas of revegetated dunes after mining activity 20 and 8\xc2\xa0years ago. Soil samples were collected during the dry (March) and wet (September) seasons of 2009 in Mataraca, Para\xc3\xadba State, Brazil. Based on glomerospore morphology, 34 species of AMF were recorded, of which 29 were identified in field samples and five after trap culturing, with the greatest diversity and richness found in the dune revegetated 8\xc2\xa0years ago. The sampling effort allowed an assessment of between 70 and 80\xc2\xa0% of the species estimated for the areas by the first-order Jackknife index. Among the generalist species Gigaspora margarita was the only one found in all areas and during both collection periods. The similarity of AMF species between the revegetated areas and the seaside \xe2\x80\x98restinga\xe2\x80\x99 was >60\xc2\xa0%, supporting the hypothesis that this area represents a source of propagules, but the substrate used for seedling production may also bring other species, enabling the recovery of the AMF community in the mined and revegetated dunes.'

Abstract: 'Nowadays, adaptation has become a key focus of the scientific and policy-making communities and is a major area of discussion in the multilateral climate change process. As climate change is projected to hit the poorest the hardest, it is especially important for developing countries to pay particular attention to the management of natural resources and agricultural activities. In most of these countries such as Cameroon, forest can play important role in achieving broader climate change adaptation goals. However, forest generally receives very little attention in national development programme and strategies such as policy dialogues on climate change and poverty reduction strategies. Using a qualitative approach to data collection through content analysis of relevant Cameroon policy documents, the integration of climate change adaptation was explored and the level of attention given to forests for adaptation analysed. Results indicate that, with the exception of the First National Communication to UNFCCC that focused mostly on mitigation and related issues, current policy documents in Cameroon are void of tangible reference to climate change, and hence failing in drawing the relevance of forest in sheltering populations from the many projected impacts of climate change. Policies related to forest rely on a generalized concept of sustainable forest management and do not identify the specific changes that need to be incorporated into management strategies and policies towards achieving adaptation. The strategies and recommendations made in those documents only serve to improve understanding of Cameroon natural resources and add resilience to the natural systems in coping with anthropogenic stresses. The paper draws attention to the need to address the constraints of lack of awareness and poor flow of information on the potentials of forests for climate change adaptation. It highlights the need for integrating forest for adaptation into national development programmes and strategies, and recommends a review of the existing environmental legislations and their implications on poverty reduction strategy and adaptation to climate change.'

Abstract: 'Toad species Rhinella marina and R. schneideri (Bufonidae, Anura) are widely distributed in Amazon and Cerrado/Caatinga, respectively. Recent data has hypothesized that these two toad species share a history of a massive introgressive hybridization. Therefore, the aim of the present work was the precise identification of organisms with signs of past introgression or actual ongoing hybridization. In this paper we conducted a method based on polymerase chain reaction\xe2\x80\x93restriction fragment length polymorphism, through the use of the CfoI enzyme. The individuals of R. marina have two specific digested bands, which is not digested in R. schneideri, possessing the hybrids three bands. The method was very efficient and allowed fast identification of these species.'

Abstract: 'Biochar (BC) is a common minor constituent of soils and is usually derived from the burning of wood materials. In the case of Amazonian dark earth (ADE) soils, the increased amount of this material is believed to be due to anthropogenic action by ancient indigenous populations. In this study, we use 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to assess the bacterial diversity observed in the BC found in ADEs as well as in the dark earth itself and the adjacent Acrisol. Samples were taken from two sites, one cultivated with manioc and one with secondary forest cover. Analyses revealed that the community structure found in each sample had unique features. At a coarse phylogenetic resolution, the most abundant phyla in all sequence libraries were Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria that were present in similar relative abundance across all samples. However, the class composition varied between them highlighting the difference between the Acrisol and the remaining samples. This result was also corroborated by the comparison of the OTU composition (at 97\xc2\xa0% identity). Also, soil coverage has shown an effect over the community structure observed in all samples. This pattern was found to be significant through unweighted UniFrac as well as P tests. These results indicate that, although the ADEs are found in patches within the Acrisols, the contrasting characteristics found between them led to the development of significantly different communities.'

Abstract: 'Using data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), we examine how near-global (60\xc2\xb0N\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xb0S) high cloud fraction varies over time in the past three decades. Our focus is on identifying dominant modes of variability and associated spatial patterns, and how they are related to sea surface temperature. By performing the principal component analysis, we find that the first two principal modes of high cloud distribution show strong imprints of the two types of El Ni\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x93Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\xe2\x80\x94the canonical ENSO and the ENSO Modoki. Comparisons between ISCCP data and 14 models from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (AMIP5) show that models simulate the spatial pattern and the temporal variations of high cloud fraction associated with the canonical ENSO very well but the magnitudes of the canonical ENSO vary among the models. Furthermore, the multi-model mean of the second principal mode in the AMIP5 simulations appears to capture the temporal behavior of the second mode but individual AMIP5 models show large discrepancies in capturing observed temporal variations. A new metric, defined by the relative variances of the first two principal components, suggests that most of the AMIP5 models overestimate the second principal mode of high clouds.'

Abstract: 'Characteristics of higher plant terpenoids that result in mediation of numerous kinds of ecological interactions are discussed as a framework for this Symposium on Chemical Ecology of Terpenoids. However, the role of terpenoid mixtures, either constitutive or induced, their intraspecific qualitative and quantitative compositional variation, and their dosage-dependent effects are emphasized in subsequent discussions. It is suggested that little previous attention to these characteristics may have contributed to terpenoids having been misrepresented in some chemical defense theories. Selected phytocentric examples of terpenoid interactions are presented: (1) defense against generalist and specialist insect and mammalian herbivores, (2) defense against insect-vectored fungi and potentially pathogenic endophytic fungi, (3) attraction of entomophages and pollinators, (4) allelopathic effects that inhibit seed germination and soil bacteria, and (5) interaction with reactive troposphere gases. The results are integrated by discussing how these terpenoids may be contributing factors in determining some properties of terrestrial plant communities and ecosystems. A terrestrial phytocentric approach is necessitated due to the magnitude and scope of terpenoid interactions. This presentation has a more broadly based ecological perspective than the several excellent recent reviews of the ecological chemistry of terpenoids.'

Abstract: 'What distinguishes environmental refugees from other refugees\xe2\x80\x94or other migrants? Are all environmental refugees alike? This essay develops a classification to begin to answer these questions and facilitate future policies and research on environmental refugees. Environmental refugees may have considerable control over the decision to migrate, but this varies by the type of environmental disruption. The origin, intention, and duration of environmental disruptions shape the type of refugee. Refugees from disasters and expropriations have limited control over whether environmental changes will produce migration. Gradual degradation allows \xe2\x80\x9cenvironmental emigrants\xe2\x80\x9d to determine how they will respond to environmental change.'

Abstract: 'Across the world there is a prevailing view that freshwater algae are cosmopolitan. The notion has seldom been tested and is unlikely to be true in genetic terms. Nonetheless, some morphospecies of several groups of algae do have a worldwide distribution. Others have restricted distributions and may be regarded as endemic to a region. However there is always the possibility that they will be discovered in far away places. Australia has a rather large element of endemicity in its algal flora. From the early days of Australian phycology many new genera and species of freshwater algae have been described. Some are of such distinctive appearance or novelty as to be regarded as \xe2\x80\x98flagship\xe2\x80\x99 taxa. There is little doubt about their endemicity and their existence increases the probability of less-distinguished species also being endemic. The degree of endemicity is probably masked by the \xe2\x80\x98force-fitting\xe2\x80\x99 of European names to Australian species.'

Abstract: 'The present study has generated spatial databases on the vegetation type with plant biodiversity, forest fragmentation and disturbance regimes in Tamilnadu parts of Eastern Ghats (EG), India. These databases have been analysed geospatially with landscape ecology approach. The study also includes ground inventory of plant species based on Remote Sensing (RS) data stratification. The vegetation type map was generated from the visual interpretation of two season IRS LISS III data. The spatial landscape analysis of the remotely sensed interpreted images was carried out using customized software, SPLAM. This is first such study in Tamilnadu Eastern Ghats that provides a comprehensive spatial database on vegetation types, disturbance regime and plant species diversity. The study has shown that the dry deciduous and thorn forests have shown better resistance to disturbance compared to the most disturbed evergreen and semievergreen forests. The study outputs are being utilized by forest department and biodiversity boards for conservation action planning and compliance to Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).'

Abstract: 'There are at least two assumptions which, except for very few occasions, have not been discussed by philosophers who have written on the metaphysics of technological objects. The first assumption is that to be a technology is an absolute matter and that all technological objects are equally technological. The second assumption is that the property of being technological is abstracted from existing things which happen to have this property in common. I appeal to the definition of technological objects as problem-solving physical instruments to show that (i) things can be technological to different degrees, and that (ii) the property of being technological is more fundamental than being a technology.'

Abstract: 'The aquatic and semi-aquatic Heteroptera, consisting of the infraorders Leptopodomorpha, Gerromorpha, and Nepomorpha, comprise a significant component of the world\xe2\x80\x99s aquatic insect biota. Within these three infraorders as a whole there are currently 23 families, 343 genera and 4,810 species group taxa considered valid, of which 20 families, 326 genera and 4,656 species inhabit freshwater. In addition, more than 1,100 unequivocally diagnosed species remain to be described. Aquatic Heteroptera occur on all continents except Antarctica, and are most numerous in the tropical regions, although there are many distinctly cold-adapted genera. Overall species richness is highest in the Neotropical and Oriental regions, which harbor 1,289 and 1,103 species, respectively. In comparison to these core tropical regions, species richness is significantly lower in the Afrotropical (799 species), Australasian (654 species), Palearctic (496 species), Nearctic (424 species) and Pacific (37 species) regions. Aquatic Heteroptera are notable for utilizing an exceptionally broad range of habitats, from marine and intertidal to arctic and high alpine, across a global altitudinal range of 0\xe2\x80\x934,700\xc2\xa0m. Species may be found in almost every freshwater biotope, and many exhibit striking morphological adaptations to their aquatic environment, making them excellent subjects for ecological and biogeographic studies.'

Abstract: 'Ecosystems contribute to economic development through the supply of ecosystem services such as food and fresh water. Information on ecosystems and their services is required to support policy making, but this information is not captured in economic statistics. Ecosystem accounting has been developed to integrate ecosystems and ecosystem services into national accounts. Ecosystem accounting includes the compilation of an ecosystem services supply and use account, which reflects actual flows of ecosystem services, and the ecosystem capacity account, which reflects the capacity of ecosystems to sustainably supply ecosystem services. A capacity assessment requires detailed data on ecosystem processes, which are often not available over large scales. In this study, we examined how net primary productivity derived from remote sensing can be used as an indicator to assess changes in the capacity of ecosystems to supply services. We examine the spatial and temporal patterns in this capacity for the Orinoco river basin from 2001 to 2014. Specifically, we analyze the capacity of six types of ecosystems to supply timber, pastures for grazing cattle, oil palm fresh fruit bunches and to sequester carbon. We compared ecosystem capacities with the level of ecosystem service supply to assess a sustainable use of ecosystems. Our study provides insights on how the capacity of ecosystems can be quantified using remote sensing data in the context of ecosystem accounting. Ecosystem capacity indicators indicate ecosystems change and harvesting-regeneration patterns which are important for the design and monitoring of sustainable management regimes for ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry has become an important land use type in Central and South America. It is important to study agroforestry systems because of their ability to sequester carbon. This study investigates plantations that are located in the foothills of the Peruvian Andes, and it evaluates the aboveground and soil carbon storage of agroforestry coffee plantations with different dominant shading trees, including Inga spp., Pinus spp. (both 15\xc2\xa0years old) and Eucalyptus spp. (7\xc2\xa0years old). These agroforestry systems were also compared to a coffee plantation without shading trees. Biomass and carbon were estimated for trees and coffee shrubs using allometric equations. Soil (within depth of 30\xc2\xa0cm) and litter carbon were estimated using field sampling and laboratory analyses. The total carbon stock for the site dominated by Inga spp. was 119.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa019.5\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, while for the sites dominated by Pinus spp. it was 177.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa014.1\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 and for the site dominated by Eucalyptus spp. it was 162.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa018.2\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. In the Sun coffee site the ecosystem carbon stock was 99.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa017.2\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. Most carbon was fixed in the soil compartment (57\xe2\x80\x9399\xc2\xa0%), followed by aboveground tree biomass (23\xe2\x80\x9332\xc2\xa0%), tree belowground biomass (8\xe2\x80\x939\xc2\xa0%), coffee shrubs (0.2\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0%) and litter (1\xc2\xa0%).'

Abstract: 'Soil samples were collected and analyzed from 25 sites of three hilly regions (Rangamati, Banderban and Khagrachari) for an understanding of the impact of denudation and land use on soils in Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh. There were natural forests, bushy land, slashed sites, slashed and burnt sites, and the sites prepared for shifting cultivation, one year after shifting cultivation and two years after shifting cultivation. The soils were generally yellowish brown to reddish brown, sandy to sandy clay loam, strongly acid, and well to excessively drained on steep slopes with considerable variation among the sites and land use categories. Bulk density was the highest in sites of one year after shifting cultivation (1.52 g\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x88\x923) and the lowest in forested sites (1.38 g\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x88\x923). Water holding capacities were, however, statistically similar in all sites. Organic carbon varied from 0.54% (slashed and burnt sites) to 1.55% (forested sites) and total N ranged from 0.05% (shifting cultivation for one year) to 0.13% (forested sites). Available phosphorus (Bray & Kurtz-2 P) was the maximum in forested sites (12.32 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921), and it did not differ significantly in other sites. Contents of available Ca, Mg and K were also higher in the bushy lands and forested sites than cleared and shifting cultivated sites.'

Abstract: 'The process of forest fragmentation, a common phenomenon occurring in tropical forests, not only results into continuously forest getting fragmented but also brings about several physical and biological changes in the environment of forests. Consequently, there is a loss of biodiversity due to change in habitat conditions. These remnant fragments provide the last hope for biodiversity conservation. The present study deals with the impact of decreasing patch size of a fragmented forest on the diversity of the tropical dry deciduous forests in Vindhyan highlands, India. There is considerable change in the vegetation cover of this region owing to rapid industrialization and urbanization, which has also contributed to forest fragmentation. In the present study, remotely sensed data has been used to describe the changes brought about in vegetated areas over a period of 10\xc2\xa0years as a result of fragmentation and its impact on biodiversity was assessed. Further, in order to assess the loss of species with respect to the reduction in patch size, species area curves for various change areas were analysed. It was observed that the rate of decrease in the number of species is faster in the case of negative change areas as compared to the positive change areas of the region. Various diversity indices also support this observation. Such an analysis would help in formulating appropriate conservation measures for the region.'

Abstract: "Movement of soil particles in atmospheres is a normal planetary process. Images of Martian dust devils (wind-spouts) and dust storms captured by NASA's Pathfinder have demonstrated the significant role that storm activity plays in creating the red atmospheric haze of Mars. On Earth, desert soils moving in the atmosphere are responsible for the orange hues in brilliant sunrises and sunsets. In severe dust storm events, millions of tons of soil may be moved across great expanses of land and ocean. An emerging scientific interest in the process of soil transport in the Earth's atmosphere is in the field of public and ecosystem health. This article will address the benefits and the potential hazards associated with exposure to particle fallout as clouds of desert dust traverse the globe."

Abstract: 'Aerosols can affect the cloud-radiation feedback and the precipitation over the Indian monsoon region. In this paper, we propose that another pathway by which aerosols can modulate the multi-scale aspect of Indian monsoons is by altering the land\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere interactions. The nonlinear feedbacks due to aerosol/diffuse radiation on coupled interactions over the Indian monsoon region are studied by: (1) reviewing recent field measurements and modeling studies, (2) analyzing the MODIS and AERONET aerosol optical depth datasets, and (3) diagnosing the results from sensitivity experiments using a mesoscale modeling system. The results of this study suggest that the large magnitude of aerosol loading and its impact on land\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere interactions can significantly influence the mesoscale monsoonal characteristics in the Indo-Ganges Basin.'

Abstract: 'The high spatial variability of soil respiration in tropical rainforests is well evaluated, but influences of biotic factors are not clearly understood. This study underlines the influence of tree species characteristics on soil respiration across a 16-monospecific plot design in a tropical plantation of French Guiana. A large variability of soil CO2 fluxes was observed among plots (i.e. 2.8 to 6.8\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921) with the ranking being constant across seasons. There were no significant relationships between soil respiration and soil moisture or soil temperature, neither spatially, nor seasonally. The variability of soil respiration was mainly explained by quantitative factors such as leaf litterfall and basal area. Surprisingly, no significant relationship was observed between soil respiration and root biomass. However, the influence of substrate quality was revealed by a strong relationship between soil respiration and litterfall P (and litterfall N, to a lesser extent).'

Abstract: 'In many areas of the world, current theories for agricultural origins emphasize yield as a major concern during intensification. In Africa, however, the need for scheduled consumption shaped the development of food production. African cattle were domesticated during the tenth millennium BP by delayed-return Saharan hunter-gatherers in unstable, marginal environments where predictable access to resources was a more significant problem than absolute abundance. Pastoralism spread patchily across the continent according to regional variations in the relative predictability of herding versus hunting and gathering. Domestication of African plants was late (after 4000 BP) because of the high mobility of herders, and risk associated with cultivation in arid environments. Renewed attention to predictability may contribute to understanding the circumstances that led to domestication in other regions of the world.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian savannah is the second largest biome of the country, and it displays great biodiversity. The fruits of the native trees have peculiar characteristics and are recognized for their nutritional and therapeutic aspects. However, little is known about their technological and biotechnological potential applications. The existing information concerning these aspects has never been compiled so far. It is known that many of these fruits contain many bioactive compounds of industrial interest, such as carotenoids and phenolic constituents. Another aspect of the fruit is the high fatty acid content of some species. Pequi, bocaiuva, jatoba, baru, amburama, and buriti, for instance, are among those fruits described as being rich in fatty acids, mostly unsaturated ones. Here, we reviewed 18 species from the Brazilian savannah identified to be of interest because of high potencial for sustained medium- and short-term explorations, under the technological and biotechnological aspects, seeking the development of new products from these scarcely studied raw materials.'

Abstract: 'Guatteria, Guatteriopsis, Guatteriella andHeteropetalum share the same conspicuous pollen type which is new for theSpermatophyta. It is zonoaperturate with a folded aperture region and an extremely reduced exine. First chromosome counts and karyotype analyses forGuatteriopsis (4 species investigated) andGuatteriella (1 species) are identical with those ofGuatteria (19 species seen): 2n = 28. The genome is characterized by diploidization and partly telocentric chromosomes. Sequentially Giemsa C- and fluorochrome banded chromosomes and interphase nuclei are described. The cuticular folding pattern is distinct forHeteropetalum only. Growth forms and ecology are reported for many species. The evolutionary pattern of theGuatteria group is discussed and compared with other genera and families.'

Abstract: 'The conversion of tropical forests to other land use forms is known to affect biogeochemical processes, but its influence on asymbiotic nitrogen fixation (ANF) remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate patterns of soil ANF and its biogeochemical controls across multiple land uses and topographic positions in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We report ANF rates derived from observational and manipulative laboratory experiments using 15N-labeled dinitrogen (15N2) incubations of soils from primary forest, secondary forest, eucalypt plantations and pastures sampled at three hillslope positions (summit, backslope, and footslope). Our field observations revealed significant interactions between land use and topography on ANF rates, which among 14 measured soil parameters were primarily correlated with total nitrogen and available iron (explaining 69% of ANF variance). Complex non-linear relationships were observed between ANF and (mineral and organic) nutrient pools in forest soils, whereas simple positive linear relationships were found between ANF and total soil nitrogen in managed pastures and plantations. Consistent with this observation, experiments with nitrogen and phosphorus addition did not affect ANF rates in pasture or plantation soils, possibly as a result of previous fertilization and homogenization of plant and microbial communities, but variable positive and negative ANF responses were measured in primary and secondary forest soils depending on hillslope position. These findings show that ANF can be simultaneously affected by multiple variables that are sensitive to environmental conditions and demonstrate the need for considering land-use change and topography to improve predictions of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles.'

Abstract: 'A series of eight watersheds on the Pacific coast of Panama where conversion of mature lowland wet forest to pastures by artisanal burning provided watershed-scale experimental units with a wide range of forest cover (23, 29, 47, 56, 66, 73, 73, 91, and 92\xc2\xa0%). We used these watersheds as a landscape-scale experiment to assess effects of degree of deforestation on within-watershed retention and hydrological export of atmospheric inputs of nutrients. Retention was estimated by comparing rainfall nutrient concentrations (volume-weighted to allow for evapotranspiration) to concentrations in freshwater reaches of receiving streams. Retention of rain-derived nutrients in these Panama watersheds averaged 77, 85, 80, and 62\xc2\xa0% for nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic N, and phosphate, respectively. Retention of rain-derived inorganic nitrogen, however, depended on watershed cover: retention of nitrate and ammonium in pasture-dominated watersheds was 95 and 98\xc2\xa0%, while fully forested watersheds retained 65 and 80\xc2\xa0% of atmospheric nitrate and ammonium inputs. Watershed forest cover did not affect retention of dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphate. Exports from more forested watersheds yielded DIN/P near 16, while pasture-dominated watersheds exported N/P near 2. The differences in magnitude of exports and ratios suggest that deforestation in these Panamanian forests results in exports that affect growth of plants and algae in the receiving stream and estuarine ecosystems. Watershed retention of dissolved inorganic nitrogen calculated from wet plus dry atmospheric deposition varied from 90\xc2\xa0% in pasture- to 65\xc2\xa0% in forest-dominated watersheds, respectively. Discharges of DIN to receiving waters from the watersheds therefore rose from 10\xc2\xa0% of atmospheric inputs for pasture-dominated watersheds, to about 35\xc2\xa0% of atmospheric inputs for fully forested watersheds. These results from watersheds with no agriculture or urbanization, but different conversion of forest to pasture by burning, show significant, deforestation-dependent retention within tropical watersheds, but also ecologically significant, and deforestation-dependent, exports that are biologically significant because of the paucity of nutrients in receiving tropical stream and coastal waters.'

Abstract: 'Nodal expiants ofSpilanthes acmella produced normal multiple shoots when cultured vertically on Murashige and Skoog medium (1962) supplemented with 0.5 mg IT1 BA. The number of shoots formed from each expiant was doubled after first 5-week subculture. The nodal expiants placed vertically in Erlenmeyer flask (250, 500, or 1000 mL) produced more multiple shoots than those cultured in 350 mL jam bottles and 500 mL tex-Z flask. Temperature above 28C caused abnormalities of in vitro plantlets. All in vitro plantlets survived after acclimatized and transferred to the outside environment The survived plantlets did not show any morphological abnormalities in the field condition.'

Abstract: 'Tropical dry forest is the most widely distributed land-cover type in the tropics. As the rate of land-use/land-cover change from forest to pasture or agriculture accelerates worldwide, it is becoming increasingly important to quantify the ecosystem biomass and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools of both intact forests and converted sites. In the central coastal region of M\xc3\xa9xico, we sampled total aboveground biomass (TAGB), and the N and C pools of two floodplain forests, three upland dry forests, and four pastures converted from dry forest. We also sampled belowground biomass and soil C and N pools in two sites of each land-cover type. The TAGB of floodplain forests was as high as 416 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931, whereas the TAGB of the dry forest ranged from 94 to 126 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931. The TAGB of pastures derived from dry forest ranged from 20 to 34 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931. Dead wood (standing and downed combined) comprised 27%\xe2\x80\x9329% of the TABG of dry forest but only about 10% in floodplain forest. Root biomass averaged 32.0 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in floodplain forest, 17.1 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in dry forest, and 5.8 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in pasture. Although total root biomass was similar between sites within land-cover types, root distribution varied by depth and by size class. The highest proportion of root biomass occurred in the top 20 cm of soil in all sites. Total aboveground and root C pools, respectively, were 12 and 2.2 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in pasture and reached 180 and 12.9 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in floodplain forest. Total aboveground and root pools, respectively, were 149 and 47 kg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in pasture and reached 2623 and 264 kg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in floodplain forest. Soil organic C pools were greater in pastures than in dry forest, but soil N pools were similar when calculated for the same soil depths. Total ecosystem C pools were 306. The Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in floodplain forest, 141 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in dry forest, and 124 Mg ha\xe2\x80\x931 in pasture. Soil C comprised 37%\xe2\x80\x9390% of the total ecosystem C, whereas soil N comprised 85%\xe2\x80\x9398% of the total. The N pools lack of a consistent decrease in soil pools caused by land-use change suggests that C and N losses  result from the burning of aboveground biomass. We estimate that in M\xc3\xa9xico, dry forest landscapes store approximately 2.3 Pg C, which is about equal to the C stored by the evergreen forests of that country (approximately 2.4 Pg C). Potential C emissions to the atmosphere from the burning of biomass in the dry tropical landscapes of M\xc3\xa9xico may amount to 708 Tg C, as compared with 569 Tg C from evergreen forests.'

Abstract: 'The combined roles of chemical and physical weathering have profound effects on the development of terrestrial ecosystems. Landscapes which are tectonically active are rapidly denudated and continually produce nutrient solutes from fresh bedrock. The chemical weathering yields are related to climate, but also to geologic factors such as uplift rates. Long-term nutrient production and the phase of ecological development are closely related to geological setting. Until recently, this relationship has not been seriously considered by ecologists. Our analysis of existing information suggests, however, not only that the nature and type of geologic processes provide significant insights into landscape, but also to ecological development. In this paper, we describe the impact of geologic uplift on the long term generation of soluble nutrients from bedrock by evaluating long-term data from a number of forested sites and comparing it to newly collected data from Taiwan, an area undergoing rapid tectonic uplift.'

Abstract: "The depletion of the world's natural resources continues relentlessly. Plants and animals alike are being trapped into ever more numerous shrinking pockets, as man advances to incorporate virgin estates into areas of productivity. The immediate consequence of such an all-out attack in the tropical areas of under-developed countries is the destruction of habitats and the likely break-up of food webs. The attendant disastrous effects on the reproduction of species, hence, puts natural selection at a premium. This scenario has distinctly impressed different people in different places. This suggests diverse sensitivity even for causes voiced in public as matters of sheer truism. The study concentrates on the examination of the dialectic nature/nurture controversy to see whether this may account for the state of disharmony recorded between man and nature. Conversion of nature is traditionally considered a realm of the scientific establishment. The study tries to suggest that the humanities cannot be left out in any debate on the interpretation of the environment. The synthesis reveals a blatant refusal of social determinism as causal agent and, with some reservation, projects biological determinism into sharp focus for pertinent consideration. The cautious reconciliation with parts of sociobiological tenets was regarded as inevitable once grasped that will, knowledge, and sensitivity, were interpreted as the foundation of the main teleological argument."

Abstract: '\nSoil moisture\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere feedback effects play an important role in several regions of the globe. For some of these regions, soil moisture memory may contribute significantly to the state and temporal variation of the regional climate. Identifying those regions can help to improve predictability in seasonal to decadal climate forecasts. In order to accurately simulate soil moisture memory and associated soil moisture\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere interactions, an adequate representation of soil hydrology is required. The present study investigates how different setups of a soil hydrology scheme affect soil moisture memory simulated by the global climate model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, ECHAM6/JSBACH. First, the standard setup is applied in which soil water is represented by a single soil moisture reservoir corresponding to the root zone. Second, a new five layer soil hydrology scheme is introduced where not only the root zone is differentiated into several layers but also layers below are added. Here, three variants of the new scheme are utilized to analyse how different characteristics of the soil hydrology and the associated fluxes influence soil moisture memory. Soil moisture memory of the different setups is analysed from global ECHAM6/JSBACH simulations forced by observed SST. Areas are highlighted where the regional climate seems to be sensitive to the improved representation of soil hydrology in the new setup and its variants. Results indicate that soil moisture memory is generally enlarged in regions during the dry season where a soil moisture buffer is present below the root zone due to the 5-layer scheme. This effect is usually enhanced when this buffer is increased. Memory tends to be weakened (strengthened) where bare soil evaporation is increased (decreased), especially in semi-arid regions and wet seasons. For some areas, this effect is compensated by a decreased (increased) transpiration.'

Abstract: 'The effect of high precipitation regime in tropical forests is poorly known despite indications of its potentially negative effects on nutrient availability and carbon (C) cycling. Our goal was to determine if there was an effect of high rainfall on nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) availability and indexes of C cycling in lowland tropical rain forests exposed to a broad range of mean annual precipitation (MAP). We predicted that C turnover time would increase with MAP while the availability of N and P would decrease. We studied seven Neotropical lowland forests covering a MAP range between 2,700 and 9,500\xc2\xa0mm. We used radiocarbon (\xe2\x88\x8614C) from the atmosphere and respired from soil organic matter to estimate residence time of C in plants and soils. We also used C, N, and P concentrations and the stable isotope ratio of N (\xce\xb415N) in live and dead plant tissues and in soils as proxies for nutrient availability. Negative \xce\xb415N values indicated that the wettest forests had N cycles that did not exhibit isotope-fractionating losses and were potentially N-limited. Element ratios (N:P and C:P) in senescent leaves, litter, and live roots showed that P resorption increased considerably with MAP, which points towards increasing P-limitation under high MAP regimes. Soil C content increased with MAP but C turnover time only showed a weak relationship with MAP, probably due to variations in soil parent material and age along the MAP gradient. In contrast, comparing C turnover directly to nutrient availability showed strong relationships between C turnover time, N availability (\xce\xb415N), and P availability (N:P) in senescent leaves and litter. Thus, an effect of MAP on carbon cycling appeared to be indirectly mediated by nutrient availability. Our results suggest that soil nutrient availability plays a central role in the dynamic of C cycling in tropical rain forests.'

Abstract: 'Previous studies have shown that shade trees in cacao and coffee are important habitats for inter-American migratory birds. A survey of 21 cacao farmers along the northern, central, and southern Pacific Coast of Ecuador found that shade trees are associated with unirrigated, traditional cacao varieties and low levels of chemical inputs. Farmers stressed the importance of shade for managing soil moisture and soil fertility, and for managing some weeds and diseases. Most of the shade trees were not wild forest trees, but had been planted and protected by the farm families. Many other trees are intercropped with cacao for economic reasons, not related to shade. Chocolate manufacturers, consumers, and environmental activists can encourage farmers to maintain shade canopies by paying a premium for the traditional, shade-loving, high-quality aromatic cocoa varieties.'

Abstract: ' Manilkara zapota is a tropical tree species that was used by the ancient Maya in construction of their temples and as a source for fruit. Although this has been supported by ethnographic and paleoethnobotanical data, we used genetic approaches to estimate variation and structure in modern populations of this neotropical tree species to discern if genetic patterns were consistent with earlier influences of ancient Maya management or if they could be explained by the natural history of the species. Nine microsatellite markers, consisting of seven novel markers and two markers identified in a related species, were used to characterize the genetic diversity and population genetic structure in three populations of M. zapota collected from reforested, historically urbanized ancient Maya ceremonial centers in Guatemala and Belize, from home gardens in Guatemala, and from a number of cultivars. Levels of genetic variation were slightly higher in forest populations (H O\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.447) than in gardens (0.430) and cultivated varieties of M. zapota (0.351). We observed low but significant population substructuring (\xce\xb8\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01) between sites 90\xc2\xa0km apart, and minimal evidence of inbreeding. Substantial levels of genetic diversity with minimal genetic structure in M. zapota are consistent with movement of the ancient Maya as they possibly carried fruits and seedlings during immigration, but they may more likely reflect natural processes such as seed and pollen being dispersed widely throughout the tropical forest.'

Abstract: 'Uncertainty about the mechanisms driving biomass change at broad spatial scales limits our ability to predict the response of forest biomass storage to global change. Here we use a spatially representative network of 874 forest plots in New Zealand to examine whether commonly hypothesised drivers of forest biomass and biomass change (diversity, disturbance, nutrients and climate) differ between old-growth and secondary forests at a national scale. We calculate biomass stocks and net biomass change for live above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood and litter pools. We combine these data with plot-level information on forest type, tree diversity, plant functional traits, climate and disturbance history, and use structural equation models to identify the major drivers of biomass change. Over the period 2002\xe2\x80\x932014, secondary forest biomass increased by 2.78 (1.68\xe2\x80\x933.89) Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 y\xe2\x88\x921, whereas no significant change was detected in old-growth forests (+0.28; \xe2\x88\x920.72 to 1.29\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 y\xe2\x88\x921). The drivers of biomass and biomass change differed between secondary and old-growth forests. Plot-level biomass change of old-growth forest was driven by recent disturbance (large tree mortality within the last decade), whereas biomass change of secondary forest was determined by current biomass and past anthropogenic disturbance. Climate indirectly affected biomass change through its relationship with past anthropogenic disturbance. Our results highlight the importance of disturbance and disturbance history in determining broad-scale patterns of forest biomass change and suggest that explicitly modelling processes driving biomass change within secondary and old-growth forests is essential for predicting future changes in global forest biomass.'

Abstract: ' Camponotus femoratus is an abundant and behaviorally dominant ant in lowland Amazonian rainforests, where this species participates in a complex and obligate seed-dispersal mutualism. C. femoratus typically cohabits with another ant species Crematogaster levior in an apparently amiable but poorly understood interaction. Despite these outstanding characteristics, the population genetics and dispersal patterns of C. femoratus are unknown. We isolated eight polymorphic microsatellite loci for C. femoratus from a genomic library enriched for di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats. We detected 2 to 17 alleles per locus, with levels of observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.286 to 0.714.'

Abstract: 'Thrash metal songs have confronted listeners with socio-political problems since the genre emerged in the 1980s. Its abrasive tone and dystopian language implicitly and explicitly attacks norms, religion, the economic and political status quo, and social injustice. In addition to these anthropocentric concerns lives a powerful critique of our problematic contemporary relationship with the more-than-human community. This paper examines implicit and explicit environmental ethical statements in 18 thrash songs released between 1987 and 2013 written by 12 bands. It shows a consistent ecologically dystopian position and critical ethical stance ripe for ecopedagogical and ethics education purposes. Following that, the article explores more specific environmental ethical issues and presents approaches to incorporating them into curricula with possible bridges to other musical genres. It concludes with a call for a deeper critical ethical conversation in the age of ecocide.'

Abstract: 'In order to document benthic foraminiferal and testate amoeba diversity, a total of 115 sediment samples were collected from nine different transitional environments along a 100-km long coastal area located in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). This area is directly affected by both the input of freshwater from the Tramanda\xc3\xad River and a marine influence due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. In particular, 14 and 101 species are recognized within the benthic foraminiferal and testate amoeba assemblages, respectively. Testate amoebae diversity is significantly higher than that documented in previous investigations carried out in other parts of the Brazilian coast. The two dominant testate amoeba families are Difflugidae and Hyalospheniidae, which are represented by 74 and 9 species, respectively. On the other hand, the benthic foraminiferal assemblages are poorly diversified and mainly dominated by agglutinated forms that are typical of transitional environments under the direct influence of a freshwater input. The distribution of these two groups characterizes both the freshwater environments, where testate amoebae are the only representatives, and the more marine conditions, where benthic foraminifera tend to dominate the benthic community, and allows the recognition of a marine influence gradient. The benthic foraminiferal assemblages are mainly observed in front of the direct opening to the sea, but are completely absent in the innermost environments, whereas testate amoebae are more widely distributed, albeit in variable abundances, but are completely missing close to the Tramanda\xc3\xad Basin\xe2\x80\x99s outlet. Although the diversity of the benthic community in South Atlantic coastal regions is difficult to determine, this study represents, to our knowledge, the first investigation of benthic foraminifera and testate amoebae along the 100-km long coastal area, characterized by lagoons and lakes interconnected by canals and small rivers.'

Abstract: 'The very decorative heartwood of Brosimum guianense is internationally well known. Snakewood, as it is colloquially known, is represented in wood databases (e.g. the DELTA or InsideWood) as well as in lists of commercial timbers of many timber trading companies. The very decorative heartwood is hardly available and gains prices of up to 25\xc2\xa0\xe2\x82\xac/kg in form of half stems. In the present study, the chemical composition and especially the subcellular cell structure was analysed by means of UV microspectrophotometry to explain the high natural durability and some extraordinary physical properties in addition to the anatomical composition. The heartwood consists of approximately 39% lignin, 54% carbohydrates and 0.4% lipophilic compounds of unspecified origin. The fibres are very thick-walled. Numerous sclerotic tyloses and organic deposits are present in the vessel. The extractives in high content are also components of parenchyma cells as well as in tyloses, respectively. These detected phenolic extractives, partly of flavonoid character, are also part of the cell wall. Calcium oxalate crystals are deposited in the upright and square cells of rays and sporadically in axial parenchyma cells. These facts are reasons for the famous natural durability of Snakewood. The sapwood density ranges from 1.1 to 1.4\xc2\xa0g/cm3 for heartwood (12% mc). The compression strength (119\xc2\xa0N/mm2), the bending strength (241\xc2\xa0N/mm2), the modulus of elasticity (23,200\xc2\xa0N/mm2) and the hardness (196\xc2\xa0N/mm2) indicate exceedingly high elastomechanical properties.'

Abstract: 'The present study characterised the population genetic structure of Plebeia remota through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis and evaluated evolutionary and ecological processes that may have contributed to the species current genetic scenario. Seventy feral nests were sampled representing four geographic regions (Cunha, Curitiba, Prudent\xc3\xb3polis, and Blumenau). Fifteen composite mtDNA haplotypes were determined and a high genetic structure was detected among all populations. The current population structure may be a result of queen philopatry and vegetation shifts caused by palaeoclimatic changes and uplift of Brazilian coastal ranges. Finally, this study strongly suggests a revision of the taxonomic status of P. remota from the Prudent\xc3\xb3polis region.'

Abstract: 'The societies of southern Central America and northern South America, a region historically occupied by Chibchan-speaking peoples, have long been acknowledged as valuable sources of information on chiefdoms and other forms of prestate social organization. Most studies, however, have focused on chiefdoms that are known ethnographically or ethnohistorically with an emphasis on the sixteenth century and the immediate precontact period. This paper reviews archaeological evidence from an earlier period in an attempt to elucidate general patterns associated with the earliest appearance of social inequality. The centuries between AD 300 and 600 are characterized by the first widespread use of prestige goods manufactured from gold and jade, special cemeteries for the interment of elites, and a rich iconography. Detailed consideration of recent research relevant to the events of this period highlights some of the problems inherent in the archaeological identification of hierarchy, chiefdoms, leadership, and other features of prestate complex societies.'

Abstract: 'Optimism in conservation, and its potential impact on conservation practice, has been the focus of considerable recent attention. Dispositional optimism is the tendency to have positive expectations for the future, and previous research on optimism has focused particularly on the relationship between optimism and positive health outcomes. This research has concluded that optimism is generally a positive trait that can help people address problems, and set and achieve their goals. These characteristics may also be beneficial in conservation contexts. Using the revised Life Orientation Test, we measure dispositional optimism in conservation professionals to assess whether they are more or less optimistic than individuals who do not work in conservation, and whether there are differences in dispositional optimism between conservation professionals. We find that conservation professionals in the UK are more optimistic than a comparator sample of UK residents. Within conservation professionals, we do not find differences in dispositional optimism with age, gender, country of residence, employer, employment status, whether an individual thinks of themselves as a conservation biologist, or years working in conservation. We find weak evidence for lower dispositional optimism in conservation professionals working in Europe, Africa and South America. The most commonly expressed motivation for working in conservation was a feeling of love or connection, but we found no relationship between motivations and dispositional optimism. We did find that conservation professionals with higher dispositional optimism were more likely to be optimistic about the future of conservation, although no more likely to be optimistic about three specific conservation issues. Greater optimism in conservation professionals has important implications for conservation practice\xe2\x80\x94optimists could benefit the success of the projects they work on, and benefit from the resilience that optimism provides, in a difficult sector where success is uncertain.'

Abstract: 'Savannas cover about 300 million hectares of South America. The soils are mainly oxisols and ultisols and their natural fertility is very low with high acidity. The natural vegetation varies in density and in the amount of biomass produced annually, which can be equal to that produced by forests in the region. Among the nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms, the only ones well-studied are Rhizobium bacteria. In managing the biomass in these areas, it is important to consider biological nitrogen-fixation as a possible source of nitrogen to replace that removed in crops. Nitrification and denitrification in these soils are intense but not well studied. The rainfall distribution during the growing season seems to have a considerable influence of the nitrogen supply to the soils. A considerable loss of nitrogen occurs in this environment when vast areas are burned annually.'

Abstract: ' Carbon isotope ratios (\xce\xb413C) were studied in evergreen and deciduous forest ecosystems in semi-arid Utah (Pinus contorta, Populus tremuloides, Acer negundo and Acer grandidentatum). Measurements were taken in four to five stands of each forest ecosystem differing in overstory leaf area index (LAI) during two consecutive growing seasons. The \xce\xb413Cleaf (and carbon isotope discrimination) of understory vegetation in the evergreen stands (LAI 1.5\xe2\x80\x932.2) did not differ among canopies with increasing LAI, whereas understory in the deciduous stands (LAI 1.5\xe2\x80\x934.5) exhibited strongly decreasing \xce\xb413Cleaf values (increasing carbon isotope discrimination) with increasing LAI. The \xce\xb413C values of needles and leaves at the top of the canopy were relatively constant over the entire LAI range, indicating no change in intrinsic water-use efficiency with overstory LAI. In all canopies, \xce\xb413Cleaf decreased with decreasing height above the forest floor, primarily due to physiological changes affecting ci/ca (>\xe2\x80\x8960%) and to a minor extent due to \xce\xb413C of canopy air (<\xe2\x80\x8940%). This intra-canopy depletion of \xce\xb413Cleaf was lowest in the open stand (1\xe2\x80\xb0) and greatest in the denser stands (4.5\xe2\x80\xb0). Although overstory \xce\xb413Cleaf did not change with canopy LAI, \xce\xb413C of soil organic carbon increased with increasing LAI in Pinus contorta and Populus tremuloides ecosystems. In addition, \xce\xb413C of decomposing organic carbon became increasingly enriched over time (by 1.7\xe2\x80\x932.9\xe2\x80\xb0) for all deciduous and evergreen dry temperate forests. The \xce\xb413Ccanopy of CO2 in canopy air varied temporally and spatially in all forest stands. Vertical canopy gradients of \xce\xb413Ccanopy, and [CO2]canopy were larger in the deciduous Populus tremuloides than in the evergreen Pinu contorta stands of similar LAI. In a very wet and cool year, ecosystem discrimination (\xce\x94e) was similar for both deciduous Populus tremulodies (18.0\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.7\xe2\x80\xb0) and evergreen Pinus contorta (18.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.9\xe2\x80\xb0) stands. Gradients of \xce\xb413Ccanopy and [CO2]canopy were larger in denser Acer spp. stands than those in the open stand. However, 13C enrichment above and photosynthetic draw-down of [CO2]canopy below tropospheric baseline values were larger in the open than in the dense stands, due to the presence of a vigorous understory vegetation. Seasonal patterns of the relationship \xce\xb413Ccanopy versus 1/[CO2]canopy were strongly influenced by precipitation and air temperature during the growing season. Estimates of \xce\x94e for Acer spp. did not show a significant effect of stand structure, and averaged 16.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.5\xe2\x80\xb0 in 1933 and 17.4\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.7\xe2\x80\xb0 in 1994. However, \xce\x94e varied seasonally with small fluctuations for the open stand (2\xe2\x80\xb0), but more pronounced changes for the dense stand (5\xe2\x80\xb0).'

Abstract: 'Croplands are highly productive ecosystems that contribute to land\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere exchange of carbon, energy, and water during their short growing seasons. We evaluated and compared net ecosystem exchange (NEE), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) simulated by a suite of ecosystem models at five agricultural eddy covariance flux tower sites in the central United States as part of the North American Carbon Program Site Synthesis project. Most of the models overestimated H and underestimated LE during the growing season, leading to overall higher Bowen ratios compared to the observations. Most models systematically under predicted NEE, especially at rain-fed sites. Certain crop-specific models that were developed considering the high productivity and associated physiological changes in specific crops better predicted the NEE and LE at both rain-fed and irrigated sites. Models with specific parameterization for different crops better simulated the inter-annual variability of NEE for maize-soybean rotation compared to those models with a single generic crop type. Stratification according to basic model formulation and phenological methodology did not explain significant variation in model performance across these sites and crops. The under prediction of NEE and LE and over prediction of H by most of the models suggests that models developed and parameterized for natural ecosystems cannot accurately predict the more robust physiology of highly bred and intensively managed crop ecosystems. When coupled in Earth System Models, it is likely that the excessive physiological stress simulated in many land surface component models leads to overestimation of temperature and atmospheric boundary layer depth, and underestimation of humidity and CO2 seasonal uptake over agricultural regions.'

Abstract: 'One of the most important elements in flood disaster management is the availability of timely information for taking decisions and actions by the authorities. During the August 18, 2008 Kosi floods which impacted India and Nepal and affected more than three million people, aero-space technology proved to be a critical input for providing vital information on flood inundation. The satellite based flood inundation maps were extensively used for identifying marooned villages, submerged roads and railway tracks and carrying out the relief and rescue operations by the state agencies. Decision Support Centre (DSC) at National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) kept a constant watch on the flood situation. More than 200 flood inundation maps, using about 30 satellite datasets were generated and provided in near real time mode to the state agencies during August to October, 2008. DSC efforts were primarily focused in providing an overall picture of the flood situation in a short span of time to the state agencies. The present paper discusses about the operational use of remote sensing technology for near real time flood mapping, monitoring of Kosi floods and the satellite based observations made for the Kosi river breach.'

Abstract: "A computer simulation model was used to derive estimates of the probability of extinction of populations of the endangered species, Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri), inhabiting ensembles of habitat patches within two wood production forest blocks in central Victoria, south-eastern Australia. Data on the habitat patches were extracted from forest inventory information that had been captured in the database of a Geographic Information System (GIS). Our analyses focussed on a range of issues associated with the size, number and spatial configuration of patches of potentially suitable habitat that occur within the Ada and Steavenson Forest Blocks. The sensitivity of extinction risks in these two areas to variations in the movement capability ofG. leadbeateri was also examined."

Abstract: 'The development of methods to produce nanoparticles with unique properties via the aerosol route is progressing rapidly. Typical characterization techniques extract particles from the synthesis process for subsequent offline analysis, which may alter the particle characteristics. In this work, we use laser-vaporization aerosol mass spectrometry (LV-AMS) with 70-eV electron ionization for real-time, in-situ nanoparticle characterization. The particle characteristics are examined for various aerosol synthesis methods, degrees of sintering, and for controlled condensation of organic material to simulate surface coating/functionalization. The LV-AMS is used to characterize several types of metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au, Pd, PdAg, Fe, Ni, and Cu). The degree of oxidation of the Fe and Ni nanoparticles is found to increase with increased sintering temperature, while the surface organic-impurity content of the metal particles decreases with increased sintering temperature. For aggregate metal particles, the organic-impurity content is found to be similar to that of a monolayer. By comparing different equivalent-diameter measurements, we demonstrate that the LV-AMS can be used in tandem with a differential mobility analyzer to determine the compactness of synthesized metal particles, both during sintering and during material addition for surface functionalization. Further, materials supplied to the particle production line downstream of the particle generators are found to reach the generators as contaminants. The capacity for such in-situ observations is important, as it facilitates rapid response to undesired behavior within the particle production process. This study demonstrates the utility of real-time, in-situ aerosol mass spectrometric measurements to characterize metal nanoparticles obtained directly from the synthesis process line, including their chemical composition, shape, and contamination, providing the potential for effective optimization of process operating parameters.'

Abstract: 'Forest-height inversion using airborne double-antenna synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems has been widely researched, leading to increasing accuracy. Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) data from spaceborne single-antenna SAR systems, which are influenced by temporal decorrelation, have difficulty inverting forest height. Given the temporal decorrelation effect, the classical random volume over ground (RVoG) model has been proven to invert forest height with significant errors, using repeat-pass PolInSAR data. In consideration of this problem, the temporal decorrelation RVoG (TD-RVoG; based on the RVoG) model was proposed. In this study, an improved TD-RVoG model is presented, with a new temporal decorrelation function. Compared with TD-RVoG, the new model has fewer unknown parameters and can be applied in a three-stage inversion procedure. Validity of the new model is demonstrated by Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band SAR (ALOS/PALSAR) data. Results show that the improved TD-RVoG has better accuracy, with inversion error less than 1.5 m.'

Abstract: 'Drought-induced vegetation mortality has been documented on every vegetated continent in recent decades and constitutes a major uncertainty in climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and carbon cycle feedbacks. While recent research has focused on specific failure mechanisms during drought-induced forest die-off, a broader understanding of the physiology of trees under drought, especially changes in growth and carbon allocation, is needed for determining the sensitivity of forests to drought and interacting mechanisms during forest mortality. I present here multi-tissue and high-resolution temporal dynamics of tree carbon resources during moderate experimental and natural drought in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests, a major forest type in western North America that recently experienced widespread drought-induced die-off. Drought led to substantial declines in inferred carbon uptake. Tree carbohydrate concentrations, however, largely increased in concert with substantial decreases in growth and severe declines in root biomass. These findings highlight that growth declines, especially in fine roots which are important to water uptake, and increased carbon allocation to root non-structural carbohydrates are key responses to drought in aspen and could play an important role in widespread die-off. They suggest multi-year consequences of drought and carbon-hydraulic interconnections. They underscore the need for a more integrated multi-tissue, multi-process, and multi-year perspective of climate-induced forest mortality.'

Abstract: 'Many developing countries are experiencing rapid ecological changes such as deforestation and shifting agricultural practices. These environmental changes may have an important consequence on malaria due to their impact on vector survival and reproduction. Despite intensive deforestation and malaria transmission in the China-Myanmar border area, the impact of deforestation on malaria vectors in the border area is unknown.'

Abstract: '\nPhysiology and assessment constitute major bottlenecks of school learning among students with low socioeconomic status. The limited resources and household overcrowding typical of poverty produce deficits in nutrition, sleep, and exercise that strongly hinder physiology and hence learning. Likewise, overcrowded classrooms hamper the assessment of individual learning with enough temporal resolution to make individual interventions effective. Computational measurements of learning offer hope for low-cost, fast, scalable, and yet personalized academic evaluation. Improvement of school schedules by reducing lecture time in favor of naps, exercise, meals, and frequent automated assessments of individual performance is an easily achievable goal for education.\n'

Abstract: ' Aulacothrips Hood, 1952 is a remarkable South American genus of ectoparasitic thrips which feed on gregarious ant-tended hemipterans (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha). Here we describe two new species of this genus infesting membracid treehoppers in Colombia and Brazilian Amazon, and provide a key to the five Aulacothrips spp. now recognised. Aulacothrips levinotus n. sp. is unique in having pronotum with only two pairs of major setae; and Aulacothrips tenuis n. sp. has unusually long abdominal tergite IX. These findings will be helpful for understanding the species diversification in this genus, bringing a new perspective on the diversity of Aulacothrips spp. and their myrmecophilous hemipteran hosts.'

Abstract: 'Allochthonous inputs of detritus represent an important energy source for streams in forested regions, but dynamics of these materials are not well studied in neotropical headwater streams. As part of the tropical amphibian declines in streams (TADS) project, we quantified benthic organic matter standing stocks and organic seston dynamics in four Panamanian headwater streams, two with (pre-amphibian decline) and two without (post-decline) healthy amphibian assemblages. We also measured direct litterfall and lateral litter inputs in two of these streams. Continuous litterfall and monthly benthic samples were collected for 1\xc2\xa0year, and seston was collected 1\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0times/month for 1\xc2\xa0year at or near baseflow. Direct litterfall was similar between the two streams examined, ranging from 934\xe2\x80\x931,137\xc2\xa0g DM m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921. Lateral inputs were lower, ranging from 140\xe2\x80\x93187\xc2\xa0g DM m\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921. Dead leaves (57\xe2\x80\x9360%), wood (24\xe2\x80\x9329%), and green leaves (8\xe2\x80\x939%) contributed most to inputs, and total inputs were generally higher during the rainy season. Annual habitat-weighted benthic organic matter standing stocks ranged from 101\xe2\x80\x93171\xc2\xa0g AFDM m\xe2\x88\x922 across the four study reaches, with \xe2\x88\xbc4\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0higher values in pools compared to erosional habitats. Total benthic organic matter (BOM) values did not change appreciably with season, but coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, >1\xc2\xa0mm) generally decreased and very fine particulate organic matter (VFPOM, 1.6\xe2\x80\x93250\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm) generally increased during the dry season. Average annual seston concentrations ranged from 0.2\xe2\x80\x930.6\xc2\xa0mg AFDM l\xe2\x88\x921 (fine seston, <754\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm >250\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm) and 2.0\xe2\x80\x934.7\xc2\xa0mg AFDM l\xe2\x88\x921 (very fine, <250\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm >1.6\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm), with very fine particles composing 85\xe2\x80\x9392% of total seston. Quality of fine seston particles in the two reaches where tadpoles were present was significantly higher (lower C/N) than the two where tadpoles had been severely reduced (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.0028), suggesting that ongoing amphibian declines in this region are negatively influencing the quality of particles exported from headwaters. Compared to forested streams in other regions, these systems receive relatively high amounts of allochthonous litter inputs but have low in-stream storage.'

Abstract: 'Recent developments of 30 m global land characterization datasets (e.g., land cover, vegetation continues field) represent the finest spatial resolution inputs for global scale studies. Here, we present results from further improvement to land cover mapping and impact analysis of spatial resolution on area estimation for different land cover types. We proposed a set of methods to aggregate two existing 30 m resolution circa 2010 global land cover maps, namely FROM-GLC (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring-Global Land Cover) and FROM-GLC-seg (Segmentation), with two coarser resolution global maps on development, i.e., Nighttime Light Impervious Surface Area (NL-ISA) and MODIS urban extent (MODIS-urban), to produce an improved 30 m global land cover map\xe2\x80\x94FROM-GLC-agg (Aggregation). It was post-processed using additional coarse resolution datasets (i.e., MCD12Q1, GlobCover2009, MOD44W etc.) to reduce land cover type confusion. Around 98.9% pixels remain 30 m resolution after some post-processing to this dataset. Based on this map, majority aggregation and proportion aggregation approaches were employed to create a multi-resolution hierarchy (i.e., 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, 5 km, 10 km, 25 km, 50 km, 100 km) of land cover maps to meet requirements for different resolutions from different applications. Through accuracy assessment, we found that the best overall accuracies for the post-processed base map (at 30 m) and the three maps subsequently aggregated at 250 m, 500 m, 1 km resolutions are 69.50%, 76.65%, 74.65%, and 73.47%, respectively. Our analysis of area-estimation biases for different land cover types at different resolutions suggests that maps at coarser than 5 km resolution contain at least 5% area estimation error for most land cover types. Proportion layers, which contain precise information on land cover percentage, are suggested for use when coarser resolution land cover data are required.'

Abstract: "The warm, seasonally dry climate of Mexico's south coast is represented by data from the biological station at Chamela, Jalisco, and is compared with 26 other localities. The mean annual temperature was 24.9 \xc2\xb0C; monthly mean maximums were equitable (29.1\xc2\xb0 to 32.0\xc2\xb0) but minimums showed significant seasonal changes (14.8\xc2\xb0 to 22.9\xc2\xb0). Local winds were strongest in the late dry season. Most cyclonic features moved parallel to the coast. Hurricanes made landfall much more frequently along some parts of the coast than others. The average annual precipitation was 748 mm, with a coefficient of variation of 16% for eight years. Rainfall was measurable on an average of 53 days per year, but the seven heaviest rains contributed over 50%.of the total; 80% of the total fell between 2 July and 4 November. Occasionally, there was substantial rain in December or January. For unsheltered lowland localities, rainfall increased with elevation, as did length of the wet season. Longer-term records (40 and more years) from four localities showed significant oscillations in precipitation that were correlated between sites."

Abstract: 'Determining how tropical tree populations subject to selective felling (logging) pressure may be conserved is a crucial issue for forest management and studying this issue requires a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between population demography and gene flow. We used a simulation model, SELVA, to study (1) the relative impact of demographic factors (juvenile mortality, felling regime) and genetic factors (selfing, number and location of fathers, mating success) on long-term genetic diversity; and (2) the impact of different felling regimes on population size versus genetic diversity. Impact was measured by means of model sensitivity analyses. Juvenile mortality had the highest impact on the number of alleles and genotypes, and on the genetic distance between the original and final populations. Selfing had the greatest impact on observed heterozygote frequency and fixation index. Other factors and interactions had only minor effects. Overall, felling had a greater impact on population size than on genetic diversity. Interestingly, populations under relatively low felling pressure even had a somewhat lower fixation index than undisturbed populations (no felling). We conclude that demographic processes such as juvenile mortality should be modelled thoroughly to obtain reliable long-term predictions of genetic diversity. Mortality in selfed and outcrossed progenies should be modelled explicitly by taking inbreeding depression into account. The modelling of selfing based on population rate appeared to be oversimplifying and should account for inter-tree variation. Forest management should pay particular attention to the regeneration capacities of felled species.'

Abstract: 'The regional climate model (RegCM4) is customized for 10-year climate simulation over Indian region through sensitivity studies on cumulus convection and land surface parameterization schemes. The model is configured over 30\xc2\xb0 E\xe2\x80\x93120\xc2\xb0 E and 15\xc2\xb0 S\xe2\x80\x9345\xc2\xb0 N at 30-km horizontal resolution with 23 vertical levels. Six 10-year (1991\xe2\x80\x932000) simulations are conducted with the combinations of two land surface schemes (BATS, CLM3.5) and three cumulus convection schemes (Kuo, Grell, MIT). The simulated annual and seasonal climatology of surface temperature and precipitation are compared with CRU observations. The interannual variability of these two parameters is also analyzed. The results indicate that the model simulated climatology is sensitive to the convection as well as land surface parameterization. The analysis of surface temperature (precipitation) climatology indicates that the model with CLM produces warmer (dryer) climatology, particularly over India. The warmer (dryer) climatology is due to the higher sensible heat flux (lower evapotranspiration) in CLM. The model with MIT convection scheme simulated wetter and warmer climatology (higher precipitation and temperature) with smaller Bowen ratio over southern India compared to that with the Grell and Kuo schemes. This indicates that a land surface scheme produces warmer but drier climatology with sensible heating contributing to warming where as a convection scheme warmer but wetter climatology with latent heat contributing to warming. The climatology of surface temperature over India is better simulated by the model with BATS land surface model in combination with MIT convection scheme while the precipitation climatology is better simulated with BATS land surface model in combination with Grell convection scheme. Overall, the modeling system with the combination of Grell convection and BATS land surface scheme provides better climate simulation over the Indian region.'

Abstract: 'Most of Latin America will be hard hit by climate change, particularly with respect to water resources, but countries have adopted differing approaches, both in terms of their domestic responses and international engagement. The Region\xe2\x80\x99s variance in history, governance strategies, and sectoral dependence has meant that its countries have played both blocking and facilitating roles in international climate negotiations. As such, Edwards and Roberts (2015) make the argument that Latin America\xe2\x80\x99s role in global climate change governance is \xe2\x80\x9ccentral,\xe2\x80\x9d and often undervalued (p. 36). Many Latin American and Caribbean countries are already experiencing changes in their climate and water resources, and future impacts are expected to be even more severe.'

Abstract: 'During the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15), Parties agreed that reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing \xe2\x80\x98removals of greenhouse gas emission by forests\xe2\x80\x99 (REDD+) in developing countries through positive incentives under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was capable of dealing with global emissions. As REDD+ seeks to lower emissions by stopping deforestation and forest degradation with an international payment tier according to baseline scenarios, opportunities for ecosystem benefits such as slowing habitat fragmentation, conservation of forest biodiversity, soil conservation may be also part of this effort. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate ecosystem-based benefits of REDD+, and to identify the relationships with carbon stock changes. To achieve this goal, high resolution satellite images are combined with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify historical deforestation in study area of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The carbon emissions for the period of 2000\xe2\x80\x932005 and 2005\xe2\x80\x932009 are 2.73 \xc3\x97 105 t CO2 and 1.47 \xc3\x97 106 t CO2 respectively, showing an increasing trend in recent years. Dring 2005\xe2\x80\x932009, number of patches (NP), patch density (PD), mean shape index distribution (SHAPE_MN) increased 30.8%, 30.7% and 7.6%. Meanwhile, largest patch index (LPI), mean area (AREA_MN), area-weighted mean of shape index distribution (SHAPE_AM), neighbor distance (ENN_MN) and interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI) decreased by 55.3%, 29.7%, 15.8%, 53.4% and 21.5% respectively. The area regarding as positive correlation between carbon emissions and soil erosion was approximately 8.9 \xc3\x97 103 ha corresponding to 96.0% of the changing forest. These results support the view that there are strong synergies among carbon loss, forest fragmentation and soil erosion in tropical forests. Such mechanism of REDD+ is likely to present opportunities for multiple benefits that fall outside the scope of carbon stocks.'

Abstract: 'Forest logging in the Congo Basin has led to forest fragmentation due to logging infrastructures and felling gaps. In the same vein, forest concessions in the Congo Basin have increasing interest in the REDD+ mechanism. However, there is little information or field data on carbon emissions from forest degradation caused by logging. To help fill this gap, Landsat 7 and 8 and SPOT 4 images of the East Region of Cameroon were processed and combined with field measurements (measurement of forest roads widths, felling gaps and log yards) to assess all disturbed areas. Also, measurements of different types of forest infrastructures helped to highlight emission factors. Forest contributes to 5.18\xc2\xa0% of the degradation of the annual allowable cut (AAC) (84.53\xc2\xa0ha) corresponding to 4.09\xc2\xa0% of forest carbon stock (6.92 t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). Felling gaps constitute the primary source of degradation, represented an estimated area of 32.41\xc2\xa0ha (2\xc2\xa0% of the cutting area) far ahead of primary roads (18.44\xc2\xa0ha) and skid trails (16.36\xc2\xa0ha). Assessment of the impact of degradation under the canopy requires the use of high resolution satellite images and field surveys.'

Abstract: 'The results of WRF-CHEM model simulation of dispersal of anthropogenic emissions from the Norilsk industrial zone are verified against data of aircraft sensing performed in August 2004. It is shown that the WRF-CHEM v3.5.1 model configuration selected adequately reproduces the meteorological parameters obtained during the 2004 measurement campaign. The model-derived distributions of the concentrations of sulfur anhydride and ozone and mass concentration of aerosol qualitatively reproduce those retrieved from data of aircraft sensing. Quantitative estimates showed that the standard errors for sulfur dioxide, PM2.5 mass concentration, and ozone, calculated for three flights, had been 23 ppb, 2.6 \xce\xbcg/m3, and 9.8 ppb, respectively. These discrepancies may be due to incorrect specification of the initial and boundary conditions, inaccurate specification of anthropogenic emissions, and limitations in the aerosol and chemical descriptions.'

Abstract: 'Knowledge of how energy budget components vary with time, vegetation type and stage of development and field size is important if we are to increase our understanding of the energy budget on a regional scale. The aim of this study was to quantify the seasonal and diurnal variation of energy budget components of a 2.6 ha short-rotation stand. Measurements were made using a thermometer interchange system for gradient and Bowen ratio estimations. Energy storage in soil, air and biomass was determined from temperature and humidity measurements. The partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes changed drastically at the beginning of the season. From the first half of May until the second half of June the maximum (noon) latent heat flux increased by a factor of 3, the total storage decreased by a factor of 2 and the sensible heat flux decreased by a factor of 4.5, while net radiation was unchanged. The vapour pressure deficit was similar during these periods but the leaf area index increased from about zero to three. On a mean monthly basis, the sensible heat flux was negative (directed towards the surface) from June to October, i.e., during most of the season. Heat was supplied to the atmosphere only at the beginning of the season for this type of short-rotation stand. Heat storage in air and biomass was significant on an hourly basis, especially in mornings and evenings when it could be of the same order as the net radiation. It was concluded that the development stage of the short-rotation stand had a large influence on how the energy was distributed between the convective fluxes. It was also concluded that storage in air and biomass had to be accounted for if precise estimates of energy balance on a shorter (hourly) time scale were required.'

Abstract: 'The economically important gymnosperm Gnetum L. is distributed in humid tropical forests of Africa. Its leaves are used as commercialized vegetables and greatly alleviate poverty for local people. Previously, the number of species recognized in Africa was uncertain, and Gnetum africanum Welw. and G. buchholzianum Engl. had been variously, and erroneously, applied to specimens. Based on recent morphological studies, species limits were clarified and two new African species, Gnetum interruptum E.H.Biye and G. latispicum E.H.Biye, were described. The purpose of this study was to determine species limits, to investigate potential infraspecific variation in wild African Gnetum species and to determine which features distinguish them in order to assess the validity of four species recognized by Biye et al. (Pl Syst Evol 300(2):263\xe2\x80\x93272, 2014). Sixty-seven morphological characters were scored for a total of 175 (56 male and 119 female) specimens and analysed using cluster, principal components and principal coordinates analyses. Four distinct clusters of Gnetum specimens were recognized that correspond to the species now described as G. africanum, G. buchholzianum, G. interuptum and G. latispicum. A lack of geographical correlation with subclusters as well as their structure suggests there is no justification for recognizing infraspecific taxa. Characters that describe features of the spikes should be used to differentiate between and identify the species in Africa. In view of the high levels of utilization of two species and rarity of a third, it is urgent to assess the threat status of Gnetum species in Africa and to design appropriate conservation strategies to conserve these economically valuable plants.'

Abstract: 'The plant water consumption and irrigation management are the core issue of the sustainable growing of the Tarim Desert Highway shelterbelt in the hyperaride Taklimakan Desert. The stem sap flow, water status and water consumption of shelterbelt plants were studied, then, the issue of the water save in the process of shelterbelt irrigation management was discussed by measuring the sap flow of shelterbelt plants with a stem sap flow gauge. The stem sap flow exhibited a distinct diurnal course with maximum values between 10:00 and 15:00, and minimum values between 00:00 and 03:00. Generally, sap flow was lower at night than during the day. The daily average stem sap flow of Calligonum arborescens, Tamarix ramosissima and Haloxylon ammodendron (diameter 1.9\xe2\x80\x932.0 cm) was 67.2 g\xc2\xb7h\xe2\x88\x921, 77.05 g\xc2\xb7h\xe2\x88\x921 and 61.54 g\xc2\xb7h\xe2\x88\x921 respectively. The sap flow was influenced by environmental factors, and the solar radiation, wind velocity, temperature and relative humidity were significantly correlative with plant stem sap flow. The annual water consumption of 8-a Calligonum arborescens, Tamarix ramosissima and Haloxylon ammodendron was 1937.80 kg, 1253.39 kg and 1026.96 kg, while daily average water consumption was 9.69 kg, 6.27 kg and 5.13 kg respectively. Under drip irrigation, soil moisture content of the shelterbelt in different months indicated no obvious fluctuation, and soil moisture was adequate. The predawn and midday plant water potential reflected that the plant water status was in good conditions. There is still some water-saving space if optimizing the present water management, integrating water resources conservation and protection performance.'

Abstract: 'Rainfall interception is an important part of the urban hydrological cycle. Understanding is limited about the role of urban trees and other vegetation in the interception process. This study quantified interception losses by six trees in the Caribbean coastal city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, three representing a broadleaf evergreen, and three representing a broadleaf deciduous species. Rainfall was partitioned into throughfall for 13 storms to compare the results between tree types. Total rainfall ranged from 2.9 to 72.4\xc2\xa0mm, and storm duration spanned 1\xc2\xa0h to several days. Six of the storms analyzed were characterized by maximum hourly intensity rainfall rates categorized as heavy (> 7.6\xc2\xa0mm/h). Strong northeasterly winds brought rain in sustained gusts up to 35\xc2\xa0km/h. Average interception losses totaled 19.7% for both tree types, 22.7% for the deciduous trees, and 16.7% for the evergreen trees. Throughfall exceeded 90% of total rainfall for each of the six trees on one or more occasions, and heavy intensity storms produced negative interception losses in one individual. The effect of tree type on interception was significant for storms of low and moderate intensity, but not heavy intensity. Differences in interception losses between storms of similar intensity and between the two tree types were influenced by leaf area and wind. Results suggest that individual urban tree canopies function as spatio-temporally dynamic storage reservoirs whose interception capacity can vary as micro-meteorological conditions change. These findings help advance understanding about interception processes in humid tropical urban settings.'

Abstract: 'This paper develops principles for responding to climate change from the perspective of John Rawls\xe2\x80\x99 writings on justice. Rawls (1971) argues that principles of justice, in particular those for assigning basic rights and duties of social cooperation, should be selected from an \xe2\x80\x9coriginal position\xe2\x80\x9d as though by (imaginary) agents who do not know their position in society. This paper adapts Rawls\xe2\x80\x99 notion of original position and applies it to the international context required to address climate change. From this perspective it is argued the agents would endorse the current consensus not to allow global warming to exceed 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. They would also find that rich industrial countries, having contributed disproportionately to the causes of climate change, should reduce their emissions faster than developing countries and they should help developing countries to adopt non-carbon energy sources, to adapt to climate change, and to recover from its harms. The paper proposes new institutions needed to carry out these obligations efficiently and effectively.'

Abstract: 'We examined the ability of stingless bees to recruit nest mates to a food source (i) in group foraging species laying pheromone trails from the food to the nest (Trigona recursa Smith, T. hypogea Silvestri, Scaptotrigona depilis Moure), (ii) in solitary foraging species with possible but still doubtful communication of food location inside the nest (Melipona seminigra Friese, M. favosa orbignyi Gu\xc3\xa9rin), and (iii) in species with a less precise (Nannotrigona testaceicornis Lep., Tetragona clavipes Fab.) or no communication (Frieseomelitta varia Lep.). The bees were allowed to collect food (sugar solution or liver in the necrophageous species) ad libitum and the forager number to accumulate, as it would do under normal unrestrained conditions. The median number of bees collecting differed considerably among the species (1.0\xe2\x80\x931436.5). It was highest in the species employing scent trails. The time course of recruitment was characteristic for most of the species and largely independent of the number of foragers involved. The two Melipona species recruited other bees significantly faster than T. recursa, S. depilis, and N. testaceicornis during the first 10 to 30 minutes of an experiment. In species laying a scent trail to guide nestmates to a food source the first recruits appeared with a delay of several minutes followed by a quick increase in forager number. The median time required to recruit all foragers available differed among the species between 95.0 and 240.0 min. These differences can at least partly be explained by differences in the recruitment mechanisms and do not simply follow from differences in colony biomass.'

Abstract: 'The wildlife of the Brazilian Cerrado is threatened by large-scale habitat loss, in particular due to conversion to agricultural land. It is essential to study how the mammal fauna copes with the highly fragmented, human-influenced, non-protected landscape. The paper presents the results of a survey of the large to medium-sized mammals of a typical cattle ranch with a mixture of human-created and natural vegetation types. We recorded 18 species. Surprisingly, several species were found to still thrive in the area, however, many species are rare or have become extinct. We conclude the paper with comments relevant for the conservation of mammals in the Cerrado as a whole.'

Abstract: 'The main purpose of this study was to explore the dynamic changes of greenhouse gas (GHG) from grasslands under different degradation levels during the growing seasons of Inner Mongolia, China. Grassland degradation is associated with the dynamics of GHG fluxes, e.g., CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes. As one of the global ecological environmental problems, grassland degradation has changed the vegetation productivity as well as the accumulation and decomposition rates of soil organic matter and thus will influence the carbon and nitrogen cycles of ecosystems, which will affect the GHG fluxes between grassland ecosystems and the atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to explore how the exchanges of CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes between soil and atmosphere are influenced by the grassland degradation. We measured the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O in lightly degraded, moderately degraded and severely degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia of China during the growing seasons from July to September in 2013 and 2014. The typical semi-arid grassland of Inner Mongolia plays a role as the source of atmospheric CO2 and N2O and the sink for CH4. Compared with CO2 fluxes, N2O and CH4 fluxes were relatively low. The exchange of CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes between the grassland soil and the atmosphere may exclusively depend on the net exchange rate of CO2 in semi-arid grasslands. The greenhouse gases showed a clear seasonal pattern, with the CO2 fluxes of \xe2\x80\x9333.63 \xe2\x80\x93386.36 mg/(m\xe2\x80\xa2h), CH4 uptake fluxes of 0.113\xe2\x80\x930.023 mg/(m\xe2\x80\xa2h) and N2O fluxes of \xe2\x80\x931.68 \xe2\x80\x9319.90 \xce\xbcg/(m\xe2\x80\xa2h). Grassland degradation significantly influenced CH4 uptake but had no significant influence on CO2 and N2O emissions. Soil moisture and temperature were positively correlated with CO2 emissions but had no significant effect on N2O fluxes. Soil moisture may be the primary driving factor for CH4 uptake. The research results can be in help to better understand the impact of grassland degradation on the ecological environment.'

Abstract: 'Allometric models for dominant shade tree species and coffee plants (Coffea arabica) were developed for coffee agroforestry systems in Matagalpa, Nicaragua. The studied shade tree species were Cordia alliodora, Juglans olanchana, Inga tonduzzi and I. punctata. The models predict aboveground biomass based on diameter at breast height (for trees), and the stem diameter at a height of 15\xc2\xa0cm and plant height (for coffee plants). In addition, the specific gravity of the studied species was determined.'

Abstract: 'Spider monkeys (Ateles spp.) are well known for their highly arboreal lifestyle, spending much of their time in the highest levels of the canopy and rarely venturing to the ground. To investigate terrestriality by Ateles and to illuminate the conditions under which spider monkeys venture to the ground, we analyzed ad libitum data from 5 study sites, covering 2 species and 5 subspecies. Three of the sites are in Central/North America: Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama (Ateles geoffroyi panamensis), Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica (A. g. frontatus), and Punta Laguna, Mexico (A. g. yucatanensis). The 2 remaining sites are in South America: Cocha Cashu Biological Station, Per\xc3\xba (A. belzebuth chamek) and Yasuni National Park, Ecuador (A. b. belzebuth). Terrestrialism by Ateles at all sites is rare; however, it is more restricted at the 2 South American sites. In South America, ground use only occurred in the contexts of eating soil or rotten wood and visiting salt licks. In contrast at the 3 sites with Ateles geoffroyi it rarely occurred in a feeding context, but instead more frequently while drinking from streams during the dry season, by adult females escaping attack by adult males, and as part of a chase game. In addition, on BCI adult males were on the ground before attacking adult females. We discuss potential explanations, e.g., climate, species differences, predation pressure, for the differences between the Central/North and South American observations.'

Abstract: 'According to robust versions of virtue epistemology, the reason why knowledge is incompatible with certain kinds of luck is that justified true beliefs must be achieved by the agent (Sosa in A virtue epistemology: apt belief and reflective knowledge, 2007, Reflective knowledge: apt belief and reflective knowledge, 2009, Knowing full well, 2011; Greco in Philos Studies 17:57\xe2\x80\x9369, 2007, Achieving knowledge, 2010, Philos Phenomenol Res 85:1\xe2\x80\x9326, 2012).

Abstract: 'Different aspects of human activities can cause environmental change that endanger species persistence, alter species distributions, and lead to changes in antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, whereas deforestation and flooding of riparian forest results in landscapes consisting of patchily distributed riparian forest fragments in a matrix of pastures, plantations, and urban areas. Therefore, we assessed the richness, abundance, and trophic interactions of trap-nesting Hymenoptera and their parasites at four patches of restored riparian forest and at one reference natural fragment, of different sizes and ages, located at the Volta Grande Reservoir, in Minas Gerais and S\xc3\xa3o Paulo states to answer the following questions: (1) Does the richness and abundance of cavity-nesting bees and wasps differ in riparian forest fragments according to the seasonal periods? (2) Does the composition of cavity-nesting bees and wasps vary among restoration and reference sites and between climate seasons (wet and dry)? (3) How do the degrees of specialization of the parasites vary among the patches of forest? We recorded 12 species of wasps, eight of bees, and nine species of parasites. Areas with longer time since restoration (reference site) showed higher species richness. However, the abundance was higher in most recent areas. The composition of bee and wasp assembly has not significantly changed between the climate seasons, although it is different between sampling areas. The richness and abundance were higher in warmer and rainy periods. The rate of bee and wasp mortality was high. The degree of specialization of parasites varies among sampling units, and the network of host-parasite interaction has a modular configuration with generalists and specialists. We concluded that the restored areas with more complex habitat could provide better conditions for the reestablishment of ecological interactions among these insects, the local flora, and other invertebrates, which together contribute to the success of the restored environments.'

Abstract: 'The Hill Forests in Bangladesh have been depleted and degraded in volume, area, and quantity, thus requiring urgent forest protection by identifying the causes of forest loss. This study seeks to identify the fundamental causes of the shrinking forest cover in the Hill Forests in Bangladesh. The results indicate four sets of causes: (i) indigenous forest dwellers, having their own types of problems; (ii) migrants, who, because of problems in their places of origin, have decided to move to the forests; (iii) the timber industry, which, legal or not, are cutting too many trees; and (iv) the government through its Forest Department which is not able or willing to implement suitable policies to regulate the cutting trees and to prevent illegal cutting. Because it is a time consuming task to mitigate the first and second sets of factors, we recommend to involve forest dwellers in forestry practices as much as possible and taking necessary steps to alleviate the third and fourth sets and thereby reduce the rate of forest depletion. Accordingly, a number of strategies that should be adopted to halt the loss of remaining forest cover are discussed.'

Abstract: 'This review draws attention to information from the literature and our own observations supporting the view that higher plants and micro-organisms display an intrinsic capacity to be proactively involved in pedogenetic processes. \xe2\x80\x98Bioengineering\xe2\x80\x99 of this kind is deemed to be spearheaded by principal deep-rooted tree and shrub species and to result in optimisation of command and conservation of water and nutrients within an ecosystem. Specific examples discussed in the paper include, the formation of silicon- or iron-based linings of vertical channels and pores, binding of sand on roots, generation of organically derived hydrophobicity, development of clay-based hardpans and texture-contrast seals, precipitation of silcrete, calcrete and ferricrete pavements, effective accessing and conservation of P resources, including mining by microbes and the biological cycling of Si and Al via plants and micro-organisms. In each case, definitive roles and mechanisms are suggested for the organisms involved, particularly in relation to formative effects relating to secretion of organic acids, dispersing agents and other classes of exudate. We introduce the term \xe2\x80\x98phytotarium\xe2\x80\x99 to connote the collective outcomes of the above biotic influences in construction and maintenance of niches peculiar to specific vegetation types and then review the evidence of imprinting of soil profiles due to operation of phytotaria. Examples given relate to the lateral and vertical facies encountered in certain contemporary soil profiles and paleosols with which we are familiar and are described in a companion paper.'

Abstract: 'The aim of this study was to close the carbon budget and reduce uncertainty in annual C balances for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests in The Netherlands. This was done by comparing estimates of the Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) as assessed by two different methods. The inventory based carbon budgeting method estimated the average NEE for 1997 \xe2\x80\x93 2001 at 202 g C m\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921 (a sink) with a confidence interval of 138 \xe2\x80\x93 271 g C m\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921. The estimate obtained by the eddy covariance method was 295 g C m\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921 on average for the same period, with a confidence interval of 224 \xe2\x80\x93 366 g C m\xe2\x88\x922 yr\xe2\x88\x921. Uncertainties in the eddy covariance method were mostly related to gap filling of the data. Main uncertainties in the inventory-based method are related to the soil and the root compartment. The difference in NEE as obtained by two independent methods indicates that it is not straightforward to design a sound National System for monitoring and reporting of the total land area and for accounting of changes in forest area under the Kyoto Protocol, and that more effort is required in this field.'

Abstract: 'Slash and burn conversion of tropical deciduous forest can result in significant disruption of soil nutrient cycling, particularly in terms of the dynamics of microbial populations. This study deals with the effect of fire and ash input on microbial respiration and on distribution of C within water-stable aggregate in soils during a long-term incubation experiment (164 days). In 0\xe2\x80\x932 cm samples, the forest soil with ash had the lowest total CO2-C evolved during incubation. In the top 2 cm soil burned samples, grass amendment did not increase respiration; it did increase respiration, however, in the undisturbed forest soil. Our results suggest that the fire affected microbial activity through both soil heating and chemical changes. As indicated by the results of the grass amendment to burned sample treatment the high temperature killed some soil microorganisms, mainly those associated with the use of newly added C. In addition, ash input appears to have constrained microbial activity through changes in soil chemistry.'

Abstract: ' We examined changes in the intensity of non-ant defenses of three myrmecophytic Macaranga species before and after the initiation of symbiosis with ants in a Bornean dipterocarp forest. The intensities of non-ant defenses at different growth stages of each Macaranga species were estimated by measuring the survival rate of larvae of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura, when the larvae were fed on fresh leaves from seedlings (saplings) at three growth stages of each Macaranga species. In all species, the intensity of the non-ant defenses when seedlings had not yet received symbiont foundress queens was significantly higher than that after ant defense was well established. These results support the hypothesis that myrmecophytic Macaranga may defend themselves sufficiently via non-ant defenses before beginning symbiosis with ants and that the intensity of non-ant defenses may decrease as the symbiont colony size increases. We suggest that, where the status of myrmecophytism changes as plant\xe2\x80\x93ant colonies grow, the decrease in the intensity of non-ant defenses which we detected after the establishment of ant colonies might generate an optimal allocation of metabolic cost to ant and non-ant defenses under resource limitations. We also measured leaf toughness, which is considered to be one of the most important agents of non-ant defenses against herbivorous insects, at different plant stages to assess its contribution to the change in the intensity of non-ant defenses after ant colonization. However, we found no evidence that changes in leaf toughness have a significant effect on the change in balance of the two antiherbivory mechanisms.'

Abstract: 'Human niche construction is not the first theory that makes an attempt to analyze and describe interactions between human interventions and landscape changes. The concept of human niche construction (HNC) (Kendal et al. 2011) shares much with a concept like landesque capital (LC)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cany investment in land with an anticipated life well beyond that of the present crop, or crop cycle\xe2\x80\x9d as proposed by Brookfield (1984; Blaikie and Brookfield 1987). HNC includes phenotypic changes within humans themselves, something LC does not entail. Relevant for our discussion, however, is the assessment that both HNC and LC view the built environment as a cumulative process. More often than not, previous landscapes are repurposed and engineered to accommodate a newly modified land and water scape capable of increased agricultural cropping potential. In this paper, we will discuss how the concept of landscape change\xe2\x80\x94either through HNC or LC\xe2\x80\x94is useful when evaluating and comparing tropical civilizations\xe2\x80\x94like the Maya\xe2\x80\x94and arid environments associated with the rising early states in the Old World\xe2\x80\x94or even the ancestral Puebloans of North America. Although the range of ecological settings both in the New World and the Old World are similar given the scale of continents (contra Watson 2011), the manner by which those landscapes were settled and engineered can be contrasted both between and within hemispheres. Although portions of South and Southeast Asia (rice and rice and yams, respectively) and most of Amazonia and much of Mesoamerica (manioc and related root crops\xe2\x80\x94in addition to maize) are identified with wetland reclamation and comparable levels of social complexity (Scarborough 2003a, 2007), the Near East has set the agenda for assessing highly engineered landscapes as a consequence of large regional surveys that have strongly shaped our general understanding of past landscape evolution (Adams 1955, 1981; Adams and Nissen 1972; Wilkinson 2003). Most scholarly attention devoted to broad sweeps of ancient regional settlement has emphasized the canalization and irrigation developments of the Near East (cereals), the valleys leading from the Andean Cordillera (more cereals) or the diminutive but perennial drainages of central and southern Arizona state (USA\xe2\x80\x94maize, beans and squash), with these semiarid settings accommodating complex trajectories sometimes resulting in the early state. The thrust for this presentation is to assess differences between societal development in arid and wet environments hinging on the apparent influence of dissimilar climatic patterns between regions of the world, and the associated processes by which societies alter environments to accommodate their (pre)historic trajectories.'

Abstract: 'Seedlings of Inga oerstediana Benth. (Mimosaceae) growing in three different light environments (the understory, tree-fall gaps and full sun) were tested for differences in chemistry (nutrients and tannins), wound-induced increases in tannins, growth, and susceptibility to leaf-cutter ants, Atta cephalotes (L.) (Formicidae: Attini). I hypothesized that seedlings of I. oerstediana would contain higher concentrations of tannins when growing in high light conditions and, therefore, would be less susceptible to leaf-cutter ants.'

Abstract: 'Two semi-cultivated Solanum species (S. Sessilifloram Dunal and S. stramonifolium Jacq.) are utilized by the Amazonian Indians of the Upper Orinoco Basin in Venezuela. The manner in which they have become partially domesticated by the Piaroas and other native tribes of this rain forest region is elucidated in the following text. Both species have two varieties, with and without prickles, the latter being the result of human selection. Patterns of indigenous utilization of these species brought to the selection of morphologic forms and to the differentiation of karyotypes of varieties, and exploitation of the species also reflects in the perception of them among users. S. sessiliflorum is cultivated in swiddens and has an economic role, whereas S. stramonifolium is grown in dooryards. This difference is detectable to the Piaroas, as they recognize in their folk taxonomy three different varieties ofS. Sessiliflorum and one ofS. Stramonifolium, according to the stage of domestication of the species and the way in which they are utilized.'

Abstract: 'Aboveground plant biomass was examined in a tall virgin tropical lowland evergreen rain forest dominated by Dipterocarpaceae in Sebulu, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, with special reference to the gap-, building- and mature phases of the forest growth cycle. From the records of dimensions of sample trees examined by the stratified clip technique and DBH inventory data of trees in a study plot, the biomass of larger trees (DBH \xe2\x89\xa54.5 cm) was estimated by the allometric correlation method. The biomass of smaller plants (DBH < 4.5 cm) was estimated by harvesting the plants in small quadrat plots. Although large differences were found between aboveground-biomass-estimates in different patches of different growth stages, the aboveground biomass in a 1.0 ha plot was 509 t/ha, and the one-sided LAI was 7.3 ha/ha. These values seem to result from the tall forest architecture with huge emergent trees (over 70 m high) and a moderate packing of plant mass indicated by the basal area value of 38.8 m2/ha for trees with DBH \xe2\x89\xa54.5 cm.'

Abstract: 'Duikers in the subfamily Cephalophinae are a group of tropical forest mammals believed to have first originated during the late Miocene. However, knowledge of phylogenetic relationships, pattern and timing of their subsequent radiation is poorly understood. Here we present the first multi-locus phylogeny of this threatened group of tropical artiodactyls and use a Bayesian uncorrelated molecular clock to estimate divergence times.'

Abstract: 'South American leaf blight (SALB) of the Par\xc3\xa1 rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg., caused by the plant pathogenic fungus Microcyclus ulei (Henn.) Arx, is recognized as the most serious threat to the natural-rubber industry worldwide. While the pathogen is currently restricted to South America, the warm humid climatic conditions in Asia and Africa, which contribute to over 97\xc2\xa0% of world\xe2\x80\x99s natural rubber production are similar to the South American tropics, indicating a significant threat to global rubber production, should the pathogen be introduced to these regions. The present study aims to assess climate suitability for the occurrence of M. ulei in different parts of the world, based on the available literature for M. ulei pathogen establishment, including temperature, relative humidity and precipitation. The risk analysis study provides a preliminary indication of the likely threat of M. ulei in different rubber growing areas of the world and highlights the need for more information on pathogen biology, diversity and environmental tolerance.'

Abstract: 'Developing countries that are willing to participate in the recently adopted (16th Session of the Conference of Parties (COP) in Cancun) mitigation mechanism of Reducing emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation - and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+) - will have to establish a national forest monitoring system in order to assess anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks. Such a system should support the Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) requirement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the REDD+ mechanism is results-based. A national forest inventory (NFI) is one potential key component of such an MRV system. Following the Decision adopted during the 15th Session of the COP in Copenhagen, the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidance and Guidelines should be used as a basis for estimating anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks and changes in forest carbon stocks and area.'

Abstract: 'Leaf segments from in vitro-grown shoot cultures of Petiveria alliacea were incubated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of zeatin, thidiazuron, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or picloram (PIC). Direct somatic embryogenesis was induced in response to all tested concentrations of 2,4-D and PIC. Primary somatic embryos displayed highly repetitive embryogenesis, both on the induction medium and in liquid hormone-free MS medium. Plantlets were obtained from these secondary embryos at an estimated frequency of 5\xc2\xa0%, after 180\xc2\xa0days of culture on half-strength MS medium gelled with 0.2\xc2\xa0% Phytagel. Simultaneous development of friable non-embryogenic callus was also observed on media containing PIC or 2,4-D at different concentrations. Cell suspension cultures initiated from these callus tissues did not show an increase in biomass. The embryogenic portions formed at the surface of the explants in response to 20.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM PIC were inoculated in hormone-free full-or half-strength liquid MS medium (MS0) and showed high rates of secondary embryogenesis, resulting in the production of a mean of 35 embryos for each embryo inoculated at the culture initiation. Embryos that started the conversion process in the liquid MS0 medium originated whole plants at a frequency of 100\xc2\xa0% when transferred to MS0 medium solidified with 0.7\xc2\xa0% agar. Acclimatization was achieved in 90\xc2\xa0% of the converted plantlets, with the production of phenotypically normal plants. This system is potentially useful for the micropropagation of this species, as well as for the production of substances with pharmacological interest, such as dibenzyl trisulfide.'

Abstract: 'European larch (Larix decidua) forests of the western Alps form extensive cultural landscapes whose resilience to global changes is currently unknown. Resilience describes the capacity of ecological systems to maintain the same state, i.e., the same function, processes, structure, and composition despite disturbances, environmental changes and internal fluctuations. Our aim is to explore the resilience of larch forests to changes in climate and land use in the western Italian Alps. To do so, we examined whether larch forests can be described as an alternative stable state in mountain forest ecosystems. We used tree basal area data obtained from field forest inventories in combination with topography, forest structure, land use, and climate information. We applied three different probabilistic methods: frequency distributions, logistic regressions, and potential analyses to infer the resilience of larch forests relative to that of other forest types. We found patters indicative of alternative stable states: bimodality in the frequency distribution of the percent of larch basal area, and the presence of an unstable state, i.e., mixed larch forests, in the potential analyses. We also found: (1) high frequency of pure larch forests at high elevation, (2) the probability of pure larch forests increased mostly with elevation, and (3) pure larch forests were a stable state in the upper montane and subalpine belts. Our study shows that the resilience of larch forests may increase with elevation, most likely due to the altitudinal effect on climate. Under the same climate conditions, land use seems to be the main factor governing the dominance of larch forests. In fact, subalpine larch forests may be more resilient, and natural succession after land abandonment, e.g., towards Pinus cembra forests, seems slower than in montane larch forests. In contrast, in the upper montane belt only intense land use regimes characterized by open canopies and forest grazing may maintain larch forests. We conclude that similar approaches could be applied in other forest ecosystems to infer the resilience of tree species.'

Abstract: 'I review the status of scientific, political, and moral problems of global climate change (GCC) and, based on lessons from environmental and sustainability programs in universities, demonstrate that universities have had a lethargic response to urgent needs to mitigate the problems. I explore reasons for the response, and conclude that there is an urgent need for comprehensive and wide\xe2\x80\x93ranging change in universities to help mitigate GCC. My discussion is focused on those within universities as well as those in environmental professions regardless of their areas of specialization.'

Abstract: 'Two species of Bacillus, B. thuringiensis B3 and B. cereus B6, isolated from crude oil-contaminated sites in Ecuador, were tested for their capability in degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in diesel (shake-flask), and to remove total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) from crude oil- or spent lubricating oil-polluted soils (plot-scale). TPHs and PAHs were analyzed by Gas chromatography-Flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. Degradation percentages of PAHs by strain B6 were in the range of 11\xe2\x80\x9383 after 30 days. A mixed culture of both the strains removed 84% and 28% of TPHs from crude oil- and spent lubricating oil-polluted soils, respectively. Reduction in the abundance of total n-alkane fractions (C8\xe2\x80\x93C40) of spent lubricating oil was 94%, which was 18% higher than the control. Our results clearly indicate that the selected strains have great potential in degrading petroleum hydrocarbons at both laboratory- and field-scales.'

Abstract: 'Conservation scientists are arguing whether naturalness provides a reasonable \xe2\x80\x9cimperative\xe2\x80\x9d for conservation. To clarify this debate and the interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cnatural,\xe2\x80\x9d I analyze three management strategies \xe2\x80\x93 ecosystem preservation, ecosystem restoration, and ecosystem engineering \xe2\x80\x93 with respect to the naturalness of their outcomes. This analysis consists in two parts. First, the ambiguous term \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d is defined in a variety of ways, including (1) naturalness as that which is part of nature, (2) naturalness as a contrast to artifactuality, (3) naturalness as an historical independence from human actions, and (4) naturalness as possession of certain properties. After that, I analyze the different conceptions with respect to their implications for the three management strategies. The main conclusion is that there exists no single conception of naturalness that could distinguish between the outcomes of the three management methods. Therefore, as long as the outcomes of the different methods are regarded as being of a different value in conservation, we should either abandon the idea of naturalness as the guiding concept in conservation or use the term \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d only in the ways that take both its historical and feature dependent meanings into consideration.'

Abstract: ' It has long been assumed that the North American pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor (L.) (Papilionidae, Troidini), is protected from natural enemies by aristolochic acids sequestered from its Aristolochia food plants. This study confirmed that populations of B. philenor from Virginia and east Texas sequester these compounds. A comparison of the aristolochic acid profiles of the Virginia butterflies and their A. macrophylla food plants revealed several differences. The aristolochic acid fraction of the foliage was dominated by aristolochic acids I and II, whereas the insects had a much lower proportion of aristolochic acid II and contained, in addition, substantial amounts of aristolochic acids Ia and IVa, which were not detected in the plants. The eggs, larval integument, osmeterial glands, pupal cuticle, and adults (wings and bodies) all contained aristolochic acids. These findings help explain the abundant ecological data indicating that both immature and adult B. philenor are unpalatable and protected from natural enemies.'

Abstract: 'The timing of migration can have important survival impacts, as birds must synchronize their movements with favourable environmental conditions to reach their destination. The timing of arrival at and duration of migratory stopover may be largely governed by environmental conditions experienced en route as well as by endogenous factors, but our understanding of these processes is limited. We used light-level geolocators to collect start-to-finish spatio-temporal migration data for a declining aerial insectivore, the Purple Martin (Progne subis), that travels seasonally between North and South America. Using data obtained for birds originating from range-wide breeding populations, our objectives were to test intrinsic and extrinsic hypotheses for migration stopover duration as well as to identify important stopover regions during fall migration. We examined whether breeding latitude, fall migration timing, age, sex or habitat quality at stopover sites (measured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) influenced the duration of stopovers. We found that most individuals rely on the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Honduras, and Nicaragua for stopovers during fall migration, where duration ranged from 1 to 36\xc2\xa0days (average 6.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08.2). Stopovers in these regions were later and of longer duration for more northern breeding populations. Only breeding latitude predicted stopover duration, and not habitat quality at stopovers, lending support to the hypothesis that duration is prescribed by endogenous factors. The important core stopover regions we documented could be targeted for conservation efforts, particularly for steeply-declining, more northern breeding populations that have greater stopover duration in these areas.'

Abstract: 'Studies that focused on Calliphoridae associated with pig carcasses are abundant in southern and southeastern Brazil; however, there are few in northeast. Here, we present an inventory of the blowfly species associated with the stages of decomposition of pig carcasses in a caatinga area during dry and rainy seasons. The study took place at the Private Reserve for the Environmental Inheritance \xe2\x80\x9cFazenda Almas,\xe2\x80\x9d state of Para\xc3\xadba, Brazil. Using a modified version of the Shannon trap, 32,909 adult specimens belonging to eight species were captured. During the dry season, Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) (52.2%) and Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) (39.9%) were the most abundant species. In the rainy season, when the majority of individuals were captured (93.7%), Chloroprocta idioidea (Robineau-Desvoidy) (71.1%) was the most abundant. Five decomposition stages were recognized, being the active decay the most attractive to colonization by blowflies, except for Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann), which was more abundant in the bloated stage.'

Abstract: 'Due to the high level of biological diversity in the Congo Basin and human population dependence on bushmeat, the DRC represents an ideal location for expanding knowledge on wild animal exposures and thus the potential for transmission of zoonotic pathogens. However, limited information exists on patterns and extent of contact with wildlife in such communities. Using a cross-sectional study, 14 villages in the Sankuru Province of the DRC were surveyed between August and September 2007. Villagers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0year of age and at home of the time of the survey were eligible and enrolled to describe and assess factors associated with animal exposures (both activity and type of animal). Among respondents, 91% reported exposure to rodents, 89% to duikers, 78% to non-human primates (NHPs), and 32% reported contact with bats in the month prior to the survey. The most frequently reported activities included eating (95%), cooking (70%), and butchering or skinning of animals (55%). The activities and animals to which subjects had contact varied by sex and age. Moreover, we observed a high correlation of the same activities across animal types. In this and other populations that rely on bushmeat, there is a high frequency of exposure to multiple animal species through various modalities. In the event of future zoonotic disease outbreaks, effective public health interventions and campaigns that mitigate the risk of animal contact during outbreaks need to be broad to include various modes of contact and should be directed to both men and women across all age groups. As available information is limited, further studies are necessary to better understand the complex relationships and exposures individuals have with animals.'

Abstract: 'Cryptococcosis, caused by Cryptococcus gattii sensu lato, is an emerging disease that was initially found in (sub)tropical regions but recently expanded to temperate regions. Cryptococcus gattii s.l. infections are mostly encountered in healthy individuals, frequently affecting both lungs and the central nervous system (CNS). Usually, C. gattii s.l. is less susceptible to antifungal compounds than its counterpart, C. neoformans s.l. We studied 18 clinical C. gattii s.l. isolates with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting, mating-typing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and antifungal susceptibility testing. All isolates were C. deuterogattii (genotype AFLP6/VGII), 14 were mating-type \xce\xb1 and four were type a. Amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and isavuconazole showed high activity, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 0.063\xe2\x80\x930.25, 0.031\xe2\x80\x930.25, 0.031\xe2\x80\x930.25, 0.031\xe2\x80\x930.25 and <0.016\xe2\x80\x930.25\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0mL\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. Fluconazole and flucytosine had high geometric mean MICs of 2.07 and 3.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0mL\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. Most cases occurred in immunocompetent patients (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8910; 55.6\xc2\xa0%) and CNS involvement was the most common clinical presentation (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8914; 77.8\xc2\xa0%). Three patients (16.7\xc2\xa0%) showed sequelae, hyperreflexia, dysarthria, diadochokinesia, anosmia and upper limb weakness. In conclusion, all infections were caused by C. deuterogattii (AFLP6/VGII) and the majority of patients were immunocompetent, with the CNS as the most affected site. All antifungal drugs had high in vitro activity against C. deuterogattii isolates, except fluconazole and flucytosine.'

Abstract: 'We describe seven encounters between different harpy eagle individuals (Harpia harpyja) and a group of yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus xanthosternos) in Una Biological Reserve. These interactions lasted 58\xc2\xa0min on average. In each of those encounters, the capuchin monkeys used particular behavioral strategies against the harpy eagle that were not employed in reaction to other aerial predators. We did not observe any successful predation events, but after one of those encounters an infant disappeared from the capuchin group. As a whole, these observations indicate that the presence of harpy eagles in the group\xe2\x80\x99s home range increases predation risk for capuchin monkeys. The present report also suggests a reoccupation by H. harpyja of this area, as no previous recent records identify harpy eagle occurrence in Una Biological Reserve.'

Abstract: 'Air temperature feedback results from the thermal-radiative coupling between the atmosphere and the surface and plays an important role in surface energy balance. This paper reveals the contribution of air temperature feedback to the global warming from 1980 to 2000. The air temperature feedback kernel, evaluated using the ERA-Interim reanalysis data, is used to discuss the physical mechanism for air temperature feedback, the dependency of the strength of air temperature feedback on the climatological spatial distributions of air temperature, water vapor and cloud content, and the contributions of air temperature feedback to rapid global warming. The coupling between temperature feedback and each of the external forcings and individual feedback processes will amplify the anomaly of direct energy flux convergence at the surface induced by the external forcings and individual processes. The air temperature feedback amplifies the initial surface warming due to the increase in CO2 concentration, ice and snow melting, increase in water vapor, and change in ocean heat storage. It also amplifies the surface warming due to the longwave radiaitve forcing associated with the increase in cloud cover, which acts to suppress the cooling of the shortwave effect of cloud forcing. Overall, temperature feedback plays an important role in the global warming from 1980 to 2000, as the net positive contribution to the perturbation of global mean energy flux at the surface from the air temperature feedback is larger than the net negative contribution from external forcing and all non-temperature feedbacks.'

Abstract: 'We provide a comprehensive review of publications regarding the conservation of aquatic and terrestrial insects at a global scale and with an emphasis on southern South America. We reviewed three prominent conservation journals (Conservation Biology, Biodiversity and Conservation, and Biological Conservation) and found that only 5\xc2\xa0% of all the works published between 1995 and 2008 focus on the conservation of aquatic insects. The highest percentage of publications on the conservation of aquatic insects comes from Europe (2.3\xc2\xa0%), while the lowest percentage comes from South America (0.1\xc2\xa0%). To assess the trends of aquatic insect research in southern South America, we conducted a literature search using Zoological Records, Biological Abstracts, and Current Contents. We conclude that there is a gap in research regarding the conservation of freshwater and terrestrial insects, as reflected by the low amount of publications that specifically focus on the description and identification of new insect species and their conservation. In order to help overcome this gap in conservation research, we propose three ideas that could help enhance the research and conservation initiatives regarding these organisms: (1) focus research on understudied regions of the world, such as the Magellanic sub-Antarctic ecoregion, (2) increase the amount of funding available for taxonomic research focused on the description and identification of new aquatic and terrestrial insect species, and (3) increase the amount of public education programs which focus on field experiences and direct encounters with aquatic insect biodiversity and their habitats.'

Abstract: 'Caryocar brasiliense is a flagship species of the Brazilian Cerrado. It produces flowers with a strong peculiar scent, which are pollinated by bats and occasionally moths with short mouthparts. However, the cues responsible for attracting these nocturnal pollinators remain unknown. We aimed to identify osmophores of C. brasiliense, describe the ultrastructure of the cells involved in the synthesis and release of floral odour, and identify the constituents of the floral bouquet. We performed field observations and histochemical and ultrastructural analyses of flowers focusing on the androecium. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyse the scents emitted. Filament epidermal cells were found to possess an unusual shape and be responsible for the main production and release of odour. These cells, called foraminous cells, are elongate and possess pores where their cell walls are abruptly thin. The cuticle is practically absent over the pores, which facilitates odour emission. The foraminous cells have conspicuous nuclei and organelle-rich cytoplasm where oil droplets can be seen prior to anthesis. The features of these cells remain similar during anthesis, but many vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and the number of oil droplets in the cytosol decreases. Twenty-nine components were found in the scent, especially fatty acid derivatives and N- and S-bearing compounds. Our analyses revealed that the androecium of C. brasiliense has a particular structure that acts as an osmophore. The scent from the androecium resembles that of the entire flower, which is an unprecedented finding for a plant with single flowers as the pollination unit.'

Abstract: 'Gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements of expanding and adult leaves of four plant species were compared under field conditions. The pioneer species (PS) tended to have thinner leaves with lower nitrogen content and higher stomatal density compared to forest species (FS). Expanding leaves featured lower photosynthetic pigment contents and gas exchange capacity than adult leaves consistent with an immature photosynthetic apparatus. At the time of maximum irradiance, sun-exposed leaves of both PS and FS showed alteration of initial, variable, and maximum fluorescence as well as their ratios indicating photoinhibition. However, leaves recovered to some extent at predawn, suggesting the activation of photoprotective mechanisms. Sun-exposed leaves had comparable responses to high irradiance.'

Abstract: "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential antinociceptive and toxicity of Canavalia boliviana lectin (CboL) using different methods in mice. The role of carbohydrate-binding sites was also investigated. CboL given to mice daily for 14\xc2\xa0days at doses of 5\xc2\xa0mg/kg did not cause any observable toxicity. CboL (1, 5, and 10\xc2\xa0mg/kg) administered to mice intravenously inhibited abdominal constrictions induced by acetic acid and the two phases of the formalin test. In the hot plate and tail immersion tests, the same treatment of CboL induced significant increase in the latency period. In the hot plate test, the effect of CboL (5\xc2\xa0mg/kg) was reversed by naloxone (1\xc2\xa0mg/kg), indicating the involvement of the opioid system. In the open-field and rota-rod tests, the CboL treatment did not alter animals' motor function. These results show that CboL presents antinociceptive effects of both central and peripheral origin, involving the participation of the opioid system via lectin domain."

Abstract: 'Natural resources, especially the forest provide a means of livelihood to rural communities in most developing countries. Unfortunately these resources are under the threat of disappearing because of high population growth rates and poverty that characterise these communities. Any attempt by development agencies at conserving these resources is tantamount to depriving these rural areas of their survival base. Yet due to its strategic socio-economic and cultural importance, the forest ecosystem needs to be sustained for future generations. This paper examines the various challenges faced by the State and other conservation agencies in natural resource management and the possible options which can be employed in an effort to ensure a sustainable exploitation of the forest in Anglophone Cameroon. It discusses the efforts of these actors, within the framework of the emerging concept of community forestry, local community strengthening and integrated rural development. While highlighting some of the achievements of international NGOs like Bird Life International and World Wide Fund for Nature in the region, the study concludes that the future of sustainable management of forest resources relies on a holistic poverty alleviation approach that takes into consideration the empowerment of these communities. This will ensure that they participate and benefit from the exploitation of the resources in the form of local development.'

Abstract: 'Characterizations of the dynamics of hybrid zones in space and time can give insights about traits and processes important in population divergence and speciation. We characterized a hybrid zone between tanagers in the genus Ramphocelus (Aves, Thraupidae) located in southwestern Colombia. We evaluated whether this hybrid zone originated as a result of secondary contact or of primary differentiation, and described its dynamics across time using spatial analyses of molecular, morphological, and coloration data in combination with paleodistribution modeling.'

Abstract: 'Information about plant growth, development and age forms the basis for understanding complex forest ecological processes. Although lianas play an important role in tropical forests, little is known about their growth and development from either climatic or ecological perspectives. Therefore, we studied the growth rings in Legume liana species collected in a mountainous Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. Four of the eight studied species did not show cambial variants, three had a lobed stem, and one had a furrowed xylem. Distinct growth rings were observed in all species. Semi-ring porosity, marginal parenchyma, fibrous zone and radially flattened latewood cells were the main characteristic features of these growth rings. Species without cambial variants, including Dalbergia frutescens, Piptadenia adiantoides, P. micracantha and Senegalia tenuifolia, showed very distinct growth rings visible in macroscopic and microscopic analysis. Ring-width time series and cambial wound assessment were performed to analyze periodicity and dendrochronology. The species with cambial variants, S. grandistipula, S. lacerans, S. martiusiana and S. pedicellata, also showed distinct growth rings, however, sometimes barely detectable or not detected at all. Cambial wounding, cross-dating and climate-growth relationships indicated the annual nature of growth rings in species without cambial variant. Cross-dating between radii within one individual and between individuals was successful, and the synchronized series enabled us to build species chronologies and a mean chronology. Climate-growth analysis revealed significant correlations between chronologies and precipitation, indicating that available moisture is the main factor determining growth rates of lianas in the Atlantic forest.'

Abstract: 'The carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems, which are strongly coupled via water use efficiency (WUE), are influenced by global climate change. To explore the relationship between the carbon and water cycles and predict the effect of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems, it is necessary to study the WUE in global terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, the 13-year WUE (i.e., net primary production (NPP)/evapotranspiration (ET)) of global terrestrial ecosystems was calculated based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) NPP (MOD17A3) and ET (MOD16A3) products from 2000 to 2012. The results indicate that the annual average WUE decreased but not significantly, and the 13-year mean value was 868.88 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921. The variation trend of WUE value for each pixel differed greatly across the terrestrial ecosystems. A significant variation (P<0.05) occurred in about 18.50% of the land surface. WUE was spatially distributed from 0 to 2541 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921, and 58.78% of the WUE values were concentrated in the interval of 600\xe2\x80\x931200 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921. The WUE increased from north to south in Africa and Oceania and from east to west in Europe and South America. Both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients existed in Asia and North America. The following trends in the WUE of different continents and K\xc3\xb6ppen\xe2\x80\x93Geiger climates were observed: Europe (1129.71 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> Oceania (1084.46 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> Africa (893.51 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> South America (893.07 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> North America (870.79 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> Asia (738.98 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921) and warm temperate climates (1094 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> snowy climates (862 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> arid climates (785 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> equatorial climates (732 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921)> polar climates (435 mg C m \xe2\x88\x922 mm \xe2\x88\x921). Based on the WUE value and the present or future rainfall, the maximum carbon that fixed in one region may be theoretically calculated. Also, under the background of global climatic change, WUE may be regarded as an important reference for allotting CO 2 emissions offsets and carbon transactions.'

Abstract: 'In practically every human culture, the use of arthropods as medicinal resources has been reported. In Mexico, the Mayan people mainly use plants but occasionally also animals and minerals in their medicine. This article is the first to report the traditional use of the tarantula Brachypelma vagans by medicine men in the Chol community, an ancient indigenous group that inhabits the southeastern part of Mexico. We also describe the utility of such arachnids in traditional medicine.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the response of ecosystems to past climate is critical for evaluating the impacts of future climate changes. A large-scale abrupt shift of vegetation in response to the Holocene gradual climate changes has been well documented for the Sahara-Sahel ecosystem. Whether such a non-linear response is of universal significance remains to be further addressed. Here, we examine the vegetation-climate relationships in central Asia based on a compilation of 38 high-quality pollen records. The results show that the Holocene vegetation experienced two major abrupt shifts, one in the early Holocene (Shift I, establishing shift) and another in the late Holocene (Shift II, collapsing shift), while the mid-Holocene vegetation remained rather stable. The timings of these shifts in different regions are asynchronous, which are not readily linkable with any known abrupt climate shifts, but are highly correlated with the local rainfalls. These new findings suggest that the observed vegetation shifts are attributable to the threshold effects of the orbital-induced gradual climate changes. During the early Holocene, the orbital-induced precipitation increase would have first reached the threshold for vegetation \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment\xe2\x80\x9d for moister areas, but significantly later for drier areas. In contrast, the orbital-induced precipitation decrease during the late Holocene would have first reached the threshold, and led to the vegetation \xe2\x80\x9ccollapse\xe2\x80\x9d for drier areas, but delayed for moister areas. The well-known 4.2 kyr BP drought event and human intervention would have also helped the vegetation collapses at some sites. These interpretations are strongly supported by our surface pollen-climate analyses and ecosystem simulations. These results also imply that future climate changes may cause abrupt changes in the dry ecosystem once the threshold is reached.'

Abstract: ' Rhynchospora is one of the most species-rich genera of Cyperaceae and one of the few with entomophilous species. Considering the few anatomical studies of the genus, especially of the reproductive structures, this study comparatively analysed the anatomy of flowers of two representative species of Rhynchospora, R. consanguinea and R. pubera, including the floral vasculature and the anatomy of the style base, which is persistent with the fruit. Both species have congested inflorescences with light-coloured bracts and bisexual flowers, and phenolic idioblasts in the anthers and gynoecium, characteristics that suggest insect pollination. In R. consanguinea, the bisexual and the most proximal male flower has perianths, a new character state reported for the genus. The floral vasculature pattern is similar in both species, but differs from that previously described for Rhynchospora. In both species, there are two vascular bundles in the rachilla, which split into three receptacular bundles, the latter forming a vascular plexus where the bundles of stamens, gynoecium and ovule are connected. No lateral carpellary trace was observed, and the presence of the abaxial receptacular bundle was interpreted as a vestige of the tricarpellate ancestral condition. In the fruit of both species, the thickened style base (stylopodium) has a parenchyma with idioblasts containing phenolic compounds and idioblasts with helical or reticulate cell wall thickenings. The stylopodium is a homologous structure in the species of Rhynchospora and to other genera of Cyperoideae and evolved several times in the subfamily.'

Abstract: 'The neotropical genusExostema comprises 25 species of trees and shrubs, ranging in distribution from Bolivia to Mexico and throughout the West Indies, with most species endemic to the Greater Antilles. Infrageneric relationships and species-level patterns of evolution were investigated in phylogenetic analyses using morphological, molecular, and combined data sets. All data sets resolved three main species groups which correspond to the three sections recognized byMcDowell (1996). However, the analyses of ITS sequence data placed the two South American species basal to the three main clades. Otherwise, the morphological and molecular data are highly compatible, and produce a more robust yet consistent phylogeny in the combined data analysis. Morphological evolution inExostema involves many specializations for xeric habitats, reflecting repeated ecological shifts from moist forest to exposed, seasonally dry environments during the diversification of the genus. Both moth and bee pollination syndromes are found inExostema, and shifts in pollination ecology appear pivotal to the differentiation of the three sections. Biogeographically,Exostema likely originated in South America and migrated via Central America to the Greater Antilles, where the morphological diversification and speciation are most extensive.'

Abstract: 'The World Wide Web (WWW) represents the largest and arguably the most complex repository of content at our current state of technological development. Information on the web is represented using a variety of media, with a (current) predominance of text- and images-based data and increasing presence of other media such as video and audio. The complexity and heterogeneity of the information implies that the associated semantics is often user-dependent and emergent. Thus, there is a need to develop novel paradigms for web-based user-data interactions that emphasize user context and interactivity with the goal of facilitating exploration, interpretation, retrieval, and assimilation of information. This article presents a novel presentation-interaction paradigm for exploratory web search which allows simultaneous and semantically correlated presentation of query results from different semantic perspectives. Users can explore the results either using a specific perspective or through a combination of perspectives via highly-intuitive yet powerful interaction operators. In the proposed paradigm, hits obtained from executing a query are first analyzed to determine latent content-based correlations between the pages. Next, the pages are analyzed to extract different types of perceptual and informational cues. This information is used to organize and present the results through an interactive and reflective user interface which supports both exploration and search. Experimental investigations, many of which are conducted in comparative settings, analyze the proposed approach in query-retrieval scenarios involving complex information goals. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and provide important insights for the development of the next-generation of interfaces for web-search.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated the contribution of seed dispersal by birds to the colonization of fleshy-fruited plants beneath plants that bear fleshy fruits and were used as perches by birds. Specifically, we investigated the composition of seeds and saplings sampled beneath nine fleshy-fruited perch plant species in a Pinus thunbergii stand on a coastal sand dune in central Japan. Both the numbers and the species numbers of bird-dispersed (pulpless) seeds differed significantly among the perch plant species. Nevertheless, the quantitative compositions of bird-dispersed seeds were similar among the perch plant species because of the significant positive interspecific correlations of species rank order in numbers of bird-dispersed seeds per species. Similar relationships were also found for saplings. For each perch plant species, the numbers of fallen conspecific seeds were significantly higher than or not different from those of heterospecific seeds. Furthermore, the numbers of pulpy seeds that fell directly from the perch plant were significantly higher than those of bird-dispersed conspecific seeds for seven of nine perch plant species. However, the densities of conspecific saplings were significantly lower than those of heterospecific saplings. Most pulpy seeds, therefore, probably do not germinate beneath their mother plants, and conspecific seeds probably accumulate in seed banks or are consumed by herbivores.'

Abstract: 'The brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) is the most widespread tick in the world and a well-recognized vector of many pathogens affecting dogs and occasionally humans. This tick can be found on dogs living in both urban and rural areas, being highly adapted to live within human dwellings and being active throughout the year not only in tropical and subtropical regions, but also in some temperate areas. Depending on factors such as climate and host availability, Rh. sanguineus can complete up to four generations per year. Recent studies have demonstrated that ticks exposed to high temperatures attach and feed on humans and rabbits more rapidly. This observation suggests that the risk of human parasitism by Rh. sanguineus could increase in areas experiencing warmer and/or longer summers, consequently increasing the risk of transmission of zoonotic agents (e.g., Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia rickettsii). In the present article, some aspects of the biology and ecology of Rh. sanguineus ticks are discussed including the possible impact of current climate changes on populations of this tick around the world.'

Abstract: 'Microsatellites markers were developed for Paypayrola blanchetiana (Violaceae), a near-dispersing forest tree forming aggregated populations, to investigate genetic diversity and gene flow among subpopulations in a fragmented environment. Next generation sequencing (Illumina platform) was used to develop ten nuclear microsatellite loci and one plastid microsatellite locus that amplify in P. blanchetiana. Polymorphism was tested in two subpopulations separated by a distance of approximately 11\xc2\xa0km. The identified loci contained between two and five alleles per locus. Observed heterozygosity ranged between 0.063 and 0.563 in both subpopulations, while expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.063 to 0.567 in the first, and 0.063\xe2\x80\x930.627 in the second subpopulation. The microsatellites are among the first in the family Violaceae and will be useful for population genetic studies in this species. Amplification was successful in one further Paypayrola species from Amazonia, which suggest a wider usefulness of the present markers.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we compare orchid bee communities surveyed in four forest remnants of the Atlantic Forest and four reforested areas characterized by seasonal semi-deciduous forest vegetation in different successional stages (mature and secondary vegetation), located in southern Brazil. The sizes of forest remnants and reforested areas varied from 32.1 to 583.9\xc2\xa0ha and from 11.3 to 33.3\xc2\xa0ha, respectively. All reforested areas were located near one forest remnant. During samplings, totaling nine per study area, euglossine males were attracted to eight scent baits and captured with bait trap and entomological nets. Each forest remnant and its respective reforested area were sampled simultaneously by two collectors. We collected 435 males belonging to nine species of orchid bees distributed in four genera. The number of individuals and species did not differ significantly between different areas, except for a reforested area (size 33.3\xc2\xa0ha), which was located far from its respective forest remnant. Our findings also revealed an apparent association between an orchid bee species (Euglossa annectans Dressler 1982) and the most preserved area surveyed in our study, suggesting that this bee is a potential indicator of good habitat quality in recuperating or preserved areas. Our results suggest that reforested habitats located near forest remnants have a higher probability of having reinstated their euglossine communities.'

Abstract: 'The study of the time series from the township of Campo Grande in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (from January 2004 to 31 December 2010) is presented. Various statistical methods were used for the data analysis. Using robust statistics, very pronounced skewness of the ozone volume part distribution during each month of the year was obtained. The variability in data is the largest during a month of September. The average annual values have asymmetrical distribution of the ozone volume fraction. Within the measured period, these averages are between 15 and 20\xc2\xa0ppb. Particularly pronounced ozone distribution asymmetry throughout the year 2007 could be explained by observing meteorological parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) presented here clearly shows that air temperature and wind speed are contributing factors in ozone formation, while relative humidity and atmospheric pressure cause the decrease in the ozone volume fraction in the air. Further, the hierarchical cluster analysis (CA) was performed for meteorological and ozone data using the Ward\xe2\x80\x99s methods. The correlation between ozone and the effective temperature index (TEv) showed a development of the ozone with high temperature of air. From the Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s correlation coefficients, it is clear that the relative humidity and the air temperature have a negative effect on respiratory system, causing respiratory illnesses.'

Abstract: 'In order to develop a more efficient genetic transformation system for cacao somatic embryos, the effects of polyamines and \xce\xb2-lactam antibiotics on somatic embryogenesis, hygromycin as selective agent, and different factors affecting uidA gene transfer have been evaluated. The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine significantly improved secondary somatic embryogenesis in cacao. Spermine at 1,000\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM provided the best responses, increasing 6.7\xc3\x97 the percentage of embryogenic callus and 2.5\xc3\x97 the average number of embryos per embryogenic callus. The \xce\xb2-lactam antibiotics timentin and meropenem, used for Agrobacterium tumefaciens counter-selection, had a non-detrimental effect on secondary somatic embryogenesis, depending on their concentration, whereas the commonly used \xce\xb2-lactam cefotaxime inhibited it, irrespective of the tested concentration. Hygromycin showed a strong inhibitory effect on secondary somatic embryogenesis of cacao, impairing completely the embryo production at 20\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921. Following the criterion of GUS activity, the best conditions for T-DNA transfer into cotyledon explants from primary somatic embryos of cacao were a sonication of the explants for 100\xc2\xa0s, a 20-min incubation period in Agrobacterium solution, an Agrobacterium concentration of 1.0 (OD600), and cocultivation of the explants on tobacco feeder layers. These findings will have important implications for studies on functional genomics of cacao.'

Abstract: 'Habitat heterogeneity has a complex effect on ant species richness and community structure (both alpha- and beta-diversity). Savannahs and forests are thought to have distinct species assemblages, but studies comparing savannah\xe2\x80\x93forest mosaics produced conflicting results, with savannah (the less complex ecosystem) poorer in species, equally rich, or richer than forest (the most complex habitat). We compared subterranean and above ground ant assemblages in savannah and forests of Lamto Reserve (C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire) to examine how habitat heterogeneity and vertical stratification drive species composition and structure patterns. The Ants of the Leaf Litter (ALL) protocol and soil monolith were used to sample ants along 16 transects of 200\xc2\xa0m in the three main habitats (gallery forest, forest islands, and savannah). In total, 138 species from 44 genera were collected. Forested habitats held assemblages that matched those found in savannah in terms of species density and richness; however, they differed in composition. Taxonomic structure varied among habitats, with Formicinae and Amblyoponinae prevailing in savannah, and Myrmicinae numerically dominant in forests. Ants were clearly vertically stratified. Subterranean assemblages had a less even distribution of occurrences among species as compared to above ground ones. The patterns observed agree with the heterogeneity-diversity theory relative to beta-diversity but not alpha-diversity, emphasizing the difficulty to generalize across continents about factors structuring ant assemblages. Our results support the need to conserve both forest and savannah to maintain biodiversity at landscape level in C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire.'

Abstract: 'Queen, worker, and male production was studied for 1\xc2\xa0year in three queenright colonies of Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille). We sampled brood combs monthly and noticed that the number of brood cells and production of individuals were similar among colonies. Although the production of queens did not vary significantly, the frequencies of workers, males, and the number of cells among the combs varied over time. The production of males was highly seasonal, occurring mostly from February to April, coinciding with the period of intense brood cells production, when colonies produced more males and less workers, resulting in a negative correlation. Although the frequency of queens has not varied in time, the seasonal availability of males affected the mating frequency and the time spent since emergence until fertilization of queens. In the T. angustula colonies studied, the population dynamics was highly seasonal and the mating success depended of male production, according to the season.'

Abstract: 'It is crucial for biodiversity conservation that protected areas are large and effective enough to support viable populations of their original species. We used a point count distance sampling method to estimate population sizes of a range of bird species in three Atlantic forest protected areas of size 5600, 22,500, and 46,050\xc2\xa0ha. Population sizes were generally related to reserve area, although in the mid-sized reserve, there were many rare species reflecting a high degree of habitat heterogeneity. The proportions of forest species having estimated populations >500 ranged from 55% of 210 species in the largest reserve to just 25% of 140 species in the smallest reserve. All forest species in the largest reserves had expected populations >100, but in the small reserve, 28% (38 species) had populations <100 individuals. Atlantic forest endemics were no more or less likely to have small populations than widespread species. There are 79 reserves (>1000\xc2\xa0ha) in the Atlantic forest lowlands. However, all but three reserves in the north of the region (Esp\xc3\xadrito Santo and states north) are smaller than 10,000\xc2\xa0ha, and we predict serious levels of local extinction from these reserves. Habitat heterogeneity within reserves may promote species richness within them, but it may also be important in determining species loss over time by suppressing populations of individual species. We suggest that most reserves in the region are so small that homogeneity in the habitat/altitude within them is beneficial for maintenance of their (comparatively small) original species compliment. A lack of protection in the north, continued detrimental human activity inside reserves, and our poor knowledge of how well the reserve system protects individual taxa, are crucial considerations in biodiversity management in the region.'

Abstract: 'Leaves from over 1000 Brazilian native plants growing in the cerrado and neighbouring regions were sampled for C and N content. Half of these were analysed for 15N and further samples for 13C and ash content. Nodulated legumes from all three sub-families were included, together with two types of reference plant, non-nodulated legumes and non-legumes. Particular emphasis was placed on the large caesalpinioid genus Chamaecrista which is here for the first time reported to fix nitrogen in its native habitats. Woody and herbaceous species of this and other nodulated genera, with the exception of the mimosoid tree Stryphnodendron, showed evidence of nitrogen fixation. Amounts fixed were site-specific as was the 15N signature of reference plants. There was no evidence that nodulated legumes had higher leaf N than non-nodulated legumes: both were higher than non-legumes. Several species of Chamaecrista from section absus and species of Stryphnodendron had carbon contents of 50\xe2\x80\x9355%, higher than previously reported for leaves. This was coupled with low (1\xe2\x80\x933%) ash contents. The 13C values of plants with \xe2\x89\xa549% C were significantly more negative than those with <49% C: most species in the former group were woody and most in the latter group herbaceous. Mimosa pudica was unusual in having a wide range of percent C, percent ash and 13C values; these parameters were significantly correlated. It is concluded that Brazilian native legumes can fix significant amounts of nitrogen in the nutrient-poor cerrado soils. Consideration of mineral and lipid nutrition will be necessary in order fully to understand relations between 13C, carbon content and other physiological parameters.'

Abstract: 'We investigated total primary production and natural abundance of 13C in soil and plants in the landscape of tiger bush, Niger. Tiger bush is viewed as a natural cyclic succession of several types of vegetation (grasses, living trees and senescent vegetation) occurring over very small areas, on soils with similar chemical and physical characteristics. Under the pioneer front, production was 130\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x80\x931 of which 23% came from C4 plants; under the thicket of mature trees, grass production was 190\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x80\x931 (all C3 grasses) and under senescent vegetation, 40\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x80\x931 of which 1.5% came from C4 plants. Total above- and belowground primary production was estimated to be 890\xe2\x80\x934880\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x80\x931 of which 0.4\xe2\x80\x930.5% was contributed by C4 plants. From 29 to 45% of the soil organic carbon originated from C4 plants even though the contribution of C4 grasses to total primary production did not exceed 0.5%. We suggest that the order in which the different sources of organic matter entered the soil could lead to the overlabelling of soil organic matter with a C4 print. Because all C4 plants are grasses located in the pioneer front of tiger bush bands, their C4 organic matter enters the soil first and fixes onto clays. The C3 organic matter enters the soil several years later and is also fixed by the clays but in a lower proportion. Therefore it is less protected from microbial activity and quickly decomposes. We postulate that the repetition of this pattern over many decades (incorporation of a pure C4 material to soil, followed by the incorporation of a C3-dominated material), leads to the overaccumulation of C4 compounds on the most protective sites.'

Abstract: 'We applied a series of intra- and interspecific in situ cross-pollination experiments under greenhouse conditions to evaluate the breeding systems in four Fosterella species (Pitcairnioideae s.str.; Bromeliaceae). Viable hybrids were produced between each pair of the investigated species, suggesting that reproduction barriers may be low also under natural conditions. Seed germination rates proved to be high in each crossing treatment, indicating a high viability of the artificial hybrids. Large numbers of seeds were produced after both closed and open pollination treatments, suggesting that autogamy may be a major reproductive strategy in the genus. Our results support the concept that self-compatibility is an appropriate way to avoid natural hybridization in Bromeliaceae and could assist in maintaining species integrity in the presence of pollen flow. Paternity was verified in all crosses by genotyping parents and offspring with a set of polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers. To study the mode of chloroplast inheritance, we developed a novel set of 24 chloroplast microsatellite markers using 454 pyrosequencing technology, and applied four of these markers for genotyping parents and offspring from all crosses. Our results clearly demonstrated a maternal inheritance of plastids.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we simulated and analyzed the monthly variations of stable water isotopes in different reservoirs at Manaus, Brazil, using the Community Land Model (CLM) that incorporates stable isotopic effects as a diagnostic tool for understanding stable water isotopic processes, filling the observational data gaps and predicting hydrometeorological processes. The simulation results show that the \xce\xb418O values in precipitation, vapor and surface runoff have distinct seasonality with the marked negative correlations with corresponding water amount. Compared with the survey results by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in co-operation with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the simulations by CLM reveal the similar temporal distributions of the \xce\xb418O in precipitation. Moreover, the simulated amount effect between monthly \xce\xb418O and monthly precipitation amount, and MWL (meteoric water line) are all close to the measured values. However, the simulated seasonal difference in the \xce\xb418O in precipitation is distinctly smaller than observed one, and the simulated temporal distribution of the \xce\xb418O in precipitation displays the ideal bimodal seasonality rather than the observed single one. These mismatches are possibly related to the simulation capacity and the veracity in forcing data.'

Abstract: 'The individual growth of tree diameter at breast height (dbh) is analyzed in an even-aged plantation of Cryptomeria japonica from stand age of 45 to 94 years, to examine how the growth of individual trees has been affected by the changes in spacing resulting from thinning operations. At any age, a significant proportion (0.37\xe2\x80\x930.46) of the variation in dbh growth during a 5\xe2\x80\x9311-year period was explained by dbh at the beginning of the period, probably due to greater leaf mass of larger trees. Next, either one-sided or two-sided competition was added to the model, by calculating the basal area (BA) of neighboring trees around each tree within a given radius or BA for trees having larger dbh than the focal tree within the radius. After preliminary analyses, a radius of 8\xe2\x80\x89m was selected as the critical range for tree competition. Although both types of competition explained a significant proportion (0.09\xe2\x80\x930.43) of growth variation, one-sided competition was not significant at ages greater than 54 years. Based on the model at 45 years of age, the initial deviation of growth rate for each tree from the predicted rate was calculated and added to the models as a third variable. This raised the coefficient of determination up to 0.50\xe2\x80\x930.74. These findings have practical significance for forest plantation management, particularly for controlling the growth of standing trees via thinning, to produce high-quality timber in the future.'

Abstract: 'Computer-based technologies are becoming increasingly important in translating the wealth of agricultural research information into forms that can be used by extension workers. The Acidity Decision Support System (ADSS) is a computer-based expert system that diagnoses and corrects Al-toxicity problems on highly-weathered mineral soils. The objectives of this work were to use published data to evaluate and provide recommendations to improve the ADSS knowledge base. The relative yield-Al saturation curves used by ADSS satisfactorily predict the results of field experiments for maize and soybean, but needs to be improved for rice and cassava. Curves used by ADSS for all four crops should, however, be updated to represent the research data better. Insufficient data were obtained to evaluate other crops satisfactorily. ADSS predicted that more lime would be needed to reduce soil Al saturation than was actually needed. This can be corrected by changing the value of the liming factor (LF) constant in ADSS to better represent the capability of liming materials to neutralize soil Al in the field. ADSS also predicted more response of rice and soybean to lime in on-farm experiments than occurred in practice, although there was a correlation between predicted and actual relative yield for soybean. ADSS should indicate the chances that the predicted relative yield response will not occur because of factors other than liming, under normal farming conditions. The Smyth and Cravo equation provides a reasonable estimate, in lieu of alternatives, of the change in soil Al saturation for up to five years after liming.'

Abstract: 'Niche conservatism at distinct levels of biological hierarchy is still a highly debated topic in ecology. The general evaluation of niche shifts is mainly addressed to species level, with few explorations at lower or higher hierarchical levels. The freshwater turtle Trachemys dorbigni (Black-Bellied Slider) has recently been divided into two subspecies that occur in very different climatic conditions and is also considered to be an invasive species in parts of eastern and southeastern regions in Brazil. Here, we aimed to explore the effects of evaluating climatic niche conservatism at subspecific levels during the invasive process of T. dorbigni. We evaluated niche conservatism based on similarity (whether niches are more similar than expected by chance) and also measured expansion, stability, and unfilling in the invaded niche. We found that the climatic niches of the T. dorbigni recognized subspecies are very different, but when they are merged, the environmental condition created is more similar to the invasive niche of the subspecies T. dorbigni dorbigni. We also found consistent evidence of niche conservatism in invaded areas, which enables the effective use of ecological niche models to forecast T. dorbigni dorbigni invasion in other geographic regions.'

Abstract: '\nTarget tracking is an important application of sensor networks, particularly interesting for ecology applications related to wildlife monitoring. \nIn this context, understanding the territorial occupation of animals is fundamental for understanding their habits. In this work, we propose the PRATIQUE\xe2\x80\x94a prediction-based clustering algorithm for tracking targets considering a discrete sensor field divided into cells. This approach is based on two hierarchical levels: static clusters at the first level and dynamic clusters at the second level. This hybrid scheme reduces the cost of communication and ensures that all data generated by an event be delivered to a single node. We use Kalman, Alpha-Beta, or Particle Filters in order to predict the target\xe2\x80\x99s position. Prediction is used to prepare the set of nodes that will detect the next event, thereby reducing the message overhead during the tracking task. Results show that prediction errors are close to one cell.'

Abstract: 'Carbonyl sulfide emissions from biomass burning have been studied during field experiments conducted both in an African savanna area (Ivory Coast) and rice fields, central highland pine forest and savanna areas in Viet-Nam. During these experiments CO2, CO and C2H2 or CH4 have also been also monitored. COS values range from 0.6 ppbv outside the fires to 73 ppbv in the plumes. Significant correlations have been observed between concentrations of COS and CO (R2=0.92,n=25) and COS and C2H2 (R2=0.79,n=26) indicating a COS production during the smoldering combustion. COS/CO2 emission factors (\xce\x94COS/\xce\x94CO2) during field experiments ranged from 1.2 to 61\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x926 (11.4\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x926 mean value). COS emission by biomass burning was estimated to be up to 0.05 Tg S/yr in tropics and up to 0.07 Tg S/yr on a global basis, contributing thus about 10% to the global COS flux. Based on the S/C ratio measured in the dry plant biomass and the \xce\x94COS/\xce\x94CO2 emission factor, COS can account for only about 7% of the sulfur emitted in the atmosphere by biomass burning.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry experiments usually include control plots of either pure crop or pure tree stands. A clear distinction should be made between intensively managed biophysical controls and farming system controls with realistic labour input and management regimes. Trying to draw biophysical conclusions from farming system controls (or the reverse) is often not justifiable. The design and management of these elusive control plots is a complicated issue which is often overlooked. Many factors beyond the control of the experiment manager can disturb long term field agroforestry experiments. Some examples from French agroforestry experiments illustrate how uncontrolled factors may bias the results, including the proportion of harvested to planted trees, the weeding regimes, and the use of tree- shelters. The analysis of agroforestry data could be more efficient when considering a continuum of tree \xe2\x80\x93 crop mixture management options between the agroforestry plot and the non agroforestry plot. The concept of biophysical control plots becomes then less essential. A relevant modelling approach of interactions between trees and crops should 1) perform correctly for any tree/crop proportion and even for pure stands, when setting the parameters of the other component to zero, 2) provide for the inclusion of new, uncontrolled factors that could emerge through time. The biological efficiency of agroforestry systems may however be a subordinate criterion for agroforestry adoption, as observed at the moment in France. Agroforestry systems with poor biological outcomes can even be very attractive in some ecological or sociological conditions, and only farming system controls may bring this aspect to light.'

Abstract: 'A population of frillneck lizards, Chlamydosaurus kingii, was monitored by mark-recapture and telemetry over a 2 year period in Kakadu National Park. The aims of the study were to document changes in diet, growth, condition and habitat use between the wet and dry seasons of northern Australia, in light of recent research examining seasonal variation in the physiology of this species. Frillneck lizards feed on a diverse range of invertebrates in both seasons, even though there is a substantial reduction in food avail-ability in the dry season. Harvester termites from the genus Drepanotermes constitute a major component of the diet, and the prevalence of termites in the diet of sedentary foragers in a tropical environment is unusual. Adult male body condition remained relatively stable throughout the year, but females experienced considerable variation. These differences are attributed to different reproductive roles of the sexes. Growth in C. kingii was restricted to the wet season, when food availability was high, and growth was minimal in the dry season when food availability was low. The method used in catching lizards was an important factor in determining seasonal habitat use. Telemetered lizards selected a significantly different distribution of tree species than was randomly available, and they selected significantly larger tree species during the dry season. Lizards spotted along roadsides showed little seasonal variation in the selection of tree species or tree sizes. The results suggest a comprehensive change in the ecology of this species, in response to an annual cycle of low food and moisture availability, followed by a period with few resource restrictions.'

Abstract: 'Habitat fragmentation is the main cause of biodiversity loss, as remnant fragments are exposed to negative influences that include edge effects, prevention of migration, declines in effective population sizes, loss of genetic variability and invasion of exotic species. The Drosophilidae (Diptera), especially species of the genus Drosophila, which are highly sensitive to environmental variation, have been used as bioindicators. A twelve-month field study was conducted to evaluate the abundance and richness of drosophilids in an edge-interior transect in a fragment of semideciduous forest in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo State, Brazil. One objective of the study was to evaluate the applied methodology with respect to its potential use in future studies addressing the monitoring and conservation of threatened areas. The species abundance along the transect showed a clear gradient, with species associated with disturbed environments, such as Drosophila simulans, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis and Zaprionus indianus, being collected at the fragment edge and the species D. willistoni and D. mediostriata being found in the fragment\xe2\x80\x99s interior. Replacement of these species occurred at approximately 60 meters from the edge, which may be a reflection of edge effects on species abundance and richness because the species found within the habitat fragment are more sensitive to variations in temperature and humidity than those sampled near the edge. The results support the use of this methodology in studies on environmental impacts.'

Abstract: 'Swidden agriculture is an age-old, widespread but controversial farming practice in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (MMSEA). In the uplands of northern Laos, swidden agriculture has remained a predominant human-dominated land-use type for centuries. However, swidden system has undergone dramatic transformations since the mid-1990s. Debates on changes in swidden cultivation are linked to globally critical issues, such as land use/cover changes (LUCC), biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. Since the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), much attention has been paid nationally and internationally to swidden agriculture in the tropics. However, knowledge of the explicitly spatial characteristics of swidden agriculture and the consequences of these transitions at macroscopic scale is surprisingly scarce. In this study, the intensity of swidden use and fallow forest recovery in northern Laos in 1990, 2002, and 2011 were delineated by means of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) imagery (30 m) using a decision tree classification approach, followed by an analysis of the spatio-temporal changes in swidden agriculture. Next, annual successive TM/ETM+ images during 2000\xe2\x80\x932010 were used to delineate the dynamics of the burning and cropping phase. Subsequently, the burned pixels identified in 2000 were compared respectively with their counterparts in the following years (2001\xe2\x80\x932011) to investigate temporal trends, land-use frequency, and the swidden cycle using time-series Landsat-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Finally, as the swidden cycle changed from 1 to 11 years, the fallow vegetation recovery process was studied. The results showed that: (1) from 1990 to 2011, the area of swidden agriculture increased by 54.98%, from 1.54\xc3\x97105 ha to 2.38\xc3\x97105 ha in northern Laos. The increased swidden cultivation area was mainly distributed in Luang Prabang and southern Bokeo, whereas the decreased parts were mainly found in Phongsali; (2) swidden agriculture increased mainly at elevations of 500\xe2\x80\x93800 m, 300\xe2\x80\x93500 m, and 800\xe2\x80\x931000 m and on slopes of 10\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xb0 and 20\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xb0. Over 80% of swidden fields were transformed from forests; (3) during 2000\xe2\x80\x932011, the frequency of swidden use in northern Laos was about two or three times. The interval between two successive utilization of a swidden ranged from one to seven years. Comparison of swidden cycles and the related proportions of swidden farming in 2000, 2003, and 2007 revealed that swidden cycles in most areas were shortened; and (4) there was a significant correlation (0.97) between fallow vegetation recovery and the swidden cycle. The NDVI of regenerated vegetation could approach the average level of forest when the swidden cycle reached 10 years.'

Abstract: 'Folk experiments in agriculture are often inspired by new ideas blended with old ones, motivated by economic and environmental change. They tend to save labor or capital. These notions are illustrated with nine short case studies from Nicaragua and El Salvador. The new ideas that catalyze folk experiments may be provided by development agencies, but paradoxically, the folk experiments are so common that the agencies that inspire them usually pay little attention to them. Some folk experiments are original, but others simply copy innovations that farmers have seen somewhere else. Unlike formal scientific research, in which results are consistently written, folk experiments are rarely \xe2\x80\x9cinscribed,\xe2\x80\x9d because the results are for use by individual farmers and need not be shared with an audience.'

Abstract: 'Several remotely sensed sea surface salinity (SSS) retrievals with various resolutions from the soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) and Aquarius/SAC-D missions are applied as inputs for retrieving salinity profiles (S) using multilinear regressions. The performance is evaluated using a total root mean square (RMS) error, different error sources, and the feature resolutions of the retrieved S fields. In the mixed layer of the salinity, the SSS-S regression coefficients are uniformly large. The SSS inputs yield smaller RMS errors in the retrieved S with respect to Argo profiles as their spatial or temporal resolution decreases. The projected SSS errors are dominant, and the retrieved S values are more accurate than those of climatology in the tropics except for the tropical Atlantic, where the regression errors are abnormally large. Below that level, because of the influence of a sea level anomaly, the areas of high-accuracy S values shift to higher latitudes except in the high-latitude southern oceans, where the projected SSS errors are abnormally large. A spectral analysis suggests that the CATDS-0.25\xc2\xb0 results are much noisier and that the BEC-L4-0.25\xc2\xb0 results are much smoother than those of the other retrievals. Aquarius-CAP-1\xc2\xb0 generates the smallest RMS errors, and Aquarius-V2-1\xc2\xb0 performs well in depicting large-scale phenomena. BEC-L3-0.25\xc2\xb0, which has small RMS errors and remarkable mesoscale energy, is the best fit for portraying mesoscale features in the SSS and retrieved S fields. The current priority for retrieving S is to improve the reliability of satellite SSS especially at middle and high latitudes, by developing advanced algorithms, combining both sensors, or weighing between accuracy and resolutions.'

Abstract: 'Plant species effects on soil nutrient availability are relatively well documented, but the effects of species differences in litter chemistry on soil carbon cycling are less well understood, especially in the species-rich tropics. In many wet tropical forest ecosystems, leaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the litter layer accounts for a significant proportion of litter mass loss during decomposition. Here we investigated how tree species differences in soluble dissolved organic C (DOC) and nutrients affected soil CO2 fluxes in laboratory incubations. We leached DOM from freshly fallen litter of six canopy tree species collected from a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica and measured C-mineralization. We found significant differences in litter solubility and nutrient availability. Following DOM additions to soil, rates of heterotrophic respiration varied by as much as an order of magnitude between species, and overall differences in total soil CO2 efflux varied by more than four-fold. Variation in the carbon: phosphorus ratio accounted for 51% of the variation in total CO2 flux between species. These results suggest that tropical tree species composition may influence soil C storage and mineralization via inter-specific variation in plant litter chemistry.'

Abstract: 'In 2013, we re-inventoried all lianas (\xe2\x89\xa51\xc2\xa0cm diameter measured at 1.3\xc2\xa0m from the rooting point) in four 1-ha permanent plots distributed one each in four sites of inland tropical dry evergreen forest on the Coromandel Coast (Pudukottai district) of peninsular India, established in 2003. Among the four sites, Shanmuganathapuram (SP) and Araiyapatti (AP) were much disturbed and the other two sites (Karisakkadu\xe2\x80\x94KR and Maramadakki\xe2\x80\x94MM) were moderately disturbed. We inventoried a total of 3425 lianas representing 37 species of 33 genera and 22 families. Over a decade (2003\xe2\x80\x932013) liana species richness increased at two sites (MM and SP) and no changes occurred at the other two sites. Liana abundance increased by 210, 211, 164 and 162 individuals at sites AP, KR, MM and SP, respectively, and basal area increased (from 1.09 to 1.76\xc2\xa0m2 at AP, 0.67 to 0.86\xc2\xa0m2 at KR, 1.68 to 2.06\xc2\xa0m2 at MM, and from 0.44 to 1.06\xc2\xa0m2 at SP). Over a 10-year period, three species (Abrus precatorius, Canavalia virosa, and Cocculus hirsutus) were lost and five species (Gloriosa superba, Ampelocissus tomentosa, Capparis sepiaria, Aganosma cymosa and Tiliacora acuminata) were newly added. Total aboveground biomass increased by 18.5, 0.74, 3.6 and 9.5 Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively, at sites AP, KR, MM and SP.'

Abstract: 'The Igarap\xc3\xa9 Bahia gold deposit has developed from weathering of a near-vertical hydrothermal Cu (Au) mineralization zone. The unweathered bedrock composed of chlorite schists is mainly metamorphosed basalts, pyroclastic and clastic sedimentary rocks and iron formation. Contents and Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios of chlorites increase from distal country rock towards the mineralization zone, which can be attributed to different water/rock ratios and locations in a hydrothermal system. In the hydrothermal system high salinity fluids convected through basin-floor rocks, stripping metals from the recharge zones with precipitation in discharge zones. The chlorite with lower Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios indicates alteration by relatively unreacted Mg-rich fluids, occurring within recharge zones. By contrast, the chlorite with higher Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios in the mineralization zone formed from solutions rich in Fe, Mn, Au, Cu, H2S and SiO2 within a discharge zone. The iron formation could also be formed within the discharge zone or on the basin floor from the Fe-rich fluids. The distal country rock with less chlorite content is a hydrothermal product at low water/rock ratios whereas the proximal country rock and the host rock with more chlorite content formed at high water/rock ratio conditions. The Al(IV) contents of chlorites indicate that the formation temperatures of these rocks range from 204 to 266 \xc2\xb0C, with temperatures slightly increasing from distal country rock towards the mineralization zone.'

Abstract: 'Carbon is continuously being removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and stored in carbon pools (live, dead, and soil carbon) of forest ecosystems. However, carbon stock in dead wood and of trees with diameters at breast height (dbh) between 5 and 10\xc2\xa0cm is often not considered in many studies carried out in the Congo Basin Forest. The relationship between tree diversity, life-forms and carbon stocks has received little attention. This study was carried out on the outskirts of Deng Deng National Park (DDNP) to determine tree diversity (dominant families, species richness and Shannon index), assess carbon stocks in the five carbon compartments (living tree, understory, fine roots, dead wood and litter) as well as to analyze the relationship between (1) carbon stocks and tree diversity; and, (2) between carbon stock and life-forms. The Shannon index of trees\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0cm dbh ranged from 2.6 in riparian forest to 4.3 in secondary forest; and for the tree between 5 and 10\xc2\xa0cm, it ranged to 1.56 in riparian forest to 3.68 in the secondary forest. The study site housed 16 species, 7 genera and 3 families which are only found in trees of dbh between 5 and 10\xc2\xa0cm. The average total carbon stock of the five compartments varied from 200.1\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in forest residues to 439.1\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in secondary forest. Dead wood carbon stock varied from 1.2\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in riparian forests to 12.51t ha\xe2\x88\x921 in agroforests. The above ground carbon stocks for trees with diameter between 5 and 10\xc2\xa0cm varied from 0.7\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in young fallow fields to 5.02\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in old secondary forests. This study reveals a low but positive correlation between species richness and total carbon stocks, as well as a significant positive relationship between life-forms and total carbon stocks. The findings highlight the need for more data concerning carbon content of dead wood, carbon of trees\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x895\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0cm dbh and the relationship between carbon stocks and tree diversity from other areas of the Congo Basin for a good understanding of the contribution of tropical forests to climate change mitigation.'

Abstract: 'Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall during 2016 exhibited a prominent month-to-month fluctuations over India, with below normal rainfall in June and August and above normal rainfall in July. The factors determining the month-to-month fluctuations in ISM rainfall during 2016 are investigated with main focus on the Indo-Pacific climatic anomalies. Warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with super El Ni\xc3\xb1o 2015 disappeared by early summer 2016 over the central and eastern Pacific. On the other hand, negative Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) like SST anomaly pattern over the equatorial Indian Ocean and anomalous anticyclonic circulation over the western North Pacific (WNP) are reported in summer 2016 concurrently with decaying El Ni\xc3\xb1o/developing La Ni\xc3\xb1a phase. Observations revealed that the low rainfall over central north India in June is due to moisture divergence caused by the westward extension of ridge corresponding to WNP anticyclone and subsidence induced by local Hadley cell partly related to negative IOD. Low level convergence of southeasterly wind from Bay of Bengal associated with weak WNP anticyclone and northwesterly wind corresponding to anticyclonic circulation over the northwest India remarkably contributed to positive rainfall in July over most of the Indian subcontinent. While reduced rainfall over the Indian subcontinent in August 2016 is associated with the anomalous moisture transport from ISM region to WNP region, in contrast to July, due to local cyclogenesis corroborated by number of tropical cyclones in the WNP. In addition to this, subsidence related to strong convection supported by cyclonic circulation over the WNP also resulted in low rainfall over the ISM region. Coupled General Circulation model sensitivity experiments confirmed that strong convective activities associated with cyclonic circulation over the WNP is primarily responsible for the observed negative ISM rainfall anomalies in August 2016. It is noted that the Indo-Western Pacific circulation anomalies in August 2016 are well predicted when the coupled model is initiated with initial conditions from end of July and beginning of August compared to May. This analysis suggests the importance of the WNP circulation in forcing strong sub-seasonal/month to month rainfall variations over India.'

Abstract: 'Quantifying groundwater recharge is a fundamental part of groundwater resource assessment and management, and is requisite to determining the safe yield of an aquifer. Natural groundwater recharge in arid and semi-arid regions comprises several mechanisms: in-place, mountain-front, and mountain-block recharge. A field study was undertaken in a high-plain basin in the Altiplano region of northern Chile to quantify the magnitude of in-place and mountain-front recharge. Water fluxes corresponding to both recharge mechanisms were calculated using heat as a natural tracer. To quantify in-place recharge, time-series temperature data in cased boreholes were collected, and the annual fluctuation at multiple depths analyzed to infer the water flux through the unsaturated zone. To quantify mountain-front recharge, time-series temperature data were collected in perennial and ephemeral stream channels. Streambed thermographs were analyzed to determine the onset and duration of flow in ephemeral channels, and the vertical water fluxes into both perennial and ephemeral channels. The point flux estimates in streambeds and the unsaturated zone were upscaled to channel and basin-floor areas to provide comparative estimates of the range of volumetric recharge rates corresponding to each recharge mechanism. The results of this study show that mountain-front recharge is substantially more important than in-place recharge in this basin. The results further demonstrate the worth of time-series subsurface temperature data to characterize both in-place and mountain-front recharge processes.'

Abstract: 'We have found a novel fungal genus that produces extremely bioactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This fungal isolate was initially discovered as an endophyte in Cinnamomum zeylanicum in a botanical garden in Honduras. This endophytic fungus, Muscodor albus, produces a mixture of VOCs that are lethal to a wide variety of plant and human pathogenic fungi and bacteria. It is also effective against nematodes and certain insects. The mixture of VOCs has been analyzed using GC/MS and consists primarily of various alcohols, acids, esters, ketones, and lipids. Final verification of the identity of the VOCs was carried out by using artificial mixtures of the putatively identified compounds and showing that the artificial mixture possessed the identical retention times and mass spectral qualities as those of the fungal derived substances. Artificial mixtures of the VOCs nicely mimicked the biological effects of the fungal VOCs when tested against a wide range of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Potential applications for \xe2\x80\x9cmycofumigation\xe2\x80\x9d by M. albus are currently being investigated and include uses for treating various plant parts, and human wastes. Another promising option includes its use to replace methyl bromide fumigation as a means to control soil-borne plant diseases.'

Abstract: 'High variation in seed size, as is common among angiosperms, may be maintained in a plant species when several factors select for seed size. Variation may also result from differences among adult plants, such as nutrient and water availability or the amount of photosynthetic tissue. In a study of Sabal palmetto seed ecology I found high seed size variation both within- and among-palms, and investigated possible factors maintaining this variation. Seed size was positively correlated with the number of leaves on parent palms. Larger seeds produced more vigorous seedlings that had greater leaf length, area, and mass, and greater root mass. Caryobruchus gleditsiae (Bruchidae: Coleoptera), whose larvae develop within palm seeds, preferentially oviposited on larger seeds, which in turn produced larger beetle offspring. By choosing the largest seeds available, ovipositing beetles thus affect both the quantity and the quality of seeds available for recruitment. I conclude that because beetle predation selects against large seeds, while larger seeds promote seedling vigor, the maintenance of seed size variation may be an adaptation of S. palmetto promoting both seed escape from predators and seedling vigor.'

Abstract: 'The Fortuna oxidized gold skarn deposit is located in the northern part of the Nambija gold district, southern Ecuador. It has been subdivided into four mineralized sites, covering a distance of 1\xc2\xa0km, which are named from north to south: Cuerpo 3, Mine 1, Mine 2, and Southern Sector. Massive skarn bodies occur in K\xe2\x80\x93Na metasomatized volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Triassic Piuntza unit. They appear to result from selective replacement of volcaniclastic rocks. Very minor presence of bioclast relicts suggests the presence of subordinate limestone. Endoskarn type alteration with development of Na-rich plagioclase, K-feldspar, epidote, actinolite, anhedral pyroxene, and titanite affects a quartz\xe2\x80\x93diorite porphyritic intrusion which crops out below the skarn bodies in Mine 2 and the Southern Sector. Endoskarn alteration in the intrusion grades into a K-feldspar \xc2\xb1 biotite \xc2\xb1 magnetite assemblage (K-alteration), suggesting that skarn formation is directly related to the quartz\xe2\x80\x93diorite porphyritic intrusion, the latter being probably emplaced between 141 and 146\xc2\xa0Ma. The massive skarn bodies were subdivided into a dominant brown garnet skarn, a distal green pyroxene\xe2\x80\x93epidote skarn, and two quartz-rich varieties, a blue-green garnet skarn and light green pyroxene\xe2\x80\x93garnet skarn, which occur as patches and small bodies within the former skarn types. The proximal massive brown garnet skarn zone is centered on two 060\xc2\xb0 trending faults in Mine 2, where the highest gold grades (5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0g/t) were observed. It grades into a distal green pyroxene\xe2\x80\x93epidote skarn zone to the North (Cuerpo 3). Granditic garnet shows iron enrichment from the proximal to the distal zone. Diopsidic pyroxene exhibits iron and manganese enrichment from proximal to distal zones. The retrograde stage is weakly developed and consists mainly of mineral phases filling centimeter-wide veins, vugs, and interstices between garnet and pyroxene grains. The main filling mineral is quartz, followed by K-feldspar, epidote, calcite, and chlorite, with minor sericite, apatite, titanite, hematite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and gold. Metal and sulfur contents are low at Fortuna, and the highest gold grades coincide with high hematite abundance, which suggests that retrograde stage and gold deposition took place under oxidizing conditions. Fluid inclusions from pyroxene indicate precipitation from high temperature\xe2\x80\x94high to moderate salinity fluids (400 to 460\xc2\xb0C and 54- to 13-wt% eq. NaCl), which result probably from boiling of a moderately saline (\xe2\x88\xbc8-wt% eq. NaCl) magmatic fluid. Later cooler (180 to 475\xc2\xb0C) and moderate to low saline fluids (1- to 20-wt% eq. NaCl) were trapped in garnet, epidote, and quartz, and are interpreted to be responsible for gold deposition. Chlorite analysis indicates temperature of formation between 300 and 340\xc2\xb0C in accordance with fluid inclusion data. It appears, thus, that gold was transported as chloride complexes under oxidizing conditions and was deposited at temperatures around 300\xc2\xb0C when transport of chloride complexes as gold carriers is not efficient.'

Abstract: 'Undulations in weather patterns have caused climate shifts of increased frequency and duration around the world. The need for additional research and model data on this pressing problem has resulted in a plethora of research groups examining a particular tree species or biome for negative effects of climate change. This review aims to (1) collect and merge recent research data on regeneration within old- and new-growth forests, (2) highlight and expand upon selected topics for additional discussion, and (3) report how shade tolerance, drought tolerance, and inherent plasticity affect tree growth and development. Although shade and drought tolerance have been well studied by a number of research groups, this review reveals that in-depth analysis of a single or a few species in a given area will not generate the data required to implement a successful regeneration plan. Studies using historical accounts of previous species composition, information regarding site seasonality, species competition, and individual responses to drought and shade are needed to (1) develop best management plans and (2) ensure future modeling experiments are focused on a greater variety of species using more innovative methods to evaluate climate change effects.'

Abstract: 'Water deficit in arid and semiarid regions affects whole-plant sap flow and leaf-level water relations. The objectives of this study were to clarify how sap flow of Calligonum arborescens responds to different drought stress conditions and to understand its acclimation mechanism to drought environments. A field experiment was conducted for C. arborescens during the growing season to evaluate the effects of deficit irrigation on the daily and seasonal variations of trunk sap flow in the shelterbelt along the Tarim Desert Highway, Xinjiang, China. Three different water regimes (2,380, 1,960 and 1,225 m3/hm2) were applied at different stages of plant growth. From 1 May to 30 October 2007, a heat-balance stem flow gauge was used to monitor the sap flow dynamics of C. arborescens under different water regimes. Atmospheric evaporation demand and soil moisture conditions for differentially irrigated C. arborescens were also monitored. The result showed that sap flow exhibited a clear diurnal pattern regardless of treatments; the diurnal patterns of sap flow and vapour pressure deficit were very similar under different water regimes and growing seasons, while the slope of the linear regression of this correlation confirmed an increasing water regime. The sap flow decreased under reduced water regimes and there was nocturnal sap flow regardless of water regimes, which was mainly contributed to nocturnal transpiration and water recharge. The sap flow peaked before midnight and dropped afterwards with obviously higher values in summer than in other seasons. It is speculated that the water consumption of C. arborescens during the day can be supplemented through the sap flow at night, which increased with increasing irrigation amount. Net radiation was the most significant correlated factor that influenced sap flow velocity and transpiration under different water regimes (R 2>0.719). Compared with the commonly practiced water regime, the growth of C. arborescens was significantly slower in the stress deficit irrigation, but not significantly different from that in the moderate deficit irrigation. The moderate deficit irrigation would not affect the stability of the shelterbelt and was a more efficient use of water resources compared with the current watering amount.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines systematics at The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG), providing an historical backdrop but emphasizing the diversified skills of the modern systematist and some of the developments since the Garden\xe2\x80\x99s centennial. It reviews some of the factors making NYBG a world center for plant and fungal systematics, including some of the giants in its history, its almost matchless resources for conducting systematics research, some of the landmarks and benchmarks the Garden\xe2\x80\x99s systematists have produced, and some indicators that suggest the productivity is continuing apace at the very least. Some aspects of systematics research are unchanged or virtually so, but numerous dimensions and requisite skills have been added to the systematist\xe2\x80\x99s toolbox, such that graduate students in systematics are now expected to be \xe2\x80\x98masters of all trades.\xe2\x80\x99 Outreach and service to the scientific community and the public, including direct influence on conservation, comprise a significant portion of the modern systematist\xe2\x80\x99s activities. The staff and research projects of NYBG\xe2\x80\x99s systematists are remarkable for their geographic and phylogenetic \xe2\x80\x9ccoverage\xe2\x80\x9d: the Garden\xe2\x80\x99s geographic research programs are much more global than before, and the Garden has staff researching virtually all major groups of plants and fungi. Another remarkable feature of the Garden\xe2\x80\x99s team of systematists is that it has had staff working on several important taxonomic groups for many decades. Looking ahead to NYBG\xe2\x80\x99s 150th anniversary, the staff will be transformed and the botanist\xe2\x80\x99s toolkit will continue to expand rapidly, but the mission of documenting and conserving the plants and fungi of the world will remain the same.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry tree domestication research is geared at promoting diversification of on-farm tree species composition. A survey was conducted in western Kenya with the objective of exploring possibilities for diversification for a particular agroecosystem, involving a complete tree census, tree measurement and collection of ethnobotanical information in 201 small-scale farms. Various approaches to landscape diversification were explored, including random distribution of trees to increase alpha richness and species richness at higher scales in the landscape, and random distribution of species composition over villages to increase the average richness of villages. The results showed that random distribution would result in increments of average species richness in the landscape, without requiring increments of total and average abundance. A new, fast and exact method of calculating site-based species accumulation curves was presented. The method yielded results that were extremely close to classical algorithms using 10,000 randomisations. Four use-groups (beverage, fodder, charcoal and soil fertility enhancement) were identified as use-groups with alpha richness smaller than one species, but only beverage and fodder had lowest richness at all scales (fruit and construction wood joined the four use-groups of lowest average species richness at higher scales in the landscape). The novel approaches used in this study could be used in future biodiversity studies on species accumulation patterns, or on spatial distribution patterns of species richness in a landscape.'

Abstract: 'In order to observe the effect of forest loss on the leaf litter ant fauna in Ghana, West Africa, samples were taken in primary forest, secondary forest and in cocoa plots. Ants were extracted from the leaf litter by sieving followed by suspension in Winkler bags. The species composition and species richness in the three different habitats were compared and no significant difference was found between them. It was concluded that most primary forest leaf litter ant species continue to survive in parts of the agricultural landscape which has largely replaced their original habitat.'

Abstract: 'Leptospires can persist for months in nutrient-poor aqueous environments prior to transmission to a mammalian host. Interactions with environmental bacteria and biofilm formation are possible mechanisms of persistence of leptospires in the environment. Bacteria isolated from rivers in the Ecuadorian rainforest were tested for their ability to support leptospiral viability. We found that co-culture with Sphingomonas spp., but not Flavobacterium spp. or Delftia spp., enabled survival of L. biflexa and L. meyeri for up to a year in distilled water. We also found that L. interrogans biofilms formed in distilled water contained viable organisms that rapidly dispersed into the planktonic phase in the presence of nutrients in serum or EMJH medium. These data inform our understanding of leptospiral survival strategies that enable long-term persistence in nutrient-poor conditions yet allow rapid mobilization when nutrients become available.'

Abstract: 'A shift in colony founding behaviour from single queen (haplometrosis) to multiple queens (pleometrosis) was observed locally in the obligate plant-ant Crematogaster (Decacrema) morphospecies 2, which is associated with Macaranga trees in Borneo. In addition, about a quarter of all mature colonies (27 of 95 trees examined) were found to be multiple queen colonies. They arose either directly from pleometrotic founding colonies or secondarily by adoption of additional queens. Using microsatellite markers, we showed that queens in colonies founded through pleometrosis are unrelated and each queen participates in producing worker offspring, albeit with significant skew in a third of the colonies. In mature polygynous colonies, all resident queens contributed to the production of workers and sexual offspring. Relatedness of queens in mature polygynous colonies was not significantly higher than in foundress associations. We hypothesize that increased nest site limitation in this specific interaction trigger the observed shift in colony founding behaviour. Crematogaster msp. 2 inhabits the light demanding pioneer plant species Macaranga pearsonii that is typical for early successional stages of secondary forests. Thus suitable host-plants for colonisation are abundant for only a short time in highly disturbed sites and become increasingly sparse when secondary forest matures.'

Abstract: 'Most research on carbon content of trees has focused on temperate species, with less information existing for tropical trees and very little for tropical plantations. This study investigated factors affecting the carbon content of nineteen tropical plantation tree species of ages seven to twelve and compared carbon content of Khaya species from two ecozones in Ghana. For all sample trees, volume of the main stem, wood density, wood carbon (C) concentration and C content were determined. Estimated stem volume for the 12-year-old trees varied widely among species, from 0.01 to 1.04\xc2\xa0m3, with main stem C content ranging from 3 to 205\xc2\xa0kg. Wood density among species varied from 0.27 to 0.76\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x88\x923, with faster growing species exhibiting lower density. Significant differences in wood density also occurred with position along the main stem. Carbon concentration also differed among tree species, ranging from 458 to 498\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921. Differences among species in main stem C content largely reflected differences among species in estimated main stem volume, with values modified somewhat by wood density and C concentration. The use of species-specific wood density values was more important for ensuring accurate conversion of estimated stem volumes to C content than was the use of species-specific C concentrations. Significant differences in wood density did exist between Khaya species from the wet and moist semi-deciduous ecozones, suggesting climatic and site factors may also need to be considered. Wood densities for these plantation grown trees were lower than literature values reported for the same species in natural forests, suggesting that the application of data derived from natural forests could result in overestimation of the biomass and C content of trees of the same species grown in plantations.'

Abstract: 'The sandfly, Phlebotomus duboscqi is a vector of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) that is an important public health problem in Eastern Africa. Repellents have been used for protection of humans against vectors of ZCL and other vectors that transmit killer diseases including malaria, Rift Valley fever, dengue, and yellow fever. The repellent effects of different doses of the essential oils from the lemon grass, Cymbopogon citratus and Mexican marigold, Tagetes minuta were evaluated in a two-chamber bioassay against 3- to 7-day-old unfed females of P. duboscqi in the laboratory. The results were compared with those that were obtained when test animals were treated with an equivalent dose of diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, which is a repellent that is commonly used as a positive control.'

Abstract: 'It has been estimated that plants are the most important source of medicine for more than 80% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population. Medicinal plants are a vital source of medication in developing countries. Despite the wealth of human experience and folklore concerning the medicinal uses of plants, proper scientific investigation has only been applied to a small fraction of the world\xe2\x80\x99s plants. This is a cause of grave concern as plant species continue to disappear. A rapid response to this situation is urgently needed to prevent the disappearance of the plant species and the ethnopharmacological knowledge that accompanies them. In this review, recent work on the investigation of selected bioactive Thai medicinal plants is presented. Their biological activities against infectious diseases including antimalarial and anti-HIV, are highlighted, as well as their anticancer, antiulcer and anti-inflammatory properties. The chemical transformations of some selected compounds are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Understanding processes affecting the distribution and abundance of organisms is a central issue in ecology and conservation biology. In northwestern Madagascar, we found an uneven distribution pattern of the golden-brown mouse lemur (Microcebus ravelobensis) and the grey mouse lemur (M. murinus). In one area (JBA) the two species lived sympatrically, whereas in another forest area (JBB) Microcebus ravelobensis occurred exclusively. To investigate whether differences in forest structure may explain this uneven distribution, we conducted a microhabitat analysis and related it to specific distribution. In JBA the habitat of Microcebus ravelobensis was characterized by a higher percentage of trees with many lianas and a higher cover of the herb layer, whereas that of M. murinus had a higher number of trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >10 cm. The comparison of the forest structure of the microhabitats of the two species between JBA and JBB revealed further differences. The cover of the overstory, the percentage of trees without lianas and the number of larger trees (DBH >10 cm) among the microhabitats were higher for Microcebus murinus in JBA than for M. ravelobensis in JBB whereas the microhabitats of M. ravelobensis at the two sites did not differ concerning these vegetation structures. Differences between the two species coincide with those of resources important for survival. Our results indicate the importance of microhabitat analyses for the understanding of distribution patterns of species and for successful conservation planning.'

Abstract: 'Tropical deforestation is well known to have serious negative consequences for biodiversity, terrestrial carbon sinks and the balance of atmospheric greenhouse gases. By contrast, selective logging of tropical forests is often regarded as having a lesser impact on the ecosystem particularly in long terms, even though there have been few critical evaluations of the practice, particularly in Africa. We compared field data from 511 plots in the tropical forest of Sierra Leone, Ghana, Cameroon and Gabon. These plots were subject to different forest management practices: no recent logging (primary forests), selective logging (up to 30\xc2\xa0years old) and re-grown secondary forests post clear-cutting (at least 20\xc2\xa0years ago). Our findings suggest that the vertical structure and plant richness of the selectively logged and secondary forests change in different amplitude from those of primary forests, but stem density and the prevalence of vine and weed species differ greatly. We show that the effects of selective logging are greater than those expected simply from the removal of commercial species, and can persist for decades. Selective logging, unless it is practiced at very low harvest intensities, can significantly reduce the biomass of a tropical forest for many decades, seriously diminishing aboveground carbon storage capacity, and create opportunities for weeds and vines to spread and slow down the ecological succession.'

Abstract: 'Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) are ecosystems particularly sensitive to climate change; however, the effects of warmer and drier conditions on TMCF ecohydrology remain poorly understood. To investigate functional responses of TMCF trees to reduced water availability, we conducted a study during the 2014 dry season in the lower altitudinal limit of TMCF in central Veracruz, Mexico. Temporal variations of transpiration, depth of water uptake and tree water sources were examined for three dominant, brevi-deciduous species using micrometeorological, sap flow and soil moisture measurements, in combination with oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of rainfall, tree xylem, soil and stream water. Over the course of the dry season, reductions in crown conductance and transpiration were observed in canopy species (43 and 34%, respectively) and mid-story trees (23 and 8%), as atmospheric demand increased and soil moisture decreased. Canopy species consistently showed more depleted isotope values compared to mid-story trees. However, MixSIAR Bayesian model results showed that the evaporated (enriched) soil water pool was the main source for trees despite reduced soil moisture. Additionally, while increases in tree water uptake from deeper to shallower soil water sources occurred, concomitant decreases in transpiration were observed as the dry season progressed. A larger reduction in deep soil water use was observed for canopy species (from 79\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8919 to 24\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8920%) compared to mid-story trees (from 12\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8917 to 10\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8912%). The increase in shallower soil water sources may reflect a trade-off between water and nutrient requirements in this forest.'

Abstract: 'The Neotropical ovenbird-woodcreeper family (Furnariidae) is an avian group characterized by exceptionally diverse ecomorphological adaptations. For instance, members of the family are known to construct nests of a remarkable variety. This offers a unique opportunity to examine whether changes in nest design, accompanied by expansions into new habitats, facilitates diversification. We present a multi-gene phylogeny and age estimates for the ovenbird-woodcreeper family and use these results to estimate the degree of convergent evolution in both phenotype and habitat utilisation. Furthermore, we discuss whether variation in species richness among ovenbird clades could be explained by differences in clade-specific diversification rates, and whether these rates differ among lineages with different nesting habits. In addition, the systematic positions of some enigmatic ovenbird taxa and the postulated monophyly of some species-rich genera are evaluated.'

Abstract: 'Digital elevation model (DEM) derived conventionally from topographic maps and space borne satellites will provide various evidences about the change in earth features. It is one of the most fundamental data source of topographical relief information and delineate watershed boundaries which is being widely applied in numerous hydrological studies. A significant amount of work has been done to address the limitation and uncertainties of DEM. This review article aimed to bring all-inclusive considerations of DEM, i.e., derivative DEM sensors, types, accessibility, cost, horizontal & vertical accuracy and cell resolution. Based on evaluation this study would offer a good assistance to the research community and users for the implication of DEM services in appropriate hydrological models to avoid the ambiguities of modeling.'

Abstract: 'Light partitioning is thought to contribute to the coexistence of rain forest tree species. This study evaluates the three premises underlying the light partitioning hypothesis; 1) there is a gradient in light availability at the forest floor, 2) tree species show a differential distribution with respect to light, and 3) there is a trade-off in species performance that explains their different positions along the light gradient. To address these premises, we studied the light environment, growth, and survival of saplings of ten non-pioneer tree species in a Bolivian moist forest. Light availability in the understorey was relatively high, with a mean canopy openness of 3.5% and a mean direct site factor of 6.8%. Saplings of two light demanding species occurred at significantly higher light levels than the shade tolerant species. The proportion of saplings in low-light conditions was negatively correlated with the successional position of the species. Light-demanding species were characterised by a low share of their saplings in low-light conditions, a high sapling mortality, a fast height growth and a strong growth response to light. These data show that all three premises for light partitioning are met. There is a clear gradient in shade-tolerance within the group of non-pioneer species leading to a tight packing of species along the small range of light environments found in the understorey.'

Abstract: 'The creation of riparian forest buffer zones for water quality management in agricultural landscapes takes land out of production, incurring an economic loss for the landowner. However, planting and harvesting techniques, such as those employed in indigenous systems of tropical agroforestry, can enhance riparian forest buffer strips with economically viable species. This kind of riparian forest buffer can be harvested and generate income from otherwise unproductive tracts of land. This practice would make the implementation of riparian forest buffers more acceptable to farmers, by generating income while helping to improve water quality. The present project provides an economic model for the harvest of non-timber products (fruits, nuts and ornamentals) from riparian forest buffer zones in the Chesapeake Bay region. Potential gross income from harvest is calculated to demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy. Given certain assumptions, the gross income can amount to $60,934.30/ha/year.'

Abstract: 'Our growing humankind needs fertile soils for its sustainable development. Population growth and related use of resources, jointly with environmental pollution seem to contradict that demand. Recently available geochemical atlases allow for a better assessment of representative soil chemistry and potential pollution status, and thus for more efficient planning and development.'

Abstract: '\nA basin-scale hydrologic-energy balance model that integrates modern climatological, hydrological, and hypsographic observations was developed for the modern Lake Titicaca watershed (northern Altiplano, South America) and operated under variable conditions to understand controls on post-glacial changes in lake level. The model simulates changes in five environmental variables (air temperature, cloud fraction, precipitation, relative humidity, and land surface albedo). Relatively small changes in three meteorological variables (mean annual precipitation, temperature, and/or cloud fraction) explain the large mid-Holocene lake-level decrease (\xe2\x88\xbc85\xc2\xa0m) inferred from seismic reflection profiling and supported by sediment-based paleoproxies from lake sediments. Climatic controls that shape the present-day Altiplano and the sediment-based record of Holocene lake-level change are combined to interpret model-derived lake-level simulations in terms of changes in the mean state of ENSO and its impact on moisture transport to the Altiplano.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity assessment for tree species was conducted in three forest fragments ofthe Taita Hills, southeastern Kenya to compare species diversity between and within three exotic forest plantations of pine, eucalyptus, cypress and the indigenous forests. The study sites were: Ngangao (120 ha), Chawia (86 ha), and Mbololo (185 ha). A Y-plot design was used to sample 32 plots comprising of 65 subplots. At each subplot, all juvenile trees of 5 cm and above in diameter at breast height (DBH) were enumerated and recorded by species. Tree regeneration (seedlings and saplings) was tallied by species. The Shannon-Weiner Index was used to calculate species diversity and evenness. The derived Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s indices were further converted into effective numbers to show the magnitude of differences in species biodiversities. To evaluate differences in species diversities, a one way ANOVA was conducted and to separate the means, Tukey\xe2\x80\x99s HSD and Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s tests were used for even and uneven number of samples respectively. Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s similarity index was used to assess species similarities. There were more than 58 species whose stem densities varied between 10 and 2 000 trees per hectare. There were significant differences in species diversities between forest types and sites; the indigenous forests showed higher diversities than the exotic forests. Similarly, Chawia sites had higher species diversity than both Ngangao and Mbololo. Chawia also had a higher number of regenerated species than the two other sites, including species such as Xymalos monospora, Rapanea melanophloeos, and Syzygium guineense, which are associated with low levels of disturbance. These findings indicate that the indigenous forest is more diverse in species as would be expected in the tropics. The high species diversity in Chawia could be accounted for by the higher levels of disturbance it underwent, unlike the two other sites. The regeneration of species associated with low levels of disturbance found in the exotic plots of Chawia show the likelihood of presence of long-term soil seed banks. The low regeneration in the exotics plots observed in Ngangao and Mbololo are likely due to the absence of seed banks since some of the plantations were established on bare land (in Ngango), or the inherent physiology (allelopathy) of some of species repelling the regeneration of others.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents the results of studying a promising area related to the remote assessment of canopy spaces in forests by thresholding methods of image segmentation. The study is conducted based on the example of mixed forests in the Losiny Ostrov National Park. The proposed methodological approach to assessing the pattern of forest canopy on super-high (detailed) resolution satellite images is based on an analysis of light and shaded plots of canopy spaces using image-thresholding algorithms.'

Abstract: 'The neotropical rust fungus Prospodium tuberculatum was released in Australia in 2001 for the classical biological control of the invasive alienweed Lantana camara, following a risk assessment that included studies on its life-cycle, infection parameters and host range. This paper reports on the first two research areas. This rust is recorded as autoecious and microcyclic (urediniospores and teliospores only) in the literature, but the role of the teliospores had not been demonstrated. Extensive field surveys reported here found the rust to cycle solely through urediniospores on L. camara throughout most of its native range. However, at the high altitude extremes of its range, the rust has retained its ability to over-winter as teliospores. Attempts to clarify the function of the basidiospores and the conditions necessary to induce teliospore formation were unsuccessful under controlled conditions. A hypothesised connection between P. tuberculatum and Aecidium lantanae was rejected after DNAanalysis. Investigations on spore storage showed that teliospores and urediniospores can survive for extended periods in liquid nitrogen. Glasshousebased studies demonstrated that the urediniospores have wide temperature tolerance (10\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0C) for infection of L. camara, with an optimum near to 20\xc2\xb0C. The minimum dew period requirement for plant infection was 9 h with the optimum close to 15 h.'

Abstract: 'The review sums up research conducted at CIAT within a multidiscipline effort revolving around a strategy for developing improved technologies to increase and sustain cassava productivity, as well as conserving natural resources in the various eco-edaphic zones where the crop is grown, with emphasis on stressful environments. Field research has elucidated several physiological plant mechanisms underlying potentially high productivity under favourable hot-humid environments in the tropics. Most notable is cassava inherent high capacity to assimilate carbon in near optimum environments that correlates with both biological productivity and root yield across a wide range of germplasm grown in diverse environments. Cassava leaves possess elevated activities of the C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) that also correlate with leaf net photosynthetic rate (P N) in field-grown plants, indicating the importance of selection for high P N. Under certain conditions such leaves exhibit an interesting photosynthetic C3-C4 intermediate behaviour which may have important implications in future selection efforts. In addition to leaf P N, yield is correlated with seasonal mean leaf area index (i.e. leaf area duration, LAD). Under prolonged water shortages in seasonally dry and semiarid zones, the crop, once established, tolerates stress and produces reasonably well compared to other food crops (e.g. in semiarid environments with less than 700 mm of annual rain, improved cultivars can yield over 3 t ha\xe2\x88\x921 oven-dried storage roots). The underlying mechanisms for such tolerance include stomatal sensitivity to atmospheric and edaphic water deficits, coupled with deep rooting capacities that prevent severe leaf dehydration, i.e. stress avoidance mechanisms, and reduced leaf canopy with reasonable photosynthesis over the leaf life span. Another stress-mitigating plant trait is the capacity to recover from stress, once water is available, by forming new leaves with even higher P N, compared to those in nonstressed crops. Under extended stress, reductions are larger in shoot biomass than in storage root, resulting in higher harvest indices. Cassava conserves water by slowly depleting available water from deep soil layers, leading to higher seasonal crop water-use and nutrient-use efficiencies. In dry environments LAD and resistance to pests and diseases are critical for sustainable yields. In semiarid zones the crop survives but requires a second wet cycle to achieve high yields and high dry matter contents in storage roots. Selection and breeding for early bulking and for medium/short-stemmed cultivars is advantageous under semiarid conditions. When grown in cooler zones such as in tropical high altitudes and in low-land sub-tropics, leaf P N is greatly reduced and growth is slower. Thus, the crop requires longer period for a reasonable productivity. There is a need to select and breed for more cold-tolerant genotypes. Selection of parental materials for tolerance to water stress and infertile soils has resulted in breeding improved germplasm adapted to both favourable and stressful environments.'

Abstract: 'Species of the Theobroma genus are primarily known by their commercially valuable seeds, especially, T. cacao is one of the most important tropical perennial crops. Beside T. grandiflorum, T. bicolor, and T. angustifolium, T. cacao is the only species of the genus that has been better studied to obtain physiologically relevant information. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the leaf gas exchange in seedlings of seven species of the Theobroma genus, seeking to identify characteristics that could be used in T. cacao breeding programmes. The study was realized under greenhouse conditions using six-month-old seedlings, in which net photosynthetic rate (P N), stomatal conductance (g s), transpiration (E), as well as parameters derived from light curves (P N vs. photosynthetically active radiation) were evaluated. T. cacao, along with T. microcarpum, showed the lowest values of P N, g s, and E, while the highest values were presented by T. speciosum, which showed higher saturation irradiance and lower intrinsic and instantaneous water-use efficiencies, being considered the species less conservative in water use. Therefore, the parameters shown by the different evaluated species could serve to design T. cacao genotypes, through introgression of genes for specific environments such as the cabruca system widespread in southern Bahia, Brazil.'

Abstract: 'Brazil is a major producer of agro-industrial residues, such as sugarcane bagasse, which could be used as raw material for microbial production of cellulases as an important strategy for the development of sustainable processes of second generation ethanol production. For this purpose, this work aimed at screening for glycosyl hydrolase activities of fungal strains isolated from the Brazilian Cerrado. Among 13 isolates, a Trichoderma harzianum strain (L04) was identified as a promising candidate for cellulase production when cultured on in natura sugarcane bagasse. Strain L04 revealed a well-balanced cellulolytic complex, presenting fast kinetic production of endoglucanases, exoglucanases and \xce\xb2-glucosidases, achieving 4,022, U.L-1 (72\xc2\xa0h), 1,228 U.L-1 (120\xc2\xa0h) and 1,968 U.L-1 (48\xc2\xa0h) as the highest activities, respectively. About 60% glucose yields were obtained from sugarcane bagasse after 18\xc2\xa0hours hydrolysis. This new strain represents a potential candidate for on-site enzyme production using sugarcane bagasse as carbon source.'

Abstract: 'As upland farmers in Southeast Asia change from shifting cultivation to permanent agriculture and lose access to swidden-fallow forests and their resources, they are introducing economically important forest and fallow plants into their house gardens. We describe this process in Daka, a village of Hani ethnicity in Yunnan Province, China. Daka smallholders collect both seeds and seedlings from fallow forests and transfer the plants to house gardens, initiating the transformation of wild species to a cultivated or semi-domesticated one. Two kinds of species are commonly transferred from swidden fallows to house gardens. Some are particularly rare, others are plants in great demand. Between 1998 and 2000 Daka households earned an average of US$68.20 annually from the products of fallow forests. We also found that villagers harvest and use 76 plant species from fallow forests and 126 species from house gardens. Twenty-two species found in house gardens that had been transferred from fallow forests. Households vary widely in the frequency with which they engage in this pattern. We believe that local knowledge of these practices is a potentially important resource in the development of other areas of smallholder farming.'

Abstract: 'The main objective of this paper is to suggest an alternative approach for the investigation of domestication in the Levant. First, basic data regarding domestication in the Levant are presented. Then the various traditional approaches towards domestication in the prehistoric Levant, labeled (1) environmental, (2) social and anthropological, and (3) cognitive, are briefly reviewed. This discussion forms the basis for a proposal of a \xe2\x80\x9cholistic approach,\xe2\x80\x9d in which domestication is regarded as a long-term, multidimensional and multirelational phenomenon, including many elements\xe2\x80\x94such as plants, animals, humans, material culture and ancestors\xe2\x80\x94with increasing human manipulation of these various constituents. After a presentation of the theoretical framework, a growth metaphor is used to reconstruct the process of domestication (ca. 20,000\xe2\x80\x936500 B.P.) as a number of phases: (1) germination in the Kebaran; (2) development in the Early Natufian; (3) retreat/dormancy in the Late/Final Natufian; (4) growth in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A; (5) florescence in the Early- and Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B: (6) further development in the Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B; (7) dispersal in the Final Pre-Pottery Neolithic B and the Pottery Neolithic. In each of these phases, relations between the various elements are dealt with, special attention being paid to symbolical relations, as evidenced by \xe2\x80\x9cart\xe2\x80\x9d and ritual.'

Abstract: 'New particle formation (NPF) has been expected to be less favored in the polluted atmosphere than in the clean atmosphere. However, highly polluted regions in developing countries like China and India are becoming hot spots of NPF. Understanding nucleation and growth mechanisms of aerosol particles in polluted environments have important implications in their global climate impact and health effect. This paper reviewed recent publications from atmospheric field and laboratory measurements under conditions relevant to the polluted atmosphere. NPF probability in polluted environments was discussed by exploring the uncertainties in coagulation sink and growth rate estimations. Future directions and challenges in understanding NPF in highly polluted environments are presented.'

Abstract: 'Griffinia alba was described in 2000 from a collection made in the 1930s, which remained the only known material of the species until recently. In 2014, two new records of the species from one of the most deforested regions of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest were discovered. This discovery revealed that the original description of G. alba was partially incorrect and lacking in certain important diagnostic features. In this article, we present an updated description of G. alba, plus a more detailed illustration and the first in-vivo photos of the species. Additionally, comments are provided on the species\xe2\x80\x99 geographic distribution, conservation status, and putative relationships. Two other species names based on unicate types collected in the nineteenth century are found to be synonyms of G. alba.

Abstract: 'Since the publication of the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007, the securitization of global warming has reached a new level. Numerous public statements and a growing research literature have discussed the potential security risks and conflicts associated with climate change. This article provides an overview of this debate and introduces an assessment framework of climate stress, human security and societal impacts. Key fields of conflict will be addressed, including water stress, land use and food security, natural disasters and environmental migration. A few regional hot spots of climate security will be discussed, such as land-use conflicts in Northern Africa; floods, sea-level rise and human security in Southern Asia; glacier melting and water insecurity in Central Asia and Latin America; water conflicts in the Middle East; climate security in the Mediterranean; and the potential impact on rich countries. Finally, concepts and strategies will be considered to minimize the security risks and move from conflict to cooperation in climate policy.'

Abstract: ' Several theories have been proposed to explain the raised richness and diversity of species in native tropical forests, with an emphasis on those that invoke the niche characteristics. In the present study, we sample the woody vegetation in four enclaves of Deciduous Forests and investigate whether environmental variables can explain the floristic and structural differences among the sampled fragments. The studied areas are located the \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d biome core zone and in \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x93Atlantic Forest and \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x93Caatinga\xe2\x80\x9d transition zones. The woody vegetation (diameter at breast height\xe2\x80\x94DBH\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0cm) was sampled in 100 plots of 20\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0m, 25 plots in each enclaves. The investigated environmental variables were chemical and textural properties of the soil, rockiness, declivity and altitude. We found significant differences for the floristic variables (richness, diversity), among all the environmental variables, as well as for the density, height and for the DBH first class. We noticed strong influence of the environmental variables, and the nutrients availability, texture, soil acidity and the land relief are the most responsible for the floristic-cultural difference. We propose that the gradient existence of rainfall has influenced the edaphic characteristics, creating variations in the habitats, which may have favored the arrival and establishment of different species in each study area and the distinctive development of the woody vegetation at the enclaves to the Deciduous Forest.'

Abstract: 'We examined seasonal and spatial patterns in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Chowan River watershed, North Carolina, a blackwater river which discharges into the second largest estuary in the United States, the Albemarle\xe2\x80\x93Pamlico Estuarine System. From April 2008 to May 2010, DOC concentration did not significantly vary across seasons (range 7.69\xe2\x80\x9330.39\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921); however, CDOM molecular size and aromaticity increased throughout the spring, decreased during the summer and fall, and remained relatively low in the winter. Spectral slope ratios suggested microbial processing of CDOM in the spring and photodegradation of CDOM in the summer and fall. Spatially, DOC and CDOM concentrations were similar in the mainstem and at the mouths of two tributaries, Bennetts Creek and Wiccacon River, but were significantly higher upstream on the tributaries. DOC concentration was positively correlated with CDOM absorbance coefficients at 254 and 350\xc2\xa0nm; however, these optical proxies explained only ~60\xc2\xa0% of the variance. DOC and CDOM absorption loads to the Albemarle Sound ranged from 2.63\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01010\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 and 9.84\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01010\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, respectively, in a dry year and 7.9\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01010\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 and 2.2\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01011\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, respectively, in a wet year, which are comparable to non-blackwater rivers with larger watersheds. Blackwater rivers may therefore represent \xe2\x80\x9chotspots\xe2\x80\x9d in coastal carbon chemistry, with seasonal variations in the quality and quantity of DOC and CDOM influencing estuarine food web dynamics and net ecosystem metabolism.'

Abstract: 'Climate geoengineering proposals seek to rectify the current radiative imbalance via either (1) reducing incoming solar radiation (solar radiation management) or (2) removing CO2 from the atmosphere and transferring it to long-lived reservoirs (carbon dioxide removal). For each option, we discuss its effectiveness and potential side effects, also considering lifetime of effect, development and deployment timescale, reversibility, and failure risks. We present a detailed review that builds on earlier work by including the most recent literature, and is more extensive than previous comparative frameworks. Solar radiation management propsals are most effective but short-lived, whilst carbon dioxide removal measures gain effectiveness the longer they are pursued. Solar radiation management could restore the global radiative balance, but must be maintained to avoid abrupt warming, meanwhile ocean acidification and residual regional climate changes would still occur. Carbon dioxide removal involves less risk, and offers a way to return to a pre-industrial CO2 level and climate on a millennial timescale, but is potentially limited by the CO2 storage capacity of geological reservoirs. Geoengineering could complement mitigation, but it is not an alternative to it. We expand on the possible combinations of mitigation, carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management that might be used to avoid dangerous climate change.'

Abstract: 'Anopheles pseudopunctipennis is an important malaria vector in the Neotropical region and the only species involved in Plasmodium transmission in the Andean foothills. Its wide geographical distribution in America, high preference for biting humans and capacity to rest inside dwellings after feeding, are attributes contributing to its vector status. Previous reports have tried to elucidate its taxonomic status, distinguishing populations from North, Central and South America. In the present study we used a mitochondrial marker to examine the demographic history of An. pseudopunctipennis in northwestern Argentina.'

Abstract: ' Hydraulic properties and gas exchange were measured in branches of two tropical tree species (Simarouba amara Aubl. and Tapirira guianensis Aubl.) in a moist lowland forest in Panama. Branch-level sapflow, leaf-level stomatal conductance, and water potential measurements, along with measurements of specific hydraulic conductivity of stems in crown tops, were used to relate hydraulic parameters to leaf conductance in two individuals of each species. Branches of the taller trees for each species (28\xc2\xa0m, 31\xc2\xa0m) showed much higher leaf-specific hydraulic conductance and leaf vapor-phase conductance than those of the smaller trees (18m, 23m). This was probably related to the leaf-to-sapwood area ratio in branches of taller trees, which was less than half that in branches of smaller trees. Dye staining showed evidence of massive cavitation in all trees, indicating that stomata do not control leaf water potential to prevent xylem cavitation in these species. Stomatal conductance of intact leaves also appeared to be insensitive to leaf area removal treatment of nearby foliage. Nevertheless, a simple mass-balance model of water flux combining hydraulic and vapor transport was in close agreement with observed maximal vapor-phase conductance in the four trees (r 2=0.98, P=0.006). Our results suggest that the major organismal control over water flux in these species is by structural (leaf area) rather than physiological (stomatal) means.'

Abstract: 'Authentic rehabilitation requires the active participation of patients and their involvement with opportunities for action and development. Within this framework, in this article we outline the possibility of using two emerging computing and communication technologies\xe2\x80\x94ambient intelligence (AmI) and virtual reality (VR)\xe2\x80\x94for a new breed of rehabilitative and clinical applications based on a strategy defined astransformation of flow. Transformation of flow is a person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to exploit an optimal (flow) experience to identify and use new and unexpected psychological resources as sources of involvement. We identify the feeling ofpresence\xe2\x80\x94the feeling of being in a world that exists outside oneself\xe2\x80\x94as the theoretical link between the technology and rehabilitation. AmI and VR are used to trigger broad empowerment processes induced by a strong sense of presence, leading to greater agency and control over one\xe2\x80\x99s actions and environment.'

Abstract: 'A cladistic analysis was conducted to test the monophyly of Eschweilera and Lecythis as well as to examine the relationships of these two genera and their close relatives Bertholletia and Corythophora. The study included 86 species, representing all four genera and covering the range of taxonomic and morphological variation in the genera. The data matrix included 49 parsimony-informative characters derived from vegetative, floral, fruit, and seed morphology and anatomy. The results based on the consensus of all most parsimonious trees indicate that Bertholletia, Corythophora, Eschweilera, and Lecythis form a clade supported by brachyparacytic stomata, the absence of pedicels (with subsequent reversals in several clades), a two or four-locular ovary, the presence of an aril, and the absence of cotyledons. Within the clade, the monophyly of Corythophora is supported by the presence of inflorescence scales and the absence of nectar. Eschweilera is monophyletic only if E. congestiflora and E. simiorum are excluded. The monophyly of Eschweilera is supported by the presence of a two-locular ovary. Lecythis is not monophyletic, but sections Corrugata, Pisonis, and Poiteaui are monophyletic. Three species of section Lecythis are more closely related to Eschweilera, and other species of section Lecythis along with Bertholletia excelsa remain as unresolved.'

Abstract: 'Extrafloral nectar of plants and honeydew of hemipterans is a food source extensively explored by ants. Although basically a sugary liquid food, nectar and honeydew are composed of different nutrients and offered in distinct ways; thus, ants must interact differently with plants and hemipterans. In this study we assessed the availability and dominance of nectar of extrafloral nectaries and honeydew of sap-sucking hemipterans (i.e., sugar-based resources) as mechanisms regulating interaction frequency and structuring ant-plant-hemipteran networks. We studied 12 plant species (240 shrubs, 20 per species) and 12 hemipteran species (240 aggregations, 20 per species) that interacted with 26 ant species in an area of Rupestrian Fields (Rocky Montane Savannah), Brazil. We observed that the 7 ant species that collected honeydew were a subset of the 25 ant species feeding on nectar, but the highly interacted species Camponotus crassus was the same for both subnetworks. The ant-plant subnetwork exhibited a nested pattern of interaction with a low degree of specialization, while the ant-hemipteran subnetwork exhibited lower nestedness but higher specialization. We found a positive relationship between the offer of EFNs and the number of interactions with ants, probably resulting from reduced competition in plants with high availability of EFNs. However, hemipteran species that were most abundant did not interact with more species of ants, probably because of the numerical dominance of the species tending  all hemipteran aggregations, regardless of size. However, segregation between ant species was higher than expected by chance for both plants and hemipterans, confirming a deterministic factor (i.e., competition between ant species) regulating the frequency of interactions. In summary, the availability of ENFs seems to be an important mechanism regulating ant-plant interactions, while numerical dominance seems to be an important mechanism structuring ant-hemipteran interactions.'

Abstract: 'The arthropod communities living on the bark of the oak species Quercus macrocarpa and Q. ellipsoidalis were investigated in a North American oak savanna. Differences were found in the community structure of the arthropods living on the bark of these two tree species, although they have the same fissured bark type. In the North American oak savanna ecosystem the most important disturbance factor is fire, which maintains species richness. Highest numbers of species and specimens were found at moderately disturbed sites. Three main ecological groups of arthropods living on the bark of trees can be distinguished in relation to the degree of disturbance: (1) Inhabitants of bark of trees restricted to undisturbed sites: they do not occur in fire-disturbed areas; (2) Inhabitants of bark of trees adapted to a moderate degree of disturbance: many species occur in high numbers only in moderately disturbed areas; and (3) Specialist inhabitants of bark of trees in heavily disturbed areas. The number of specimens of these species increases per trunk with the frequency of disturbance.'

Abstract: 'This work focuses on the optimization of cellulase production by two Trichoderma strains. A 24 full factorial design was used to evaluate the effects of four factors in the optimization of cellulase production (filter paper assay\xe2\x80\x94FPA): crude glycerol, microcrystalline cellulose, yeast extract and ammonium sulfate. In fermentation with Trichoderma CMIAT 054 strain the largest FPA (138.48 FPU\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) occurred with 25.0\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 of cellulose, 10.0\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 of crude glycerol, 1.4\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x891 of yeast extract and 3.5\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x891 of ammonium sulfate in the culture medium. In tests with Trichoderma CMIAT 041 strain the highest FPA (89.35 FPU\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) occurred with 25.0\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 of cellulose, 20.0\xc2\xa0g L\xe2\x88\x921 of crude glycerol, 0.6\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 of yeast extract and 1.5\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 of ammonium sulfate in the culture medium. ANOVA showed a correlation coefficient of 93 and 88% for Trichoderma CMIAT 054 and CMIAT 041 strains, respectively. Reduced regression models for the cellulase produced by these strains were obtained.'

Abstract: "Acid soils occupy approximately 30% or 3950 m ha of the world's ice free land area and occur mainly in two global belts where they have developed under udic or ustic moisture regimes. The northern belt (cold and temperate climate) is dominated by Spodosols, Alfisols, Inceptisols and Histosols and the southern tropical belt consists largely of Ultisols and Oxisols."

Abstract: 'Involving indigenous peoples in the development of mitigation measures for climate change presents procedural, conceptual and\xc2\xa0structural challenges. Here, we reflect on some of these challenges and ways of overcoming them, as suggested by collaborative approaches to policy and decision making. We specifically focus on issues of scale, knowledge and power, and how they interrelate to act as a barrier or opportunity for the involvement of indigenous groups. We argue that multi-scalar negotiations, blended knowledge and power-sharing structures are all necessary to include indigenous communities as valuable partners in climate change mitigation, and we suggest strategies and recommendations for actively accomplishing this inclusion. Examples from recent literature about the inclusion of indigenous communities in different sectors, are used to illustrate and provide evidence of the current problematic and\xc2\xa0the need for collaborative solutions. Overall, the ideas expressed here, serve as a conceptual framework to better understand and support the inclusion of indigenous communities in policy and decision making processes.'

Abstract: 'The wetlands on the Zoige Plateau have experienced serious degradation, with most of the original marsh being converted to marsh meadow or meadow. Based on the 3 wetland degradation stages, we determined the effects of wetland degradation on the structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling (nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying) microbial communities in 3 soil types (intact wetland: marsh soil; early degrading wetland: marsh meadow soil; and degraded wetland: meadow soil) using 454-pyrosequencing. The structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities differed in the 3 soil types. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in most soil samples but the most abundant soil nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying microbial bacteria differed at the class, order, family, and genus levels among the 3 soil types. At the genus level, the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacterium sequences related to Bradyrhizobium were from marsh and marsh meadow soils; whereas those related to Geobacter originated from meadow soil. The majority of ammonia-oxidizing bacterium sequences related to Nitrosospira were from marsh (except for the 40-60 cm layer), marsh meadow and meadow soils; whereas those related to Candidatus Solibacter originated from 40-60 cm layer of marsh soil. The majority of denitrifying bacterium sequences related to Candidatus Solibacter and Anaeromyxobacter were from marsh and meadow soils; whereas those related to Herbaspirillum originated from meadow soil. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species were correlated with soil type based upon Venn and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Changes in soil type, caused by different water regimes were the most important factors influencing compositional changes in the nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying microbial communities.'

Abstract: 'We tested whether the presence of a predator (non-lethal effect) could produce patterns of prey distribution and abundance attributed historically to direct mortality. Sixteen experimental ponds (1,000\xc2\xa0l cattle watering tanks) were established; eight containing seven enclosed banded sunfish, Enneacanthus obesus, and eight predator-free controls. Ponds were colonized by ovipositing squirrel treefrogs, Hyla squirella, and a total of 33,128\xc2\xa0eggs and tadpoles were recovered from the experimental ponds. Significantly more eggs and tadpoles (94.8%) were recorded from the predator-free treatments. These data support an alternative mechanism, based primarily on maternal behavior, explaining classic patterns of anuran species composition across a landscape of breeding sites.'

Abstract: 'Eucalyptus trees are widespread in subtropical parts of Turkey that have alkaline environments due to the soil structure of Taurus Mountains. In this study, the existence of Cryptococcus neoformans in eucalyptus trees in the South Aegean and Mediterranean Regions of Anatolia, Turkey, was screened between March 1998 and September 2002. Only one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (Serotype A) was isolated from 1175 eucalyptus samples including debris and flowers in culture by Guizotia abyssinica agar. The environmental niche of the isolate was Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn in the Gokova Region, in the western part of the Taurus Mountains. In this study, the existence of Cryptococcus neoformans was shown in the eucalyptus flora of Turkey despite the alkaline soil condition.'

Abstract: 'Endophytic fungi are the microorganisms which asymptomatically colonize internal tissues of plant roots and shoots. Endophytes produce a broad spectrum of odorous compounds with different physicochemical and biological properties that make them useful in both industry and agriculture. Many endophytic fungi are known to produce a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds with high densities, which include terpenes, flavonoids, alkaloids, quinines, cyclohexanes, and hydrocarbons. Many of these compounds showed anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anti-neoplastic, anti-leishmanial and anti-proliferative activities, cytotoxicity, and fuel production. In this review, the role of volatile compounds produced by fungal endophytes in fuel production and their potential application in biological control is discussed.'

Abstract: 'Brazil is one of the main centers of origin of pineapple species presenting the largest genetic variation of the Ananas genus. Embrapa Cassava and Fruits is a Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation and has an ex-situ collection of 678 accessions of the Ananas genus and some other Bromeliaceae. The use of ornamental pineapple has increased in the last years demanding new varieties, mainly for the external market, due to the originality and colors of its tiny fruits. The main aim of the present study was describing accessions from the pineapple gene bank in order to quantify their genetic variation and identify possible progenitors to be used in breeding programs of ornamental pineapples. Eighty-nine accessions of Ananas comosus var. comosus, A. comosus var. bracteatus (Lindl.) Coppens et Leal, A. comosus var. ananassoides (Baker) Coppens et Leal, A. comosus var. erectifolius (L. B. Smith) Coppens et Leal, A. comosus var. parguasensis (Camargo et L. B. Smith) Coppens et Leal and A. macrodontes Morren were evaluated with 25 morphological descriptors. According to the results, the evaluated accessions were separated into the following categories: landscape plants, cut flower, potted plants, minifruits, foliage and hedge. The genetic distance among accessions was determined using the combined qualitative and quantitative data by the Gower algorithm. The pre-selected accessions presented genetic variation and ornamental potential for different uses. The multicategory analysis formed seven clusters through a classification method based on the average Euclidean distance between all accessions using the cut-point of genetic dissimilarity (D dg\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.35). The genotypes A. comosus var. erectifolius were selected to be used as landscape plants, cut flower, minifruits and potted plants. Accessions of A. comosus var. bracteatus and A. macrodontes were selected as landscape plants and hedge. The highest variation was observed in A. comosus var. ananassoides genotypes, which presented high potential for use as cut flowers.'

Abstract: 'Anthropogenic actions are altering fluxes of nitrogen (N) in the biosphere at unprecedented rates. Efforts to study these impacts have concentrated in the Northern hemisphere, where experimental data are available. In tropical developing countries, however, experimental studies are lacking. This paper summarizes available data and assesses the impacts of human activities on N fluxes in Puerto Rico, a densely populated Caribbean island that has experienced drastic landscape transformations over the last century associated with rapid socioeconomic changes. N yield calculations conducted in several watersheds of different anthropogenic influences revealed that disturbed watersheds export more N per unit area than undisturbed forested watersheds. Export of N from urban watersheds ranged from 4.8\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in the R\xc3\xado Bayam\xc3\xb3n watershed to 32.9\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in the highly urbanized R\xc3\xado Piedras watershed and 33.3\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in the rural-agricultural R\xc3\xado Grande de A\xc3\xb1asco watershed. Along with land use, mean annual runoff explained most of the variance in fluvial N yield. Wastewater generated in the San Juan Metropolitan Area receives primary treatment before it is discharged into the Atlantic Ocean. These discharges are N-rich and export large amounts of N to the ocean at a rate of about 140\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. Data on wet deposition of inorganic N (\\(\\hbox{NH}_{4}^{+}+\\hbox{NO}_{3}^{-}\\)) suggest that rates of atmospheric N deposition are increasing in the pristine forests of Puerto Rico. Stationary and mobile sources of NO x  (NO+NO2) and N2O generated in the large urban centers may be responsible for this trend. Comprehensive measurements are required in Puerto Rico to quantitatively characterize the local N cycle. More research is required to assess rates of atmospheric N deposition, N fixation in natural and human-dominated landscapes, N-balance associated with food and feed trade, and denitrification.'

Abstract: 'In order to disseminate their actions towards sustainable development, oil companies present, on a voluntary basis, sustainability reports based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. This work analyzes how the sustainability reports from year 2015 of four oil companies and one service provider in oil and gas segment operating in Brazil adhere to the specific core indicators of the economic, environmental and social categories, proposed by the current version of GRI guidelines. One important oil company was not included in the analysis because it does not adopt GRI guidelines in the elaboration of its sustainability report. The study adopted both qualitative and quantitative approaches to sustainability reports enabling a critical analysis of companies\xe2\x80\x99 sustainability performances. The radar-type graphic method was applied to quantify the index of adherence to the indicators in each company\xe2\x80\x99s sustainability report. The purpose of the study was to identify gaps in the sustainability reports as sustainability management tools for oil companies and demonstrate that these documents are only a means for companies to report their sustainable actions and take benefits for their images. The study concluded on the lack of full adherence to GRI guidelines and points to the need to develop a system of indicators more resolvable and capable of measuring the sustainability performance of oil companies, down to the level of operating units.'

Abstract: 'Euglossini bees are among the main pollinators of plant species in tropical and subtropical forests in Central and South America. These bees are known as long-distance pollinators due to their exceptional flight performance. Here we assessed through microsatellite loci the gene variation and genetic differentiation between populations of four abundant Euglossini species populations sampled in two areas, Picinguaba (mainland) and Anchieta Island, Ubatuba, S\xc3\xa3o Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. There was no significant genetic differentiation between the island and mainland samples of Euglossa cordata (Fst\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.008, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.60), Eulaema cingulata (Fst\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.029, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.29) and Eulaema nigrita (Fst\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.062, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.38), but a significant gene differentiation between mainland and island samples of Euglossa stellfeldi (Fst\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.028, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.016) was detected. As expected, our results showed that the water body that separates the island from the mainland does not constitute a geographic barrier for these Euglossini bees. The absence of populational structuring of three out the four species studied corroborates previous reports on those bees, characterized by large populations, with high gene diversity and gene flow and very low levels of diploid males. But the Eg. stellfeldi results clearly point that dispersal ability is not similar to all euglossine bees, what requires the development of different conservationist strategies to the Euglossini species.'

Abstract: 'Forest gaps, openings in the canopy caused by death of one or more trees, have a profound effect on forest regeneration and drive the forest growth cycle. It is therefore necessary to understand the effects of forest gaps on regeneration for modern forest management. In order to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of forest gaps on regeneration of woody plants, we conducted this review of gap effects on woody plant regeneration on the basis of 527 observations from 42 individual papers, and reported the results of these data in a meta-analysis. Overall, densities of regenerated woody plants were significantly greater (359%) in forest gaps than on the closed-canopy forest floor. The regeneration density in gaps of plantation forests was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that of natural forest because the regeneration in gaps of plantation forests was improved by both gap effects and experimental measures. Similarly, in comparison to natural gaps, regeneration was better enhanced in artificial gaps. Regeneration density exhibited a significantly positive correlation with gap size, but a negative correlation with gap age because the gap size decreased with increasing gap age. Shade tolerance of woody plants affected regeneration density in gaps and understory. Average regeneration density of shade-tolerant species exhibited a significantly positive response to gaps but densities remained lower in total than those of intermediate and shade-intolerant species. Gap effects on regeneration decreased in response to increasing temperature and precipitation because of the limiting effects of lower temperature and moisture on woody plant regeneration. In summary, forest gaps enhance woody plant regeneration, and the effects of gaps varied by forest type, gap characteristics, environmental factors and plant traits. The results of this meta-analysis are useful for better understanding the effects and roles of gaps on forest regeneration and forest management.'

Abstract: 'In this paper, I first conduct a preliminary analysis of monthly rainfall data from West Kalimantan, Indonesia that indicates that (1) dry periods periodically occur in this otherwise humid environment; (2) these dry periods are often linked to El Ni\xc3\xb1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events; and (3) the intensity of these ENSO linked dry periods has been increasing over the past two or three decades. I then examine the economic costs of the 1991 dry period to residents of several small villages near Gunung Palung National Park. Costs I considered included reduced durian fruit harvest, loss of coffee gardens, delayed rice crops, increased water hauling labor, lost wages in the forest product industry, and increased health problems. The total cost was estimated to be between approximately one-quarter and one-half of annual township income. These results of this \xe2\x80\x98economic ground truthing\xe2\x80\x99 indicate that even in one of the wettest places of the world, droughts occur and can have serious welfare consequences. To the extent that the increasing intensity of these droughts may be linked to climate change, prudence dictates that policy and decision makers should use these results to plan accordingly.'

Abstract: 'Application of organic fertilizers and charcoal increase nutrient stocks in the rooting zone of crops, reduce nutrient leaching and thus improve crop production on acid and highly weathered tropical soils. In a field trial near Manaus (Brazil) 15 different amendment combinations based on equal amounts of carbon (C) applied through chicken manure (CM), compost, charcoal, and forest litter were tested during four cropping cycles with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) in five replicates. CM amendments resulted in the highest (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) cumulative crop yield (12.4\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) over four seasons. Most importantly, surface soil pH, phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were significantly enhanced by CM. A single compost application produced fourfold more grain yield (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) than plots mineral fertilized in split applications. Charcoal significantly improved plant growth and doubled grain production if fertilized with NPK in comparison to the NPK-fertilizer without charcoal (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). The higher yields caused a significantly greater nutrient export in charcoal-amended fields, but available nutrients did not decrease to the same extent as on just mineral fertilized plots. Exchangeable soil aluminum (Al) was further reduced if mineral fertilizer was applied with charcoal (from 4.7 to 0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921). The resilience of soil organic matter (SOM) in charcoal amended plots (8 and 4% soil C loss, mineral fertilized or not fertilized, respectively) indicates the refractory nature of charcoal in comparison to SOM losses over 20\xc2\xa0months in CM (27%), compost amended (27%), and control plots (25% loss).'

Abstract: 'Moisture availability has the potential to affect tropical forest productivity at scales ranging from leaf to ecosystem. We compared data for leaf photosynthetic, chemical and structural traits of canopy trees, litterfall production and seasonal availability of soil water at four sites across a precipitation gradient (1,800\xe2\x80\x933,500 mm year\xe2\x88\x921) in lowland Panamanian forest to determine how productivity at leaf and ecosystem scales may be related. We found stronger seasonality in soil water potential at drier sites. Values were close to zero at all sites during the wet season and varied between a minimum of \xe2\x88\x922.5 MPa and \xe2\x88\x920.3 MPa at the driest and wettest sites, respectively, during the dry season. Leaf photosynthesis and nitrogen concentration decreased with increasing precipitation, whereas leaf thickness increased with increasing precipitation. Leaf toughness and fiber/N ratios increased with increasing precipitation indicating reduced nutritional content and palatability with precipitation. Seasonality of litter production and quality decreased with increasing precipitation, but the amount of litterfall produced was not substantially different among sites. It appears that in Neotropical forest, moisture availability is associated with leaf photosynthetic and defensive traits that influence litterfall timing and quality. Therefore, variation in leaf physiological traits has the potential to influence decomposition and nutrient cycling through effects on litter quality.'

Abstract: 'Ecosystem-based planning and management have stimulated the need to gather sociocultural values and human uses of land in formats accessible to diverse planners and researchers. Human Ecology Mapping (HEM) approaches offer promising spatial data gathering and analytical tools, while also addressing important questions about human-landscape connections. This article reviews and compares the characteristics of three HEM approaches that are increasingly used in natural resource management contexts, each focused on a particular aspect of human-environmental interactions. These aspects include tenure and resource use (TRU), local ecological knowledge (LEK), and sense of place (SOP). We discuss their origins, provide examples of their use, and identify challenges to their application. Our review serves as a guide for environmental managers, planners, and communities interested in gathering spatial data on aspects of human ecology important in ecosystem-based management and planning, and for scientists designing socioecological research.'

Abstract: 'Benthic community metabolism was studied on four stream systems located in different biomes in the United States: the eastern deciduous forest (Pennsylvania, PA, and Michigan, MI), the high desert (Idaho, ID), and the coniferous forest (Oregon, OR). Studies were designed to test the hypothesis advanced within the River Continuum Concept that a transition in community metabolism will occur from a predominance of heterotrophy in headwaters to a predominance of autotrophy in mid-sized reaches, with a return to heterotrophy further downstream. Both gross primary productivity (GPP) and community respiration (CR24) increased with downstream direction on all systems. Net daily metabolism (NDM, or GPP \xe2\x88\x92 CR24) shifted from heterotrophy (\xe2\x88\x92NDM, GPP < CR24) to autotrophy (+NDM, GPP > CR24) with downstream direction at all sites, supporting the hypothesis. Annual metabolism in the most upstream reach of all sites was dominated by respiration; however, the farthest downstream reach was not necessarily the most autotrophic. Site-specific factors affected manifestation of the trend. Photosynthesis predominated annual metabolism in reaches (designated 1\xe2\x80\x934 in order of increasing size) 2\xe2\x80\x934 in ID, 3 and 4 in OR, and 4 in MI. In PA annual photosynthesis was slightly greater than respiration only at Station 3. Photosynthesis was predominant most consistently in ID and respiration most often in PA. About half the reaches that were heterotrophic annually were autotrophic at one or more seasons. Annual means of benthic GPP, CR24 and NDM ranged from 0.16 to 3.37, 0.36 to 2.88 and \xe2\x88\x920.73 to 0.50 g O2 \xc2\xb7 m2 \xc2\xb7 d1, respectively. Metabolic rates were usually high in PA and MI (and sometimes ID) and almost always lowest in OR. Parameters accounting for most variance in multiple linear regression analyses of the combined metabolism data from all sites were indicators of stream size, photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and chlorophyll a concentration.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Cerrado, a global biodiversity hotspot, is being converted to agricultural production. Amphibians in particular are susceptible to agricultural practices that threaten both their wetland and upland habitats. Although local site variables are important for determining species occurrence, site occupancy is also mediated by the broader landscape and management context in which the site occurs.'

Abstract: 'Use of Medicinal Plants Among Thai Ethnic Groups: A Comparison. Thailand has a large rural population that uses traditional medicinal plants extensively. The country is also the home of many groups of ethnic minorities. But even if much ethnobotanical research has been done in many parts of the country, most studies focused on a single village or a few; only a few of the studies were concerned with comparing the ethnobotanical information among groups or regions of the country. This makes it relevant to compare ethnobotanical knowledge among different ethnic groups in Thailand, including both the rural Thai majority and the various minorities. For our comparison, we collected data about the use of medicinal plants from 64 books, journal articles, scientific reports, and theses published from 1990 to 2014. The data covered 16,789 use reports from 2187 plant species used in 121 villages inhabited by 26 ethnic groups, including rural Thais living in all regions of Thailand. The data were compared using the Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) and clustering analysis. We found that villages inhabited by the same ethnic group often used different plant species while villages in same region had higher similarity of used species for treatments in the\xc2\xa0same use category, irrespective of which ethnic group that inhabited them. Clustering diagrams showed that similarity in the use of plants was not larger for villages inhabited by the same ethnic groups or from the same regions. So, it appeared that each village had, at least in part, developed its own ethnomedicinal knowledge.'

Abstract: 'Effective monitoring of ecosystems is crucial for assessing and possibly anticipating shifts, quantifying ecosystem services, and optimal decision making based on shifts and services. The selection of monitoring sites is typically suboptimal following local stakeholder or research interests that do not allow to capture ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a whole. The design of optimal monitoring network is crucial for the accurate determination of biodiversity patterns of ecosystems. A novel model for the design of optimal monitoring networks for biodiversity based on the concept of the value of information (VoI) is proposed. The VoI is assigned to species richness that is the economically and ecologically valuable metric. As a case study the trinational frontier ecosystem among Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia is considered for the model. A multiresolution texture-based model estimates species richness and turnover on satellite imagery calibrated on different sets of information coming from forest plot data organized in network topologies. The optimal monitoring network is the network that minimizes the integrated VoI defined as the variation of the VoI in the 28 years considered. This is equivalent to minimize the sum of the species turnover of the ecosystem. The small world network is identified as the optimal and most resilient monitoring network whose nodes are the hotspots of species richness. The hotspots are identified as the sites whose VoI is the highest for the whole period considered. Hence, the hotspots are the most valuable communities for inferring biodiversity patterns and the most ecologically/economically valuable according to the richness\xe2\x80\x94resilience hypothesis. Most hotspots are honored by the small world network that can be thought as the \xe2\x80\x9dbackbone\xe2\x80\x9d ecological network of the ecosystem. The small world monitoring network has an accuracy ~50\xc2\xa0% higher than other network topologies in predicting biodiversity patterns. This network has the highest VoI at any time step and scale considered; thus, it guarantees to track changes of ecosystems in space and time. The network that results from the optimal trade-off between data value with their uncertainty and relevance, has deep implications for understanding ecosystem function and for management decisions. The model allows to include preferences for ecosystem communities by using differential weights on the VoI of these communities, and economic constraints that limit the extension of the network. Because of the optimal integration of environmental, social, and economical factors the model allows a sustainable monitoring and planning of biodiversity for the future.'

Abstract: 'The effect of water activity on the quality parameters of cocona chips obtained by a combined osmotic dehydration and hot air-drying method has been studied. Applying the combined treatment resulted in a product with 0.055\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.005\xc2\xa0g water/g product in 4.3\xc2\xa0h of drying. Although this treatment caused a significant decrease (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) in the bioactive compounds analyzed, the antioxidant activity of the samples remained stable compared to fresh fruit. The applied treatment permitted the development of a sweet, crispy snack with acceptable optical and mechanical properties. To evaluate the stability of the cocona chips during storage, the water sorption behaviour (20\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) and the relationship between the water content, water activity and the glass transition were also studied. Results showed that in order to ensure the functional quality preservation of cocona chips during long-term storage and avoid the crispness loss, the glassy state of the amorphous matrix must be guaranteed.'

Abstract: 'Field experiments indicate that the foliar concentration of condensed tannin affects the selection of leaf material ofInga oerstediana Benth., a tropical legume tree, by leaf cutter ants. In one study an increase in tannin concentration was correlated with a decrease in the acceptability of leaves to leaf-cutter ants, except at low tannin concentrations. Protein concentration was not correlated with acceptability nor was the ratio of protein to tannin. Results from a second study suggest that when the concentration of tannin was low the ants appear to select leaves on the basis of nutrient availability. Laboratory assays with the ants indicated that quebracho tannin, a commercially available condensed tannin, inhibits foraging ants. Again, at lower concentrations, quebracho tannin appeared to have little affect on the ants. The fungus the ants cultivate is a wood-rotting Basidiomycete that produces enzymes, such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO), that are capable of inactivating tannins. The activity of these PPOs may explain why leaf-cutter ants are undeterred by low concentrations of condensed tannins. I hypothesized that PPO activity would be absent from fungal cultures without tannin and that only high concentrations of tannin would inhibit the fungus. Cultures with and without tannin showed similar PPO activity. Thus PPO activity is constitutive. In fact, as fungal biomass increased, so did PPO activity. As hypothesized, only high concentrations of quebracho tannin inhibited PPO activity and fungal growth. However, it is not clear whether the ants can discriminate between concentrations that do and do not inhibit the fungus.'

Abstract: 'Nest site selection in arboreal, domatia-dwelling ants, particularly those coexisting on a single host plant, is little understood. To examine this phenomenon we studied the African savannah tree Vachellia erioloba, which hosts ants in swollen-thorn domatia. We found four ant species from different genera (Cataulacus intrudens, Tapinoma subtile, Tetraponera ambigua and an unidentified Crematogaster species). In contrast to other African ant plants, many V. erioloba trees (41\xc2\xa0% in our survey) were simultaneously co-occupied by more than one ant species. Our study provides quantitative field data describing: (1) aspects of tree and domatia morphology relevant to supporting a community of mutualist ants, (2) how ant species occupancy varies with domatia morphology and (3) how ant colony size varies with domatia size and species. We found that Crematogaster sp. occupy the largest thorns, followed by C. intrudens, with T. subtile in the smallest thorns. Thorn age, as well as nest entrance hole size correlated closely with ant species occupant. These differing occupancy patterns may help to explain the unusual coexistence of three ant species on individual myrmecophytic trees. In all three common ant species, colony size, as measured by total number of ants, increased with domatia size. Additionally, domatia volume and species identity interact to predict ant numbers, suggesting differing responses between species to increased availability of nesting space. The proportion of total ants in nests that were immatures varied with thorn volume and species, highlighting the importance of domatia morphology in influencing colony structure.'

Abstract: 'We conducted a 5-month survey on primates, with special attention to Goeldi\xe2\x80\x99s monkey (Callimico goeldii),in the rainforest of northwestern Bolivia. Goeldi\xe2\x80\x99s monkey is one of the least documented of all South American primates, and very little is known about its distribution. We report observations on distribution, abundance, and habitat of Callimico goeldiiand other primates, incidental sightings of other mammals, and preliminary behavioral observations on Callimicoand on two associated callitrichid monkey species: Saguinus fuscicollisand S. labiatus.We found a locality that appears to be particularly suitable for detailed field observations on Callimico on the north bank of the lower R\xc3\xado Tahuamanu.'

Abstract: 'Firewood is the basic fuel source in rural Bolivia. A study was conducted in an Andean village of subsistence farmers to investigate human impact on wild firewood species. A total of 114 different fuel species was inventoried during fieldtrips and transect sampling. Specific data on abundance and growth height of wild firewood species were collected in thirty-six transects of 50 \xc3\x972\xc2\xa0m2. Information on fuel uses of plants was obtained from 13 local Quechua key participants. To appraise the impact of fuel harvest, the extraction impact value (EIV) index was developed. This index takes into account local participants\xe2\x80\x99 appreciation of (1) decreasing plant abundance; (2) regeneration capacity of plants; (3) impact of root harvesting; and (4) quality of firewood. Results suggest that several (sub-)woody plant species are negatively affected by firewood harvesting. We found that anthropogenic pressure, expressed as EIV, covaried with density of firewood species, which could entail higher human pressure on more abundant and/or more accessible species. The apparent negative impact of anthropogenic pressure on populations of wild fuel species is corroborated by our finding that, in addition to altitude, several anthropogenic variables (i.e. site accessibility, cultivation of exotics and burning practices) explain part of the variation in height of firewood species in the surroundings of Apillapampa.'

Abstract: 'Interest in climate engineering research has grown rapidly owing to the slow progress of international climate negotiations. As some scientists are proposing to expand research and conduct field tests, there is an emerging debate about whether and how it should proceed. It is widely accepted both by the supporters and critics that public engagement from the early stage of research is necessary. Nonetheless, most, if not all, of existing research projects of climate engineering were designed predominantly by experts. To produce socially relevant knowledge, and hence, pursue transdisciplinary research that integrates interdisciplinary research and public engagement, it is desirable for scientists to decide together with the public on what kind of research should be done. In this paper, we both as Japanese scientists and stakeholders collaboratively identify 40 socially relevant research questions on climate engineering with a particular emphasis on stratospheric aerosol injection, using a method designed to encourage science\xe2\x80\x93policy collaboration. While we acknowledge some methodological problems and the difficulty in obtaining active participation from stakeholders, the list of identified questions covers broad interdisciplinary perspectives and diverse interests, and may provide an important foundation for future transdisciplinary research on climate engineering. Given the dynamic nature of climate change and policy responses, research agendas should be periodically and iteratively reviewed and updated through transdisciplinary processes.'

Abstract: 'The systematic assessment of large population-based surveys addressing the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection may provide robust evidence for understanding the trends in the exposure to this major risk factor across settings with distinct patterns of gastric cancer variation. Our aim was to describe the prevalence of H. pylori infection in different countries and periods, through systematic review of the literature. We searched PubMed from inception up to September 2013 to identify original studies reporting on the prevalence of H. pylori, and only those evaluating samples with national coverage were included. We identified 37 eligible studies including data for 22 countries. The prevalences were higher in Central/South America and Asia, and at least two-fold higher in countries with high gastric cancer incidence. In most countries presenting data for different time periods, the prevalences were usually lower in the most recent surveys. However, there was little variation in settings where prevalences were already low. Among countries with high prevalence of H. pylori infection there is an ample scope for reducing its burden in the next decades, whereas further declines in settings with already low prevalences will require more intensive efforts.'

Abstract: 'In the last two decades, public administrators have increasingly faced groups of people with opposing views about the risks of exposure to environmental contaminants. Because of a series of intriguing studies on risk perception, the situation is frequently seen, by scholars and administrators alike, as a conflict between experts and citizens, and risk communication guidelines are based on this interpretation. But the citizen-expert dichotomy appears fallacious when it is examined in light of the ways citizens actually participate in environmental policy making. The dichotomy overlooks the fact that citizens express their perception of risk largely through organized citizen groups, and that these groups employ and have access to many experts. This essay uses a mainstream environmental group and a number of grassroots environmental groups to illustrate the point. It concludes that the more important conflict is between experts who find environmental pollution safe and those who find it hazardous.'

Abstract: 'Limiting climate change to 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C with a high probability requires reducing cumulative emissions to about 1600 GtCO2 over the 2000\xe2\x80\x932100 period. This requires unprecedented rates of decarbonization even in the short-run. The availability of the option of net negative emissions, such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or reforestation/afforestation, allows to delay some of these emission reductions. In the paper, we assess the demand and potential for negative emissions in particular from BECCS. Both stylized calculations and model runs show that without the possibility of negative emissions, pathways meeting the 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C target with high probability need almost immediate emission reductions or simply become infeasible. The potential for negative emissions is uncertain. We show that negative emissions from BECCS are probably limited to around 0 to 10 GtCO2/year in 2050 and 0 to 20 GtCO2/year in 2100. Estimates on the potential of afforestation options are in the order of 0\xe2\x80\x934 GtCO2/year. Given the importance and the uncertainty concerning BECCS, we stress the importance of near-term assessments of its availability as today\xe2\x80\x99s decisions has important consequences for climate change mitigation in the long run.'

Abstract: 'The natural enemy hypothesis predicts a positive correlation between plant species diversity and natural enemy control. This study aimed to evaluate the role of traditional cacao agroforests, known as \xe2\x80\x9ccabrucas,\xe2\x80\x9d on the conservation of the predatory beetle community compared to that of monodominant rubber agroforests. Predatory beetles were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: cabrucas and rubber agroforests and native Atlantic forests. In each habitat, 18 10\xc2\xa0m2 plots were established, in which canopy cover was measured and beetles were sampled with a modified Malaise/window trap. Land use intensification did not affect the composition of predatory beetles, with the presence of widely distributed species that are also capable of colonizing simpler environments such as the rubber agroforest. Canopy cover had a positive effect on generalist predator diversity and we observed a reduction in the abundance and species richness of generalist predators with increasing habitat homogenization. Despite the simplified structure of the habitat, the remaining tree diversity and canopy cover in cabrucas supported a community of generalist predators similar to the one found in the native forest. Species diversity of bark beetle predators was higher in cabrucas, which may be due to the high diversity of bark beetles and the favorable abiotic conditions, whereas the low abundance of prey in the native forest and severe abiotic conditions in the rubber agroforest probably determined the lower diversity of generalist predators in these habitats. Cabrucas play an important role in the conservation, supporting a community of predatory beetles more similar to the one found in native forest and that is more effective at controlling populations of herbivores than in homogeneous rubber agroforests.'

Abstract: ' Casearia (Salicaceae sensu lato) species have been used as folk medicines in South American and Asian countries since ancient times. Previous phytochemical screenings demonstrated that the Casearia plants mainly contain clerodane diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids and other constituents from different chemical classes. The pharmacological studies confirmed that the crude extracts or individual compounds from the genus showed cytotoxic, hypoglycemic, antiulcer, and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as anti-snake venom property. In this review we presented a summary of the secondary metabolites isolated from Casearia species based on the published literatures through May 2013. In addition to the traditional medicinal use of Casearia plants and their taxonomic characteristics, we focused on the known biological activities of the plants and discussed them in detail here.'

Abstract: 'The seasonal cambial activity of five tropical tree species was investigated at Khao Yai National Park. The species studied were Tetrameles nudiflora, Magnolia baillonii, Canarium euphyllum Kur, Toona ciliata, and Spondias axillaris. Cambial activity was quantified by counting layers of undifferentiated cells in the cambium zone from wood anatomical micro sections prepared from wood samples collected in monthly intervals from July 2010 to June 2011. The relationship between cambial activity and climatic factors was investigated by using Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s correlation. The growth dynamics of five studied species differed considerably. The cambium of Tetrameles nudiflora and Magnolia baillonii was most active when rainfall reached its maximum amount in June (mid rainy season), whereas the cambium of Canarium euphyllum, Toona ciliata, and Spondias axillaris was most active in March during the transition from the dry to the wet season.'

Abstract: 'Some scientists have suggested that the Huancabamba Depression in northern Peru\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the partial interruption of the Andean chain by the Rio Chamaya drainage system\xe2\x80\x94represents a major biogeographical barrier to montane taxa. Others have suggested that the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone in the Andes of northern Peru and the extreme south of Ecuador is an area of particular biological diversity and possibly a phytogeographical zone in its own right.'

Abstract: 'Land use changes from natural ecosystems into managed ecosystems may have deleterious effects on soil structure and quality. This study characterise the soils under, and assesses the effects of different land use systems on selected soil physicochemical properties in the North West region of Cameroon. Six land use systems including: natural forest, natural savanna, grazing land, afforested land, farmland and Eucalyptus plantation were identified. Ninety soil samples were collected from each at the 0\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0cm depth. Fifteen soil physicochemical properties were measured.'

Abstract: '\nThe concept of spatial resilience has brought a new focus on the influence of multi-scale processes on the dynamics of ecosystems. Initial ideas about spatial resilience focused on coral reefs and emphasized escalating anthropogenic disturbances across the broader seascape. This perspective resonated with a new awareness of global drivers of change, such as growth in international trade and shifts in climate, and the need to respond by scaling up governance and management. We review recent trends and emerging ideas in spatial resilience, using coral reefs and dependent communities as exemplars of multi-scale social\xe2\x80\x93ecological systems. Despite recent advances, management and governance of ecosystems remain spatially fragmented and constrained to small scales. Temporally, many interventions still miss or ignore warning signals and struggle to cope with history, politics, long-term cumulative pressures, feedbacks, and sudden surprises. Significant recent progress has been made in understanding the relevance of spatial and temporal scale, heterogeneity, networks, the importance of place, and multi-scale governance. Emerging themes include better integration of ecology and conservation with social and economic science, and incorporating temporal dynamics in spatial analyses. A better understanding of the multi-scale spatial and temporal processes that drive the resilience of linked social-ecosystems will help address the widespread mismatch between the scales of ongoing ecological change and effective long-term governance of land- and seascapes.'

Abstract: 'In disturbed sites, some groups of seeds might be excluded from the seed rain due to their dispersal modes or seed size, and some groups might be successful as a result of disturbance effects. In the present study, we examined the seed rain in natural treefall gaps and in an area of regenerating forest following an accidental burning, which occurred 4\xc2\xa0years before this study. Both of these disturbed areas were compared with nearby forest understorey. The number of seeds, number of species, and proportion of wind-dispersed seeds were compared between these disturbed and undisturbed areas. The treefall gaps have received lower numbers of seeds and species than the nearby understorey, but the number of wind-dispersed seeds did not differ between these areas. The lowest seed number observed in treefall gaps can be attributed to a lower number of animal-dispersed seeds, suggesting that animals may be avoiding treefall gap areas. A higher number of seeds and a lower number of species were observed in the burned area when compared to the adjacent understorey. The high number of small-sized seeds and of wind-dispersed seeds in the burned area was almost surely a consequence of the local production of the pioneer plants established after the burning. In this study, substantial differences were observed in the characteristics of the seed rain at disturbed sites, when compared with undisturbed understorey. However, these two distinct types of disturbance showed quite differing patterns, as treefall gaps received lower number of seeds while the burned area received a higher number of seeds, with a greater proportion of wind-dispersed seeds. The exception was for species richness, which was quite low at both these disturbed sites.'

Abstract: 'Harvesting, consumption and trade of forest meat are key causes of biodiversity loss. Successful mitigation programs are proving difficult to design, in part because anthropogenic pressures are treated as internationally uniform. Despite illegal hunting being a key conservation issue in the Pacific Islands, there is a paucity of research. Here, we examine the dynamics of hunting of birds and determine how these contribute to biodiversity loss on the islands of Samoa. We focus on the interactive effects of hunting on two key seed dispersing bird species: the Pacific pigeon (Ducula pacifica) and the critically endangered Manumea or tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigiristris). We interviewed hunters, vendors and consumers and analyzed household consumption. Results suggest that over 22,000 pigeons were consumed per year and this is by primarily the richest people across the country. Indeed, the wealthiest 10% of households consumed 43% of all wild pigeon meat, and the wealthiest 40% of households consumed 80% of all pigeons. The Manumea was shot by 33% (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa030) of the surveyed hunters while pursuing the Pacific pigeon. Results raise serious conservation concerns, as pigeon hunting is likely to be a key factor contributing to the decline of the Manumea and critical forest seed dispersers in general. Our results show that wild meat consumption can lead to non-targeted pressure on bycatch species. Wild meat harvesting and consumption is a key issue leading to species declines and extinctions in the tropics. It is critical that this issue receives the appropriate attention and is addressed in the Pacific if species and forests are to be maintained.'

Abstract: 'Seasonal drought may have a high impact on the karst ecosystem. The transpiration from Cyclobalanopsis glauca (syn. Quercus glauca) stand on a rocky hilly slope in South China was measured during the dry period of 2006 by using the Granier\xe2\x80\x99s sap-flow method. During the experimental period, maximum sap flux density (J s) ranged from 20 to 40\xc2\xa0g H2O\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921 according to diameter of breast height (DBH) of individual trees. On sunny days, daily transpiration varied between 3.4 and 1.8\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x88\x921. Transpiration of C. glauca was closely correlated to the radiation, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Soil moisture was a very important factor influencing transpiration. The very low soil water content might result in low stand transpiration even when VPD is high, but high soil water content might also result in low transpiration if it was low VPD. However, VPD rather than soil moisture, affected largely the stand transpiration under high soil water content. The amount of transpiration was much more than that of the total soil moisture loss during the continuous sunny days, indicating that the dry shallow soils were probably not the only source for root-uptake water. C. glauca grows deep roots through the rock fissures of epikarst, indicating that epikarst might be another main source for sustaining transpiration in response to dry demand in autumn. Therefore, a large amount of deep roots of karst species would be a very important hydraulic connecting from the epikarst to above ground by transpiration, which would promote the biogeochemical process in a karst system.'

Abstract: 'Members of Oncidiinae are widely known for their interactions with oil-collecting bees that explore lipophilic secretions on flowers. They may also be pollinated through food deception and the offering of nectar. Although data on breeding systems are available for many Oncidiinae orchids, little is known about the reproductive strategies in Rodriguezia, a neotropical genus of ca. 55 species. In this paper, we explore the reproductive biology of two species of Rodriguezia with distinctive morphologies: R. decora and R. lanceolata. Floral features, spectral reflectance, pollinators and pollination mechanisms, and breeding systems were studied. Both species are scentless and produce nectar as a reward. Floral nectar is secreted by a gland at the base of the labellum and stored into the sepaline spur. Rodriguezia decora reflects mainly in the blue and red regions of the light spectrum, while R. lanceolata reflects in the red region. Rodriguezia decora is exclusively visited and pollinated by butterflies, while Trochilidae hummingbirds are the pollinators of R. lanceolata. Pollinaria attach to the upper third of the proboscis of butterflies (R. decora), and to the bill of hummingbirds (R. lanceolata), during the collection of nectar from the spur. Both Rodriguezia species are self-sterile. Flower features and floral reflectance support the occurrence of psychophily in R. decora and ornithophily in R. lanceolata.'

Abstract: 'Carrizo Plain National Monument (San Joaquin Desert, California, USA) is home to many threatened and endangered species including the blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila). Vegetation is dominated by annual grasses, and shrubs such as Mormon tea (Ephedra californica), which is of relevance to our target species, the federally listed blunt-nosed leopard lizard, and likely also provides key ecosystem services. We used relatively nonintrusive camera traps, or trail cameras, to capture interactions between animals and these shrubs using a paired shrub-open deployment. Cameras were placed within the shrub understory and in open microhabitats at ground level to estimate animal activity and determine species presence.'

Abstract: ' Wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the interesting issues in the information technology domain. It is used in various fields such as medicine, agriculture, meteorology, etc. that eases lots of difficult tasks to do but have some challenges too. Deployment is the greatest challenge in WSN that affects other features like coverage, connectivity, energy efficient and lifetime. Despite the importance of the deployment problem in WSN, to the best of our knowledge, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any systematic literature review to give us systematical analyses the state-of-the mechanisms in this field. Therefore, this study reviewed the deployment mechanisms which have been used in WSN systematically. The deployment mechanisms can be classified into two main categories: deterministic and nondeterministic. Also, this study represents a comparison of the important techniques of the selected articles in each category to offer a guideline for further studies and new challenges. We also have noted some open issues for future research.'

Abstract: 'Many ecological theories are based on the concept of patches. Patches are a useful starting point for conservation efforts, but a focus on patches alone will not always achieve desired conservation outcomes. Conservation strategies in the grazing landscapes of southeastern Australia suggest that large patches of trees are widely regarded as \xe2\x80\x98habitat\xe2\x80\x99 while other forms of habitat are largely ignored. We provide data on birds and reptiles from the Nanangroe grazing landscape that illustrate the potential habitat value of areas located between large patches of trees \xe2\x80\x93 that is, the matrix. Despite evidence on its potential value, present conservation strategies rarely consider the matrix. Possible reasons for this bias relate to the economics of farming and the history of land use, the current environmental law framework, and also the reluctance of ecologists to study the matrix. More scientific evidence on the role of the matrix will be crucial if conservation strategies are to consider not only patches, but entire landscapes. However, for science to be relevant to land management, there is a need for new research approaches. First, an increased consideration of environmental policy and law will increase the likelihood of scientific findings being adopted by policy makers. Second, at an applied level, more practical on-ground research into farming practices and clearer communication are necessary to achieve more sustainable matrix management in Australian grazing landscapes.'

Abstract: 'The results of studying biological aerosols (pollen spectra) in precipitation registered in the south of Western Siberia in the winter of 2014/15 are presented. Pollen grains of birch (Betula sp.), willow (Salix sp.), pine (Pinus sp.), and poplar (Populus sp.) were identified in the three of 28 analyzed precipitation samples. The comprehensive analysis of synoptic conditions during precipitation, back trajectories of air masses calculated with the HYSPLIT model as well as the analysis of the Northern Hemisphere snow cover dynamics and the area of distribution of the identified taxa were carried out. The results allowed determining the Euro-Scandinavian region as the main source of pollen grains inflow with precipitation to the south of Western Siberia in March 2015.'

Abstract: ' Eucalypt forest attributes describing structure are required for a range of management and inventory programs. The characterization of vegetation structure can be a laborious task and so managers and researchers are seeking alternatives through the use of remote sensing. Forest structure and the distribution of biomass through the forest canopy has a significant effect on radar backscatter and, in many cases, is the overwhelming variable in determining the type and quantity of radar backscatter observed in forest environments. In southern Tasmania a combination of field-based inventory plots and forest type maps were accessed to condense large variations in forest structure into five archetypical structural forest types. We then utilized a forest backscatter model to simulate the backscatter response of these five forest structural types for a range of radar wavelengths and polarizations. Good correlative relationships were obtained between backscatter and forest structure. There was a particularly good relationship between synthetic aperture radar to variations in allocation of biomass to stems, branches, and leaves. These individual and grouped attributes in eucalypt forests appear to influence radar backscatter enough to develop predictive relationships between backscatter and forest structure. Strong correlations were observed with radar P- and C-band wavelengths with foliage and bole biomass and between the ratio of L to C with foliage and branch allocations. Within Australian wet sclerophyll forests, where the biomass is typically very high, the true capacity and applicability of radar imagery may not be in direct biomass estimation but rather in the capacity of radar data to stratify forest stands based on structural variation.'

Abstract: 'Livestock production is a recognized source of environmental impact, and this sector indirectly involves approximately 5 million people in Brazil. Livestock production includes nearly 1.5 million milk producers that use several different production systems. We chose the southern region of Brazil to evaluate the carbon footprint (CF) per 1\xc2\xa0kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM) at the farm gate for different dairy production systems with the use of a good level of technology.'

Abstract: 'We have studied the incisor enamel microstructure ofChaetomys subspinosus and other possibly closely related caviomorph rodents.Chaetomys subspinosus lacks the important synapomorphy of the Octodontoidea, reactangular plate-like interprismatic matrix (IPM) in the portio interna (PI) of the incisor Schmelzmuster. Therefore its transfer from the Erethizontidae to the Echimyidae, as proposed by Patterson and Wood (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. 149, 371\xe2\x80\x93543, 1982) based on retention of dP4, is contested. The parallel to acute angular IPM in the PI ofChaetomys and the Erethizontidae is a symplesiomorphy and does not indicate close relationship. Contrary to previous claims, a posterior carotid foramen is also retained inChaetomys. Chaetomys is characterized by an unusual thin enamel which is considered primitive after outgroup comparison. Therefore, it is proposed to leaveChaetomys in the monospecific erethizontid subfamily Chaetomyinae, until additional information on the species is available.'

Abstract: 'The Cerrado biome in the Sete Cidades National Park, an Ecological Reserve in Northeastern Brazil, has conserved its native biodiversity and presents a variety of plants found in other savannas in Brazil. Despite this finding the soil microbial diversity and community structure are poorly understood. Therefore, we described soil bacterial diversity and distribution along a savanna vegetation gradient taking into account the prevailing environmental factors. The bacterial composition was retrieved by sequencing a fragment of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned to 37 different phyla, 96 classes, and 83 genera. At the phylum level, a core comprised by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes, was detected in all areas of Cerrado. \xe2\x80\x98Cerrado stricto sensu\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Cerradao\xe2\x80\x99 share more similarities between edaphic properties and vegetation and also present more similar bacterial communities, while \xe2\x80\x98Floresta decidual\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Campo graminoide\xe2\x80\x99 show the largest environmental differences and also more distinct bacterial communities. Proteobacteria (26%), Acidobacteria (21%) and Actinobacteria (21%) were the most abundant phyla within the four areas. All the samples present similar bacteria richness (alpha diversity) and the observed differences among them (beta diversity) were more related to the abundance of specific taxon OTUs compared to their presence or absence. Total organic C, N and P are the main abiotic factors structuring the bacterial communities. In summary, our findings show the bacterial community structure was clearly different across the Cerrado gradient, but that these environments share a bacterial phylum-core comprising Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes with other Brazilian savannas.'

Abstract: 'A critical need exists throughout the humid tropics for interdisciplinary research that collects, evaluates, and makes available to decision makers the information contained in locally developed land-use systems. One such system is the forest garden developed by residents of several villages in the Gunung Palung region of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The forest gardens are part of a broader land-use spectrum that contains farms, home gardens, forest gardens, and forest extraction areas in a gradient leading away from the villages to the protected forests in the park. Over the past several years, while conducting a multidisciplinary study of this system, I have come to the conclusion that the forest gardens are a variant of the traditional home garden that have been developed by the local communities in response to the development of new economic markets. In this paper, I provide a baseline description of the study region, methods used, and the different types of forest gardens in the study site. I then conclude with discussions of related land-use systems throughout the world, how forest gardens differ from home gardens, how forest gardens might be formally defined, and future work that will be necessary for a better understanding of these forest garden systems.'

Abstract: 'All too often, a small, private forest property fails to meet its potential for the owner or for the community. This is particularly true of depopulating rural areas in industrialized countries where community demographics are changing most. Some attention has recently been given to rural tourism as an option to assist Asian farmers in these circumstances, but what of its potential to assist small-scale forestry producers? This paper examines a population of small forest property owners in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The paper assesses the receptiveness of this community of forest owners to the idea of tourism in their forests. Using original survey data, the paper illustrates that private forest owners\xe2\x80\x99 openness to tourism is strongly related to their interpretation of \xe2\x80\x98forest\xe2\x80\x99 in metaphorical terms. The paper concludes by suggesting the best way to pursue the development of \xe2\x80\x98forest tourism\xe2\x80\x99 in this community is to rely on the forest owners cooperative to re-package the concept as a \xe2\x80\x98secondary forest use\xe2\x80\x99, more closely reflecting forest owners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretations of the forest resource.'

Abstract: 'For many decades, simplification of traditionally shaded coffee-production systems has been an idealised model for increasing yields. In Mexico, coffee producers have been interested in replacing diverse natural shade with Inga species monocultures due to this practice having the supposed advantages of producing higher coffee yields than diverse shade. However, the effect of different shade systems on yields is little known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of two types of shaded-coffee systems on coffee yields and soil nutrient content; the first shade system is mainly dominated by Inga latibracteata Harms and the other composed of species-rich natural vegetation. The investigation took place in producer plots in the Francisco I. Madero Community, Municipality of Jitotol, Chiapas, Mexico. Collected data included species richness, shade-tree density, number of strata, tree diameter, tree height, shade-cover percentage, direct and diffused light, coffee yields, soil-nutrient concentrations (N, P, K, Ca and Mg), soil-organic matter and pH. Evaluated shade type did not have an effect on grain yield or soil nutrients. The perceived advantage of the Inga shade system is reduced weed emergence, saving farmers one annual weed-clearing. There was no significant correlation between total N and organic matter. The presence of fewer products and services in comparison to the multiple shade system was thought to be an additional disadvantage to the Inga dominated system. Organic matter in the multiple shade system correlated positively with total N. Due to its complex structure and diversity, the multiple shade system could be certified as shade or bird-friendly coffee.'

Abstract: 'An ethnobotanical survey was carried out to collect information on the use of medicinal plants by the Lisu people who live in the mountainous areas of the Nujiang Canyon (Salween River Valley) in Nujiang Prefecture, northwestern Yunnan Province, China. A total of 52 medicinal plants, belonging to 32 families, were reported as being used locally for the treatment of human ailments. The scientific and Lisu names, parts used, and preparation of the plants are presented. Most of these species are wild (80%), while others are domesticated (8%) or semi-cultivated (12%). Among the 52 species, 11 species (21.2%) were reported as rare and 16 were widely commercialized in the region. Over-exploitation and deforestation are the main causes for the depletion of medicinal plants in this area. The Lisu people still mostly depend on medicinal plants for their health care. The loss and endangered status of these plants will, to a certain extent, impede their existing health care system; conservation and sustainable harvest of medicinal plants in the area are urgently needed.'

Abstract: 'Woody legumes can play an important role in forest restoration on degraded land but the knowledge of woody legumes has lagged behind their uses. This study is a pioneer investigation to explore the ability of native woody legumes to form root nodules and fix nitrogen in Hong Kong. Nine sites of different habitat types were surveyed during both wet and dry seasons for two years. Young plants of woody legumes along studied transects were excavated. The patterns of nodulation and nodule morphology were recorded and the nitrogen fixing ability was tested by acetylene-reduction-assay. Twenty-eight species in 16 genera were examined, of which 20 species were nodulating and eight non-nodulating, including all six species in the Caesalpinioideae. Five species were new records to the world\xe2\x80\x99s nodulation inventory. Bowringia callicarpa was a new species and genus examined, which was non-nodulating. The overall nodulation pattern was consistent with previous studies. Nodulation was more profuse in some shrub species while inconsistent in most tree species. Species with higher proportion of nodulated individual plants also tended to have more nodules in each plant. Spherical nodules were common in shrub and woody climber species whilst tree species usually had woody indeterminate nodules. Seasonal difference in the amount of senescent nodules was noted in most species. All the nodules tested by acetylene-reduction-assay were effectively nitrogen-fixing, with nitrogenase activity ranging from 4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol C2H4 g\xe2\x88\x921 h\xe2\x88\x921 to 20\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol C2H4 g\xe2\x88\x921 h\xe2\x88\x921, which was comparable to other tropical tree species. The findings in nodulation pattern and nitrogen fixing ability of these species are essential in their application in forest restoration on degraded lands.'

Abstract: 'In many tropical and volcanic soils, phosphorus (P) availability is strongly influenced by geochemical sorption, which binds P to soil minerals. The aim of this study was to determine whether biological demand or soil sorption strength was the primary control over phosphate availability and retention in a wet tropical soil with high sorption capacity and low P availability. We added 32PO4 to soil from the upper two horizons and assessed the ability of soil microbes to immobilize the added phosphate in the presence of strong sorption. We added phosphate at two concentrations, one representing background turnover that adds low concentrations of P to the soil solution, and the other representing nutrient pulses that can add fairly high fluxes of P to the soil solution. Sorption and microbial immobilization were rapid for both concentrations, consuming most added P within 30 min. Thus, little P remained in the soil solution or extractable pools, which are considered more available to plants. Although soil sorption strength was almost identical for the two horizons, immobilization of tracer P was approximately three times greater in the upper horizon, where most microbial activity was located. This result suggests that microbial demand controlled how P was partitioned into biological versus geochemical sinks. Further evidence for microbial control is suggested by the movement of tracer P from the sorbed pool into the microbial pool when demand was stimulated by the addition of carbon (C). We also explored how increased nitrogen (N) and P availability changed P dynamics in this nutrient poor soil. In contrast to the unfertilized soil, long-term N and P fertilization substantially reduced biological control over inorganic P. P fertilization saturated the soils, overwhelming biological P demand, whereas N fertilization appeared to increase available P through reduced P sorption. Where biological demand for P is high and P becomes available in the soil solution, microbes may play an important role in controlling P partitioning into biological versus geochemical sinks even in soils that have high sorption capacity.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the literature on how biodiversity contributes to improved and diversified diets in developing countries. We assess the current state of evidence on how wild and cultivated biodiversity in all forms is related to healthy diets and nutrition, and examine how economic factors, knowledge and social norms interact with availability of biodiversity to influence both production and consumption choices. The paper identifies areas where evidence is lacking and ways to build synergies between nutrition-sensitive approaches and efforts to ensure sustainability of food systems and the natural environment.'

Abstract: "White-nosed bearded sakis (Chiropotes albinasus) are endemic to the Madeira\xe2\x80\x93Xing\xc3\xba interfluvium in southern Amazonia, though recent fieldwork has produced conflicting data on the southwestern limits of the species's geographic range. We reevaluated the distribution of bearded sakis on the basis of surveys from 34 sites throughout the Brazilian state of Rond\xc3\xb4nia. Chiropotes albinasus occurred at seven sites in the eastern part of the state, including two west of the Jiparan\xc3\xa1\xe2\x80\x93Pimenta Bueno river system in the extreme south, but there is no record of their presence further north and west in the Jiparan\xc3\xa1\xe2\x80\x93Guapor\xc3\xa9 interfluvium and they were absent from the Jiparan\xc3\xa1\xe2\x80\x93Mamor\xc3\xa9 interfluvium. The data suggest that ecological, rather than geographic barriers restrict the distribution of Chiropotes albinasus in southern Rond\xc3\xb4nia, but are contradictory with regard to the possible determining factors. Chiropotes albinasus appears able to thrive in transitional, savanna-like ecosystems in southern Rond\xc3\xb4nia, but is unexpectedly absent from adjacent areas of terra firme forest. Syntopy with the only other pitheciine found in the state (Pithecia irrorata) appears to have a negative effect on the abundance of Chiropotes albinasus which implies that interspecific competition may reinforce a complex of limiting factors, such as the availability of key plant species. Despite showing that Chiropotes albinasus is widespread in southern Rond\xc3\xb4nia, we also confirm its absence from the western two thirds of the state, a significant reduction in the known range of the species."

Abstract: 'This paper examines social determinants of resource competition among Tsimane Amerindian women of Bolivia. We introduce a semi-anonymous experiment (the Social Strategy Game) designed to simulate resource competition among women. Information concerning dyadic social relationships and demographic data were collected to identify variables influencing resource competition intensity, as measured by the number of beads one woman took from another. Relationship variables are used to test how the affiliative or competitive aspects of dyads affect the extent of prosociality in the game. Using a mixed-modeling procedure, we find that women compete with those with whom they are quarreling over accusations of meat theft, mate competition, and rumor spreading. They also compete with members of their social network and with those who were designated as cooperative helpers or as close kin. Women take fewer beads from desired friends, neighbors, and from those viewed as enemies. We interpret favoritism toward enemies as resulting from fear of retribution. Our results suggest that social relations among women are multifaceted and often cannot be simplified by exclusive focus on genetic relatedness, physical proximity, or reciprocity. We argue that a complex understanding of cooperation and competition among women may require important contextual information concerning relationship history in addition to typical features of resource ecology.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian SUS (Unified Health System) was created in 1988 within the new constitution, based on the premises of being universal, comprehensive, and equitable. The SUS offers free health care, independent of contribution or affiliation. Since then, great efforts and increasing investments have been made for the system to achieve its goals. We assessed how coverage and equity in selected reproductive and maternal interventions progressed in Brazil from 1986 to 2013.'

Abstract: '\nPolymorphism studies concerning HVI and HVII regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have improved the understanding of the admixture genetic process related to the occupation of the continents by human population groups. We have analyzed the mtDNA lineages of 190 healthy and maternally unrelated individuals born in the metropolitan region of the Rio de Janeiro city, the capital of the State of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. The data showing that 57.9, 25.3 and 16.8\xc2\xa0% of the matrilineages found in Rio de Janeiro come from African, Amerindian and European population groups. They are, respectively, in close agreement with historical records which indicate that the admixture population of Brazil is the resulting of interethnic asymmetry crosses between individuals from those population groups. The high proportion of African mtDNA lineages in the population of Rio de Janeiro is in accordance with studies related to other Brazilian states.'

Abstract: 'A cacao (Theobroma cacao) plantation under shade trees was studied in northern Venezuela in order to estimate nitrogen stores in the soil and plantation trees and nitrogen fluxes associated with litterfall, decomposition and harvest. The cacao plants contained 302 kg N ha\xe2\x88\x921, of which woody above-ground parts made up 50%. Fine roots and leaves containedca. 60 kg N ha\xe2\x88\x921.

Shade tree leaves made up 61% of the total nitrogen in the litter on the soil. Mineral soil stores of total nitrogen were 35\xc3\x97103 kg N ha\xe2\x88\x921, 40% of which was found in the first 20 cm depth.'

Abstract: 'The image texture was extracted from Landsat TM data using rodogram, a geostatistical function, and then added to multispectral classification for lithological discrimination of an arid region, the Altun Mountains in northwest China. The variogram analysis of the image of the study area indicates that the image has two scales of textures: local and regional textures. Therefore, two different window sizes, 17\xc3\x9717 pixels and 61\xc3\x9761 pixels were chosen to extract textural information using rodogram. The results of image classification show that the classification based on spectral data and geostatistical textural information produced much higher overall accuracy than with the spectral classification alone. Moreover, large window size, at which textural information was extracted and then used for image classification, achieved more accurate result than small window size.'

Abstract: 'I study the problem faced by an asymmetrically informed supranational governmental authority (SNGA) with limited funds that wishes to design an international environmental agreement (IEA) for less developed countries (LDCs). The SNGA cannot contract directly with polluting firms in the various LDCs, but it must deal with such firms through their national governments. I study this tripartite hierarchical interaction for two LDCs. My principal result is that despite the perfect correlation in the private information of the governments and the firms across the two countries, and in contrast with the result contained in Batabyal (1998a), the SNGA cannot implement a first-best IEA.'

Abstract: 'Soil degradation affects human nutrition and health through its adverse impacts on quantity and quality of food production. Decline in crops\xe2\x80\x99 yields and agronomic production exacerbate food-insecurity that currently affects 854 million people globally, and low concentration of protein and micronutrients (e.g., Zn, Fe, Se, B, I) aggravate malnutrition and hidden hunger that affects 3.7 billion people, especially children. Soil degradation reduces crop yields by increasing susceptibility to drought stress and elemental imbalance. Strategies include: improving water productivity, enhancing soil fertility and micronutrient availability, adopting no-till farming and conservation agriculture and adapting to climate change. There are also new innovations such as using remote sensing of plant nutritional stresses for targeted interventions, applying zeolites and nanoenhanced fertilizers and delivery systems, improving biological nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizal inoculation, conserving and recycling (e.g., waste water) water using drip/sub-drip irrigation etc. Judiciously managed and properly restored, world soils have the capacity to grow adequate and nutritious food for present and future populations.'

Abstract: 'Land-based emissions of carbon dioxide derive from the interface of forest and agriculture. Emission estimates require harmonization across forest and non-forest data sources. Furthermore, emission reduction requires understanding of the linked causes and policy levers between agriculture and forestry. The institutional forestry traditions dominated the emergence of the discourse on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) while more holistic perspectives on land-based emissions, including agriculture, found a home in international recognition for Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). We tested the hypothesis that, at least for Indonesia, the NAMA framework provides opportunities to resolve issues that REDD+ alone cannot address. We reviewed progress on five major challenges identified in 2007 by the Indonesian Forest Climate Alliance: 1) scope and \xe2\x80\x98forest\xe2\x80\x99 definition; 2) ownership and tenurial rights; 3) multiplicity and interconnectedness of drivers; 4) peatland issues across forest and non-forest land categories; and 5) fairness and efficiency of benefit-distribution mechanisms across conservation, degradation and restoration phases of tree-cover transition. Results indicate that the two policy instruments developed in parallel with competition rather than synergy. Three of the REDD+ challenges can be resolved by treating REDD+ as a subset of the NAMA and national emission reduction plans for Indonesia. We conclude that two issues, rights and benefit distribution, remain a major challenge, and require progress on a motivational pyramid of policy and polycentric governance. National interest in retaining global palm oil exports gained priority over expectations of REDD forest rents. Genuine concerns over climate change motivate a small but influential part of the ongoing debate.'

Abstract: 'Since the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), the riparian zone has been subjected to numerous environmental changes. This study was conducted to recognize the distribution of grass roots and its impacts on soil nutrients in the water level fluctuation zone of TGR. Roots of four predominant herbaceous plants in the study area, specifically, Cynodon dactylon, Hemarthria altissima, Hemarthria compressa, and Paspalum paspaloides, and their corresponding relation with soil nutrient contents were investigated. Root surface area density was determined with WinRHIZO, and the relationships of root distribution with soil depths and soil nutrient contents were studied. The results indicates that most roots are distributed in the top soil layer of 0\xe2\x80\x9310 cm. Estimated root surface area density for the selected grass species ranges from 0.16 to 13.44 cm2/cm3, and decreases exponentially with an increase in soil depth. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen contents are significantly lower on bare control area than the corresponding values on the grasslands. Total nutrient contents on grasslands of C. dactylon and H. compressa are higher than those of other grass areas. Root length density and root surface area density are significantly correlated with soil organic matter and total nitrogen content for the four grasslands. The present results suggests that plant roots have significant effects on the distribution of soil nutrients in soil profiles in the riparian zone along the TGR. Nevertheless, additional investigations are needed to reveal the specific interactions between plant roots distribution, soil nutrients and water level fluctuations.'

Abstract: 'Tropical and sub tropical regions are regarded as dominant source of biogenic volatile organic compounds emission (BVOC). However, measurement studies from these regions are limited and largely confined to South Africa and Amazonia. Consequently, global BVOC estimates are mainly based on modeling studies. Moreover, BVOC emission estimate is altogether lacking for any region of the Indian sub continent. This study attempts to estimate isoprene emission capacity of forest of Haryana state. Individual plant species isoprene emission capacity is found to vary from below detection limit (BDL) to 12.01 mg Cm\xe2\x88\x92 2 h\xe2\x88\x92 1. Maximum emission capacity (12.01 mg Cm\xe2\x88\x92 2 h\xe2\x88\x92 1) is noticed in case of Dalbergia sissoo. The area average isoprene emission capacity for the Haryana forest is found to be 19.98 mg Cm\xe2\x88\x92 2 h\xe2\x88\x92 1, which is significantly (2.4 times) higher than the reported isoprene emission value of 8.2 mg Cm\xe2\x88\x92 2 h\xe2\x88\x92 1 for the Kalahari woodland of Africa.'

Abstract: 'Ensemble techniques, common in many disciplines, have yet to be fully exploited with spatially explicit projections from land-change models. We trial a land-change model ensemble to assess the impact of policies designed to conserve tropical rainforest at the municipality scale in Brazil, noting the achievements made and challenges ahead. Four spatial model frameworks that were calibrated with the same predictor variables produced 21 counterfactual simulations of the actual landscape. Individual projections with a uniform calibration period gave estimates that between 29 and 68% of the simulated deforestation was saved, but lacked an uncertainty estimate, whilst batch projections from two different model frameworks provided a more dependable mean estimate that 38 and 49% deforestation was prevented with an uncertainty range of 1900 and 1000\xc2\xa0km2. The consensus ensembles used agreement between the projections and found that the seven examples with a uniform calibration period produced an error margin of \xc2\xb1435.94\xc2\xa0km2 and a prevented forest loss estimate of 50%. Using all 21 projections with diverse calibration periods improved these errors to \xc2\xb1179.26\xc2\xa0km2 with a 53% estimate of prevented forest loss. Whilst we achieved a method of combining projections of different frameworks to reduce uncertainty of individual modelling frameworks, demonstrating a control model and accounting for non-linear conditions are challenges that will provide better confidence in this method as an operational tool. Such retrospective evidence could be used to make timely rewards for efforts of governments and municipalities to support tropical forest conservation and help mitigate deforestation.'

Abstract: 'Oxidative stress and DNA damage are involved in the glyphosate-based herbicide toxicity. Uncaria tomentosa (UT; Rubiaceae) is a plant species from South America containing bioactive compounds with known beneficial properties. The objective of this work was to evaluate the antioxidant and antigenotoxic potential of UT extract in a model of acute exposure to glyphosate-Roundup\xc2\xae (GR) in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We showed that UT (1.0\xc2\xa0mg/mL) prevented the decrease of brain total thiols, the increase of lipid peroxidation in both brain and liver, and the decrease of liver GPx activity caused after 96\xc2\xa0h of GR (5.0\xc2\xa0mg/L) exposure. In addition, UT partially protected against the increase of micronucleus frequency induced by GR exposure in fish brain. Overall, our results indicate that UT protects against damage induced by a glyphosate-based herbicide by providing antioxidant and antigenotoxic effects, which may be related to the phenolic compounds identified in the extract.'

Abstract: 'The potential for the mean climate of the tropical Pacific to shift to more El Ni\xc3\xb1o-like conditions as a result of human induced climate change is subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. The complexity of the feedback processes, the wide range of responses of different atmosphere\xe2\x80\x93ocean global circulation models (AOGCMs) and difficulties with model simulation of present day El Ni\xc3\xb1o southern oscillation (ENSO), all complicate the picture. By examining the components of the climate-change response that projects onto the model pattern of ENSO variability in 20 AOGCMs submitted to the coupled model inter-comparison project (CMIP), it is shown that large-scale coupled atmosphere\xe2\x80\x93ocean feedbacks associated with the present day ENSO also operate on longer climate-change time scales. By linking the realism of the simulation of present day ENSO variability in the models to their patterns of future mean El Ni\xc3\xb1o-like or La Ni\xc3\xb1a-like climate change, it is found that those models that have the largest ENSO-like climate change also have the poorest simulation of ENSO variability. The most likely scenario (p=0.59) in a model-skill-weighted histogram of CMIP models is for no trend towards either mean El Ni\xc3\xb1o-like or La Ni\xc3\xb1a-like conditions. However, there remains a small probability (p=0.16) for a change to El Ni\xc3\xb1o-like conditions of the order of one standard El Ni\xc3\xb1o per century in the 1% per year CO2 increase scenario.'

Abstract: 'Euglossine fauna of a large remnant of Brazilian Atlantic forest in eastern Brazil (Reserva Natural Vale) was assessed along an edge-forest gradient towards the interior of the fragment. To test the hypotheses that the structure of assemblages of orchid bees varies along this gradient, the following predictions were evaluated: (i) species richness is positively related to distance from the forest edge, (ii) species diversity is positively related to distance from the edge, (iii) the relative abundance of species associated with forest edge and/or open areas is inversely related to the distance from edge, and (iv) relative abundance of forest-related species is positively related to distance from the edge. A total of 2264 bees of 25 species was assessed at five distances from the edge: 0\xc2\xa0m (the edge itself), 100\xc2\xa0m, 500\xc2\xa0m, 1000\xc2\xa0m and 1500\xc2\xa0m. Data suggested the existence of an edge-interior gradient for euglossine bees regarding species diversity and composition (considering the relative abundance of edge and forest-related species as a proxy for species composition) but not species richness.'

Abstract: 'More than 550 million of the current 1.1 billion people earning less than $1-a-day earn a living from agriculture in developing countries. A revolution in water control is needed to develop and mass-disseminate new, affordable, small-plot irrigation technologies. A revolution in agriculture is required to enable smallholders to produce high-value, marketable, labor-intensive cash crops. A revolution in markets is needed to open access to markets for the crops they produce and the inputs they need to produce them. Finally, a revolution in design, based on the ruthless pursuit of affordability, is needed to harness shallow groundwater. The experiences of suppliers of treadle pumps, low-cost drip irrigation and water storage systems were examined. The wealth these technologies generated, coupled with falling prices for small diesel pumps in countries like India and China, created a suitable environment for the rapid adoption of affordable diesel pump tubewells, which in turn created vigorous water markets and expanded access to affordable irrigation water for smallholders. The combination of smallholder-centered revolutions, along with the \xe2\x80\x98silent revolution in groundwater\xe2\x80\x99 described by Llamas and Martinez-Santos (Water Sci Technol 51(8):167\xe2\x80\x93174, 2005) provide new practical options for meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals on poverty and hunger by 2015.'

Abstract: 'The Atlantic Forest has been deforested to the point that only about 7% of the original forest remains. Soil degradation, including loss of soil organic carbon (SOC), has often been associated with deforestation. In extensive areas previously occupied by Atlantic Forest the soil has a naturally compact subsoil horizon called the coeso. This layer challenges root development and plant productivity. The purpose of this study was to investigate soil carbon and selected physical characteristics under the influence of the native forest and post-deforestation agricultural practices. The management regimes were a native forest, a rubber tree plantation, a pasture and annual cropping. Two soil depths were investigated: 0 to 15\xc2\xa0cm, corresponding to the A horizon; and 35 to 50\xc2\xa0cm, corresponding to the coeso. Management influenced both SOC concentration and soil bulk density; however, SOC content was not significantly changed by any of the post-deforestation land uses. This result supports the annual cropping system that has been adapted by small landholders. Most interesting was the quantity of SOC found in the coeso, which was as much as 50% of the surface horizon.'

Difficulties in responding to external peer review advice suggests that institutional constraints are hindering re-direction of the study.'

Abstract: 'The aim of this study was to detect DNA and antibodies anti-Leishmania spp., Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii in captive and free-range crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) from northeastern Brazil. Twenty-five crab-eating foxes from different states of northeastern Brazil were sampled by this study. Blood samples were collected by cephalic or jugular vein punctures. The whole blood was submitted to PCR, and the sera samples to the serological analysis as follows: MAT for T. gondii, NAT for N. caninum, and ELISA for L. chagasi. The frequence of antibodies anti-T. gondii was 50% and 29.41% for free-range and captive wild canids, respectively. The frequence of antibodies anti-N. caninum observed by this study was 62.50% and 23.52% for free-range and captive wild canids, respectively. The frequence of antibodies anti-L. chagasi was 4.0% for captive wild canids. Co-infections cases were identified as follows: one captive wild canid seropositive for T. gondii and L. chagasi and two free-range animals seropositive for T. gondii and N. caninum. All PCR assays performed were negative for the pathogens analyzed. This study describes the presence of antibodies anti-T. gondii, N. caninum e L. chagasi in wild canids from northeastern Brazil and highlights the necessity of further studies on infectious diseases in free-range and captive wild canids.'

Abstract: 'There are four basic management options for surface-mined land: (a)restoration to original condition; (b)rehabilitation of some desirable characteristics; (c) development ofalternative ecosystems that may be quite unlike the original but may be desirable for a variety of reasons; (d)neglect ornatural reclamation when evidence suggests that unaided natural processes will produce better results than human intervention. Checklists are provided so that essential information will be available in selecting the most suitable option.'

Abstract: 'Current studies on large-scale remotely sensed images are of great national importance for monitoring and evaluating global climate and ecological changes. In particular, real time distributed high-performance visualization and computation have become indispensable research components in facilitating the extraction of remotely sensed image textures to enable mining spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of landscapes from massive geo-digital information collected from satellites. Remotely sensed images are usually highly correlated with rich landscape features. By exploiting the structures of these images and extracting their textures, fundamental insights of the landscape can be derived. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary collaboration on the remotely sensed image analysis demands multifarious expertise in a wide spectrum of fields including geography, computer science, and engineering.'

Abstract: 'The endophytic fungi represent a potential source of microorganisms for enzyme production. However, there have been only few studies exploiting their potential for the production of enzymes of industrial interest, such as the (hemi)cellulolytic enzymatic cocktail required in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Here, a collection of endophytic fungi isolated from mangrove tropical forests was evaluated for the production of carbohydrolases and performance on the hydrolysis of cellulose. For that, 41 endophytic strains were initially screened using a plate assay containing crystalline cellulose as the sole carbon source and the selected strains were cultivated under solid-state fermentation for endoglucanase, \xce\xb2-glucosidase, and xylanase enzyme quantification. The hydrolysis of a cellulosic material with the enzymes from endophytic strains of the Aspergillus genus resulted in glucose and conversion values more than twofold higher than the reference strains (Aspergillus niger F12 and Trichoderma reesei Rut-C30). Particularly, the enzymes from strains A. niger 56 (3) and A. awamori 82 (4) showed a distinguished saccharification performance, reaching cellulose conversion values of about 35% after 24\xc2\xa0h. Linking hydrolysis performance to the screening steps played an important role towards finding potential fungal strains for producing enzymatic cocktails with high saccharification efficiency. These results indicate the potential of mangrove-associated endophytic fungi for production of carbohydrolases with efficient performance in the hydrolysis of biomass, thus contributing to the implementation of future biorefineries.'

Abstract: 'The International Workshop on Reducing Vulnerability of Agriculture and Forestry to Climate Variability and Climate Change held in Ljubljana, Solvenia, from 7 to 9 October 2002 addressed a range of important issues relating to climate variability, climate change, agriculture, and forestry including the state of agriculture and forestry and agrometeological information, and potential adaptation strategies for agriculture and forestry to changing climate conditions and other pressures. There is evidence that global warming over the last millennium has already resulted in increased global average annual temperature and changes in rainfall, with the 1990s being likely the warmest decade in the Northern Hemisphere at least. During the past century, changes in temperature patterns have, for example, had a direct impact on the number of frost days and the length of growing seasons with significant implications for agriculture and forestry. Land cover changes, changes in global ocean circulation and sea surface temperature patterns, and changes in the composition of the global atmosphere are leading to changes in rainfall. These changes may be more pronounced in the tropics. For example, crop varieties grown in the Sahel may not be able to withstand the projected warming trends and will certainly be at risk due to projected lower amounts of rainfall as well. Seasonal to interannual climate forecasts will definitely improve in the future with a better understanding of dynamic relationships. However, the main issue at present is how to make better use of the existing information and dispersion of knowledge to the farm level. Direct participation by the farming communities in pilot projects on agrometeorological services will be essential to determine the actual value of forecasts and to better identify the specific user needs. Old (visits, extension radio) and new (internet) communication techniques, when adapted to local applications, may assist in the dissemination of useful information to the farmers and decision makers. Some farming systems with an inherent resilience may adapt more readily to climate pressures, making long-term adjustments to varying and changing conditions. Other systems will need interventions for adaptation that should be more strongly supported by agrometeorological services for agricultural producers. This applies, among others, to systems where pests and diseases play an important role. Scientists have to guide policy makers in fostering an environment in which adaptation strategies can be effected. There is a clear need for integrating preparedness for climate variability and climate change. In developed countries, a trend of higher yields, but with greater annual fluctuations and changes in cropping patterns and crop calendars can be expected with changing climate scenarios. Shifts in projected cropping patterns can be disruptive to rural societies in general. However, developed countries have the technology to adapt more readily to the projected climate changes. In many developing countries, the present conditions of agriculture and forestry are already marginal, due to degradation of natural resources, the use of inappropriate technologies and other stresses. For these reasons, the ability to adapt will be more difficult in the tropics and subtropics and in countries in transition. Food security will remain a problem in many developing countries. Nevertheless, there are many examples of traditional knowledge, indigenous technologies and local innovations that can be used effectively as a foundation for improved farming systems. Before developing adaptation strategies, it is essential to learn from the actual difficulties faced by farmers to cope with risk management at the farm level. Agrometeorologists must play an important role in assisting farmers with the development of feasible strategies to adapt to climate variability and climate change. Agrometeorologists should also advise national policy makers on the urgent need to cope with the vulnerabilities of agriculture and forestry to climate variability and climate change. The workshop recommendations were largely limited to adaptation. Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate variability and climate change is of high priority for nearly all countries, but developing countries are particularly vulnerable. Effective measures to cope with vulnerability and adaptation need to be developed at all levels. Capacity building must be integrated into adaptation measures for sustainable agricultural development strategies. Consequently, nations must develop strategies that effectively focus on specific regional issues to promote sustainable development.'

Abstract: 'Quantification of spatially and temporally resolved water flows and water storage variations for all land areas of the globe is required to assess water resources, water scarcity and flood hazards, and to understand the Earth system. This quantification is done with the help of global hydrological models (GHMs). What are the challenges and prospects in the development and application of GHMs? Seven important challenges are presented. (1) Data scarcity makes quantification of human water use difficult even though significant progress has been achieved in the last decade. (2) Uncertainty of meteorological input data strongly affects model outputs. (3) The reaction of vegetation to changing climate and CO2 concentrations is uncertain and not taken into account in most GHMs that serve to estimate climate change impacts. (4) Reasons for discrepant responses of GHMs to changing climate have yet to be identified. (5) More accurate estimates of monthly time series of water availability and use are needed to provide good indicators of water scarcity. (6) Integration of gradient-based groundwater modelling into GHMs is necessary for a better simulation of groundwater\xe2\x80\x93surface water interactions and capillary rise. (7) Detection and attribution of human interference with freshwater systems by using GHMs are constrained by data of insufficient quality but also GHM uncertainty itself. Regarding prospects for progress, we propose to decrease the uncertainty of GHM output by making better use of in situ and remotely sensed observations of output variables such as river discharge or total water storage variations by multi-criteria validation, calibration or data assimilation. Finally, we present an initiative that works towards the vision of hyperresolution global hydrological modelling where GHM outputs would be provided at a 1-km resolution with reasonable accuracy.'

Abstract: ' We assessed density- and distance-dependence in herbivore effects and juvenile condition for four species of Shorea, the most speciose genus in the dominant canopy family of southeast Asian rain forest trees (Dipterocarpaceae). Herbivore damage was quantified as partial leaf loss on young leaves, and whole plant foliar condition as the product of the fraction of leaf nodes containing leaves and the fraction of tissue remaining on extant leaves. Adults of the four species were centers of high total, as well as conspecific, density of juveniles (<1\xe2\x80\x89m tall). For two species, S. hopeifolia and S. pinanga, herbivore damage declined significantly with distance, decreasing by 40% and 51% respectively, between 5\xe2\x80\x89m and 35\xe2\x80\x89m from the parent. For the same two species, foliar condition improved significantly between 5\xe2\x80\x89m and 35\xe2\x80\x89m, increasing by 45% for S. hopeifolia and 24% for S. pinanga. If foliar condition influences juvenile survival and growth, more widely dispersed seeds of these species are more likely to recruit to the canopy. In contrast, there was no significant distance-dependence for S. parvifolia or S. longisperma. Among species, herbivore damage was greatest in those species with greatest local juvenile abundances, i.e., those with highest densities, leaf size, juvenile foliar mass and/ or foliar mass/m2 ground area, but was unrelated to the toughness of mature leaves. However, distance was a better predictor of herbivore damage than was conspecific juvenile density, as evaluated by backward elimination regressions, for both S. hopeifolia and S. pinanga. For foliar condition, the best predictor was distance for S. pinanga, but conspecific density for S. hopeifolia, whose juveniles were smallest and occurred at the highest densities. Total juvenile density (all woody plants) was eliminated as a factor in all cases. The species-specificity of effects (i.e., their dependence on conspecific distance or density), together with the marked differences among congeneric species, caution against generalizations regarding distance-dependent effects in diverse forests.'

Abstract: 'Climate change programs have largely used the project-specific approach for estimating baseline emissions of climate mitigation projects. This approach is subjective, lacks transparency, can generate inconsistent baselines for similar projects, and is likely to have high transaction costs. The use of regional baselines, which partially addresses these issues, has been reported in the literature on forestry and agriculture projects, and in greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation program guidance for them (e.g., WRI/WBCSD GHG Project Protocol, USDOE\xe2\x80\x99s 1605(b) registry, UNFCCC\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Development Mechanism). This paper provides an assessment of project-specific and regional baselines approaches for key baseline tasks, using project and program examples. The regional experience to date is then synthesized into generic steps that are referred to as Stratified Regional Baselines (SRB). Regional approaches generally, and SRB in particular explicitly acknowledge the heterogeneity of carbon density, land use change, and other key baseline driver variables across a landscape. SRB focuses on providing guidance on how to stratify lands into parcels with relatively homogeneous characteristics to estimate conservative baselines within a GHG assessment boundary, by applying systematic methods to determine the boundary and time period for input data.'

Abstract: 'Beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forest covers about 565,000 ha of land in Guilan province, north of Iran and forms a major carbon pool. It is an important economic, soil protection and recreation resource. We studied long-term effects of fire on the structure and composition 37 years after fire occurrence in these forests. To do this research, we selected 85 ha burned and 85 ha unburned beech forests). The results indicated that the fire had not changed the overall uneven-aged structure, but it changed forest composition from pure stands to mixed stands that now include species such as Carpinus betulus, Acer cappadocicum and Alnus subcordata. The density of trees and regeneration was significantly increased, while the density of shrubs significantly decreased. The main reasons for increased tree regeneration were attributed to (1) reduction of litter depth, and (2) increase in available light from opening of the canopy and reduction in shrub competition. It is apparent that the forest is on a path to return to its natural state before the fire after 37 years.'

Abstract: 'Over the last 15\xc2\xa0years, there has been a significant increase in the availability of ICTs in developing countries. Indicatively, it is estimated that fixed wired broadband internet subscriptions have increased from 71 to 357\xc2\xa0m between 2005 and 2013 (ITU, 2013). Most striking is the rapid uptake in mobile telephones. Mobile phone subscriptions in developing nations have increased from 1213 to 5235\xc2\xa0m between 2005 and 2013, while active mobile broadband subscription has increased rapidly from 43 to 1162\xc2\xa0m between 2007 and 2013 (ibid).'

Abstract: 'Using the data published in the Catalogue of the Flowering Plants and Gymnosperms of Peru, we analyzed the elevational distributions of 5323 species reported as endemics from that country as a whole, for 10 families with the highest number of endemic taxa in Peru, and the distribution patterns of these species according to life form. We calculated the density of endemism (number of endemic species divided by area \xc3\x97 1000) and absolute number of endemic species among life forms and families, along an elevational gradient. Overall densities of endemics were 10\xe2\x80\x9315 times higher at mid-elevation (2000\xe2\x80\x933500 m) than in the Amazonian lowlands (0\xe2\x80\x93500 m). Absolute numbers of endemics peaked at 1500\xe2\x80\x933000 m for herbs, shrubs, and epiphytes, while trees, vines, and lianas showed maxima in the lowlands (0\xe2\x80\x93500 m); yet densities of endemics for all life forms peaked at 1500\xe2\x80\x933000 m. Among the 10 families with the highest number of endemics, densities of endemics peaked at mid- to high elevation (1500\xe2\x80\x934500 m), but showed much disparity in the elevational distribution of absolute numbers of endemic species. Finally, the percentage of endemic species to total species is highest for herbs, shrubs, and epiphytes. Given that less than 10% of the land area for each of the montane zones (2000\xe2\x80\x934500 m) is protected compared to 13.5\xe2\x80\x9329.9% in the lower elevations (0\xe2\x80\x931000 m), we recommend that priority be given to increasing the size of protected areas at mid- to high altitude in the Andean slopes to grant further protection in zones with the highest density of endemics. We also recommend that more emphasis be given to collecting and studying non-trees, since most endemic species belong to that class.'

Abstract: 'The following question is addressed here: do healthy leaves absorb, as the spectra published over the last 50 years indicate, some 5\xe2\x80\x9320% of incident radiation in the 780\xe2\x80\x93900 nm region? The answer is found to be negative, and previous findings result from incomplete collection of the transmitted light by the detection system (even when the leaf is placed next to, but outside, the entrance port of an integrating sphere). A simple remedy for this inherent flaw in the experimental arrangement is applied successfully to leaves (of 10 unrelated species) differing in thickness, age and pigment content. The study has shown that, from an optical standpoint, a leaf tissue is a highly scattering material, and the infinite reflectance of a leaf is exceedingly sensitive to trace amounts of absorbing components. It is shown that water contributes, in a thick leaf (Kalanchoe blossfeldiana), an easily detectable signal even in the 780\xe2\x80\x93900 nm region. The practical benefits resulting from improved measurements of leaf spectra are pointed out.'

Abstract: 'Phylogeny is associated with most aspects of the biology of primates and other animals, such as body form, locomotion, gross diet, and social behavior. Closely related organisms tend to be similar to one another. In this article we examine the extent to which the dietary overlap of individual primate species within a community reflects their phylogenetic relationships. That is, do closely related taxa of primates tend to eat parts of the same species and genera of plants? We collected dietary data and phylogenetic relationships from studies of primate communities at five sites: the Krau Game Reserve in Malaysia, Manu National Park in Peru, Raleighvalen-Voltsberg in Suriname, Kibale Forest in Uganda, and Tai Forest in Ivory Coast. On the basis of a Mantel test, matrices of dietary overlap and phylogenetic divergence dates show significant correlations (P < 0.05) between diet and divergence times in all communities except Manu. However, tests that compare branching sequences between cladograms of phylogeny and dendrograms of dietary similarity yield few clear results. The widespread correlations between consumption of specific plant taxa and phylogenetic relatedness in studies on different continents using various methods of data collection are a robust result and contrast with other studies finding a weak relationship between diet and phylogeny when diet is measured as proportions of fruit, leaves, and fauna. Further investigations of the relationship between diet and phylogeny could profit by careful design of uniform sampling strategies and consideration of additional factors such as seasonality and food availability.'

Abstract: 'Land use systems in the Northeast Region of Brazil are dominated by large holdings and extensive cultivation of perennial crops such as cashew, coconut, carnauba wax palm, baba\xc3\xa7u palm and so on. The common feature which links these crops is the silvopastoral system of livestock (chiefly cattle, sheep and donkeys) grazing under them. Agrosilvicultural systems involving cultivation of annual subsistence crops, and in some instances other perennials, in the stands of these perennial crops is also common. The paper presents the available information on the management, production, rate of growth, economic importance, etc. of these agroforestry systems involving cashew, coconut and carnauba palm.'

Abstract: 'The latex obtained from Hancornia speciosa is used in folk medicine for treatment of several diseases, such as acne, warts, diabetes, gastritis and inflammation. In this work, we describe the biocompatibility assessment and angiogenic properties of H. speciosa latex and its potential application in medicine. The physical\xe2\x80\x93chemical characterization was carried out following different methodologies (CHN elemental analyses; thermogravimetric analyses and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). The biocompatibility was evaluated through cytotoxicity and genotoxicity tests in fibroblast mouse cells and the angiogenic properties were evaluated using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay model. The physical\xe2\x80\x93chemical results showed that the structure of Hancornia speciosa latex biomembrane is very similar to that of Hevea brasiliensis (commercially available product). Moreover, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays showed that H. speciosa latex is biocompatible with life systems and can be a good biomaterial for medical applications. The CAM test showed the efficient ability of H. speciosa latex in neovascularization of tissues. The histological analysis was in accordance with the results obtained in the CAM assay. Our data indicate that the latex obtained from H. speciosa and eluted in water showed significant angiogenic activity without any cytotoxic or genotoxic effects on life systems. The same did not occur with H. speciosa latex stabilized with ammonia. Addition of ammonia does not have significant effects on the structure of biomembranes, but showed a smaller cell survival and a significant genotoxicity effect. This study contributes to the understanding of the potentialities of H. speciosa latex as a source of new phytomedicines.'

Abstract: 'We describe here a sensitive quantum cascade laser absorption spectrometer (QCLAS) employed for aircraft based measurements during the GABRIEL 2005 and HOOVER 2006 and 2007 campaigns. This 3-channel instrument measures CO, HCHO, CH4 and N2O using a 64-m path double corner cube White cell. Performance of the instrument was examined for the four species and precisions for CO, N2O and CH4 were measured in the field to be 0.5, 0.5 and 0.7% respectively (2\xcf\x83). The 1\xcf\x83 detection limit for HCHO was \xe2\x88\xbc500\xc2\xa0pptv for a 2\xc2\xa0s average, while signal averaging of the HCHO over a 2\xc2\xa0min time interval resulted in a 150\xc2\xa0pptv detection limit with a duty cycle of 60%.

Abstract: 'International wheat breeding began 60 years ago in the Mexican-Rockefeller Foundation Office of Special Studies. A novel technique of shuttle breeding was adopted in Mexico, enabling photoperiod sensitivity to be overcome, a pivotal step in creating internationally adapted spring wheat germplasm that eventually spread throughout the world. The high-yielding technologies developed in Mexico helped revolutionize cereal production during the 1960s and 1970s, and came to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d In the process, a highly effective system of international agricultural research centers evolved under the umbrella of the Consultative Group for International Agriculture (CGIAR). This international system has weakened in recent decades, despite the enormous challenges facing humankind to expand food production in environmentally sustainable ways. Biotechnology holds great promise to develop improved crop varieties to deal with new pests and diseases, drought, and to enhance nutritional content. Those on the food front still have a big job ahead of us to feed the world. There is no room for complacency.'

Abstract: 'A review of Astronium s.l. revealed a new species in section Astronium that is unusual because of its dwarf habit, presence of foliose bracts on the inflorescence, and sub-basal ovule placentation. Currently available collections suggest a disjunct distribution between the Brazilian states of Goi\xc3\xa1s and Rond\xc3\xb4nia and the northeastern part of the Bolivian department of Santa Cruz, but all on the Brazilian Shield. The new species is formally described and named as Astronium pumilum. The generic limits and morphological attributes of the sections of the genus are discussed, and a key to the known species is presented. A synopsis or revision of the genus is being prepared pending results from molecular systematic studies.'

Abstract: 'Hantavirus infection is an emerging zoonosis transmitted by wild rodents. In Brazil, high case-fatality rates among humans infected with hantavirus are of serious concern to public health authorities. Appropriate preventive measures partly depend on reliable knowledge about the geographical distribution of this disease.'

Abstract: 'Earlier experimental evidence indicates that some decision makers under-invest in information when it is costly. This insight is applied to the cost\xe2\x80\x93benefit analysis of the provision of data obtained by satellites. In fields like agriculture, remotely sensed information of great precision can be provided to additional farmers at minimal extra costs if a service for farmers with similar information needs is set up. Here, the tendency to under-invest in information asks for creative solutions by the private sector: bankers may work together with rational producers in setting up the information service and promoting it. However, if producers\xe2\x80\x99 financial resources are insufficient, public intervention, in the form of a free information service may be necessary.'

Abstract: 'This study investigates the most appropriate conditions to perform the proximate analysis (moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash) of biomasses by thermogravimetry, focusing on providing better distinction for quantification of volatile and fixed carbon components. It was found, using a series of thermogravimetric methodologies, that heating rate and particle size are important factors to be taken into account, whereas temperature and carrier gas (type and flow rate) are critical to enable the proper quantification of volatiles and fixed carbon. In this case, the best condition was achieved by applying 600\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and CO2 as carrier gas (instead of N2). It is the highlight of the proposal method regarding the conditions often applied for this purpose. Furthermore, this method has proved to be advantageous in three important aspects: A single measurement is enough for quantification of all properties, it can be performed in a short time (1\xc2\xa0h 27\xc2\xa0min) in comparison with methods performed in a muffle furnace, and it can be applied for different kinds of biomasses, from lignocellulosic to residues. The procedure of validation demonstrated the low uncertainty of the data obtained by this method and the low propagation of uncertainty when they were applied for the prediction of the high heating value of the related biomasses, which supports its applicability as an alternative to biomass characterization.'

Abstract: 'There is a range of forest management systems between pure extraction and plantation systems. Such \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate systems\xe2\x80\x9d range from wild forests modified for increased production of selected products to anthropogenic forests with a high-density of valuable species growing within a relatively diverse and complex structure. These systems, classed here as \xe2\x80\x9cForest Garden Systems\xe2\x80\x9d (FGS), have important socioeconomic and ecological benefits, and yet they have been largely overlooked by researchers, development practitioners, and policy makers. Based on case examples and the authors\xe2\x80\x99 experience, this paper analyzes the socioeconomic and institutional factors that explain the development, persistence, and decline of FGS. These systems combine productivity and biodiversity values and are important components in the diverse economic systems of their managers. As such, the model warrants increased attention to protect existing values, to support the adaptation of existing systems to changing circumstances, and to inform the development of new models of integrated forest management'

Abstract: 'The quantification of ant nest densities is a useful but challenging task given the group\xe2\x80\x99s high abundance and diversity of nesting sites. We present a new application of a distance-sampling method which follows standard distance analytical procedures, but introduces a sampling innovation that is particularly useful for ants; instead of having an observer look for ants we let ants find a bait station and measure the distances covered between nest and station. We test this method by estimating the density of epigaeic ant nests in an Amazon tropical forest site near Manaus, Brazil. We distributed 220 baits of canned sardine mixed with cassava flour among 10, 210-m long transects in old-growth upland forest. Forty-five minutes after baiting, we followed the ants\xe2\x80\x99 trails and measured the linear distance between the bait and each nest\xe2\x80\x99s entrance. We then used the freely available program DISTANCE to estimate the number of nests per unit area while accounting for the effect of distance on the probability that a colony will find a bait. There were found 38 species nesting in 287 different colonies, with an estimated 2.66 nests/m2. This estimate fell within the 95\xc2\xa0% confidence bounds of nest density predicted for a similar number of species based on a literature survey of ant species richness and nest density. Our sampling solution, however, takes less than 30\xc2\xa0% of the time used by conventional sampling approaches for a similar area, with the advantage that it produces not only a point estimate but also a quantification of uncertainty about density.'

Abstract: 'This paper describes West African farming practices and knowledge that lead to the formation of carbon-rich high-fertility African Dark Earths (AfDE) \xe2\x80\x93 human-made soils analogous to Amazonian terra preta, yet subject to continuing production and use. Gender relations and women\xe2\x80\x99s roles are central to how these soils are produced and used. Through social and ecological field studies in Liberia and Sierra Leone we detail how AfDE formation and associated knowledge is gender-differentiated, the central roles of women\xe2\x80\x99s deposition of charred organic materials from cooking, oil palm processing and potash production in producing AfDE, and the gendered dynamics of AfDE use and distribution in the landscape. Different species are cultivated in AfDE compared to non-anthropogenic soils, and AfDE are differentially valued by women and men for horticultural and tree crops. The spatial distribution of AfDE across the landscape reflects shifting household, marriage and settlement practices. Gender relations, subjectivities and interdependencies and the ecology of soils and landscapes mutually shape one another. National policymakers and NGOs planning or managing agricultural carbon projects in West Africa should attend to the knowledge and practices of Loma and Mende women and men who have made and cultivated carbon-rich anthropogenic soils in the region for generations.'

Abstract: "Forest fragmentation in tropical ecosystems can alter nutrient cycling in diverse ways. We have analysed the effects of the forest-pasture edge on nutrient soil dynamics in a tropical deciduous forest (TDF) in Mexico. In two remnant forest fragments, both larger than 10\xc2\xa0ha, litterfall, litter and soil samples associated to the tree Caesalpinia eriostachys were collected at five distances from the pasture edge into the inner forest (10\xc2\xa0m in the pasture and 0\xe2\x80\x9310, 30\xe2\x80\x9340, 70\xe2\x80\x9380 and 100\xe2\x80\x93110\xc2\xa0m towards the forest interior). We measured the concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in litterfall, surface litter and soil, and soil microbial C (Cmic) and microbial N (Nmic). Soil nutrient concentrations and Cmic and Nmic were lower in the pasture soils than in the forest soil samples. Total C and N pools, and Cmic and Nmic in the pasture were lower than in the forest. In contrast, net N immobilization and the increase in Nmic from rain to dry season increased from the edge to the inner forest. Soil P concentration was lower in the pasture and at the first distance class in the forest margin (0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0m) than in the sites located further into the forest, while litter P concentration had the inverse pattern. Litterfall P was also reduced near the edge and increased towards the forest interior. As a consequence, litterfall C:P and N:P ratios decreased from the edge to the inner forest. These results suggest that the forest\xe2\x80\x93pasture edge disrupts P dynamics within the first 10\xc2\xa0m in the forest. Thus, plants' use of nutrients and productivity could be altered in the edge of fragmented forests."

Abstract: 'Field observations of the atmospheric boundary layer were made over urban and suburban terrain in the Yangtze River Delta, China. A multiresolution decomposition was applied over three different types of terrain: flat homogeneous terrain, suburban terrain and urban terrain, with results indicating that, (1) the average scale contribution of u, v, w and \\(T_{v}\\) had a similar variability with length scale for all these three sites respectively, and the dimensionless length scale corresponding to the maximum sensible heat flux contribution increased with the terrain complexity; (2) the length scale corresponding to the maximal average scale contribution for vertical wind velocity \\(\\lambda _w \\) was directly proportional to the roughness length \\(z_{0}\\) in unstable conditions; and (3) the contributions of large-scale motions led to sensible heat fluxes determined with a large-aperture scintillomter being larger than those using the eddy-covariance method for the suburban case, whereas this phenomenon was not substantial for the urban case.'

Abstract: 'Biological systems are highly complex, and for this reason there is a considerable degree of uncertainty as to the consequences of making significant interventions into their workings. Since a number of new technologies are already impinging on living systems, including our bodies, many of us have become participants in large-scale \xe2\x80\x9csocial experiments\xe2\x80\x9d. I will discuss biological complexity and its relevance to the technologies that brought us BSE/vCJD and the controversy over GM foods. Then I will consider some of the complexities of our social dynamics, and argue for making a shift from using the precautionary principle to employing the approach of evaluating the introduction of new technologies by conceiving of them as social experiments.\n'

Abstract: "Stream geomorphology and fluvial processes in Australia have generallybeen modified substantially since European settlement. In the case of theSouthern Tablelands of New South Wales, in southeastern Australia, detailednotes of early explorers and settlers and early survey maps have providedinsight into the nature of these changes. Early explorers described most streamsin this area as 'chains-of-ponds'. These are ponds connected byshort lengths of channel or divided by grassy intervals. Many of these systemswere converted to incised channels after Europeans arrived. An examination ofthe life history characteristics of frogs and their physiological limitationsprovides insight into how these changes are likely to have affected froghabitat. Chains-of-ponds provided permanent breeding ponds for frog species withextended larval stages. The environment surrounding these ponds floodedregularly, providing breeding habitat for species that can exploit ephemeralwaterbodies. Flood waters and saturated soil also created moist, well-vegetatedenvironments for adult frogs during the non-breeding season. Human impacts andlandscape modification led to channel incision of chain-of-pond systems andresulted in many physical changes in pond characteristics, includingavailability, permanency, structural complexity and flow dynamics. Theimplications of these changes are discussed in this paper. Hypotheses aredeveloped on frog species susceptibility to landscape change associated withchannel incision of chain-of-pond systems."

Abstract: 'Due to the strong bitter taste, sacha inchi seeds are usually consumed after roasting, which also contributes to the elimination of antinutrients. Sacha inchi plants fully adapted to cultivation under sub-tropical climate conditions were produced in southeastern Brazil. Our main goal was to evaluate the effect of dry heating (roasting) on the antinutrient content of these seeds. We also investigated the effects of the applied roasting treatments on the antioxidant activity, proximate composition and oxidative stability of the seeds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on antinutrients of sacha inchi seeds cultivated under sub-tropical conditions, outside their native tropical environment. Except for saponins, which are not heat-labile compounds, the contents of all assessed antinutrients continually reduced with the increase in roasting temperature. Roasting improved antioxidant activity and phenolic content in the seeds at the highest temperature. Oxidation changes occurred in the seed oil, and they increased with temperature. However, maximum peroxide value was within the acceptable consumption limits. As a conclusion, roasting treatments can be applied to minimize the antinutrient potential in sacha inchi seeds. Knowledge on the composition and proper processing of sacha inchi cultivated under sub-tropical conditions may support future efforts focused on the development of new production areas.'

Abstract: 'Two new species are described from Mexican amber (15\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0Ma): Cenocephalus tenuis Peris and Sol\xc3\xb3rzano Kraemer sp. nov. and Tesserocerus simojovelensis Peris and Sol\xc3\xb3rzano Kraemer sp. nov. Cenocephalus, originally described as living in Central and South America and then as fossils from Early to Middle Miocene amber, is noted as morphologically indistinguishable from Mitosoma, and originally described as endemic from Madagascar. Thus, we consider that a close taxonomic relationship exists, even if they are not the same genus. New evidence of the species already described in Platypodinae (Tesserocerini) from Mexican and Dominican ambers (15\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0Ma) and the differences between those species are discussed, complementing the original descriptions. The paleobiogeography of Cenocephalus and Mitosoma is analyzed, which strongly supports the hypothesis of colonization from Afrotropical Madagascar to America prior to Early to Middle Miocene (15\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0Ma) via sea currents. Hymenaea was interpreted as the Mexican and Dominican resin producers. Based on the analysis of fossil and current distribution of such plants, our hypothesis considers that the beetle dispersion occurred with Hymenaea, which was possibly its host plant.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we presented the most commonly employed net photosynthetic light-response curves (P N/I curves) fitted by the Solver function of Microsoft Excel. Excel is attractive not only due to its wide availability as a part of the Microsoft Office suite but also due to the increased level of familiarity of undergraduate students with this tool as opposed to other statistical packages. In this study, we explored the use of Excel as a didactic tool which was built upon a previously published paper presenting an Excel Solver tool for calculation of a net photosynthetic/chloroplastic CO2-response curve. Using the Excel spreadsheets accompanying this paper, researchers and students can quickly and easily choose the best fitted P N/I curve, selecting it by the minimal value of the sum of the squares of the errors. We also criticized the misuse of the asymptotic estimate of the maximum gross photosynthetic rate, the light saturation point estimated at a specific percentile of maximum net photosynthetic rate, and the quantum yield at zero photosynthetic photon flux density and we proposed the replacement of these variables by others more directly linked to plant ecophysiology.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents a system of ordinary differential equations in order to explain each one of the sustainable development dimensions (resource, economy and social growth) and their dependance with population growth. Simulations show that system is highly dependant on social and technological parameters, which induce different types of bifurcations. Hopf, saddle-node, homoclinic, codimension-two bifurcation points and chaotic behavior appeared in the system. Non-smooth such as sliding and stable pseudo equilibrium are also present when continuous systems are replaced by Fillipov systems. Analysis conclude that for a sustainable scheme, several sustainability actions must be introduced in the system in order to keep non-trivial equilibrium or stationary oscillations among the dimensions.'

Abstract: 'Root proliferation into the Oa and Oe soil horizons in tropical forests is often substantial and allows direct cycling of nutrients from the organic matter; this was thought to be an adaptation to the low nutrient supply in infertile soils. In this study, we show that experimentally increased litter inputs promote root proliferation into the Oi and Oe horizons in a relatively fertile soil, suggesting that it is a response to a more readily available nutrient source rather than an adaptation to nutrient shortage, and the absence of root mats on fertile tropical soils is simply a consequence of the lack of persistent organic horizons due to high decomposition rates.'

Abstract: 'The ecotone, the spatial transition zone between two vegetation communities, is claimed to have more species than the adjoining communities. However, empirical studies do not always confirm higher richness at the ecotone. The ecotone position and structure are dynamic over time and space and it is driven by the changes in climate, land use or their interaction. In this context, we assessed the forest-grassland ecotone of temperate mountains in central Nepal by i) comparing species composition and richness across the ecotone, ii) analyzing if the forest-grassland ecotone is shifting towards the grassland center by colonizing them with trees, and iii) discussing the consequence of changed disturbance regime in the dynamics of this ecotone and the surrounding grasslands. We analyzed vegetation data sampled from belt transects laid across the forest-grassland ecotone in semi-natural grassland patches. Vegetation data consisting of species richness and composition, and size structure and regeneration of the two most dominant tree species, namely Rhododendron arboreum and Abies spectabilis, from the transects, were used to analyze the trend of the forest-grassland ecotone. Forest and grasslands were different in terms of floristic composition and diversity. Vascular plant species richness linearly increased while moving from forest interior to grassland center. Spatial pattern of tree size structure and regeneration infers that forest boundary is advancing towards the grasslands at the expense of the grassland area, and tree establishment in the grasslands is part of a successional process. Temporally, tree establishment in grasslands started following the gradual decline in disturbance. We argue that local processes in terms of changed land use may best explain the phenomenon of ecotone shift and consequent forest expansion in these grasslands. We underpin the need for further research on the mechanism, rate and spatial extent of ecotone shift by using advanced tools to understand the process indepth.'

Abstract: 'The Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface has changed considerably over the past centuries. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the early 1700s, humans from the \xe2\x80\x9cOld World\xe2\x80\x9d started to colonize the \xe2\x80\x9cNew World\xe2\x80\x9d. The colonization processes lead to major changes in global land use and land cover. Large parts of the original land cover have been altered (e.g., deforestation), leading to extra emissions of GHG\xe2\x80\x99s to the atmosphere and enhancing global climate change. The spatial and temporal aspects are still not very well known. More and more global integrated environmental assessments concerning global sustainability require long time series of global change indicators, of which population is an important one. This study presents an update of the geo-referenced historical population maps for the period 1700\xe2\x80\x932000, part of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE), which can be used in integrated models of global change and/or global sustainability.

Abstract: 'Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) mediate many ecological functions that are important to maintain the ecosystem functioning of terrestrial environments. Although a large amount of literature explores the dung beetle-mediated ecological processes, little is known about the individual contribution from distinct species. Here, we aimed to examine the intra and interspecific variations in dung burial rates performed by two roller dung beetle species (Canthon smaragdulus Fabricius, 1781 and Canthon sulcatus Castelnau, 1840). Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between dung beetle biomass and dung burial rates. We set up a laboratorial experiment with three treatments (two males, two females, and a couple) and 10 replicates per treatment for each dung beetle species, and dung burial rates were measured after exposing 100 g of mixed pig and human excrement for 48 hours. Our results demonstrate that dung burial rates of males, females, and couples within each species do not differ. However, C. smaragdulus individuals performed a larger dung burial than C. sulcatus individuals did. In addition, we found no effect of individual biomass on the amount of dung burial on intra and interspecific levels. These findings highlight the need for further research considering that distinct species, even from the same genus, may perform different rates of ecological processes, as well as about the importance for considering the beetle biomass when measuring their ecological functions. We call for studies to fill in the knowledge gap about the individual species\xe2\x80\x99 contribution to the maintenance of different dung beetle-mediated ecological processes.'

Abstract: 'The WAVES model was used to simulate the effect of global warming on soil moisture on the semi-arid Taihang Mountain in China. Parameters of the WAVES model were first adjusted according to soil moisture data from a field global warming experiment. Then, the reliability of WAVES in predicting soil moisture changes induced by climatic change was confirmed by comparing the simulated and observed soil moisture values under different climatic conditions and plant growth rates of another field treatment. Next, 10 climate change scenarios incorporating increases in temperature and changes in precipitation were designed. When a simulation was conducted using the leaf area index (LAI) growth pattern from a field experiment under the present climatic conditions, the results suggested that the combination of temperature increase and precipitation decrease would greatly decrease soil water content throughout the entire simulation period. On the other hand, only when precipitation increased by 20% and temperatureincreased by 2 \xc2\xb0C, the effect of precipitation increase on soil moisture was obviously positive. Although soil moisture conditions in the T2P1 (temperature increase by 2 \xc2\xb0C and precipitation increase by 10%) and T4P2 (temperature increase by 4 \xc2\xb0C and precipitation increase by 20%) scenarios were slightly better during the rainy season and notmuch changed before the rainy season, the positive effect of 10%precipitation increase on soil moisture was totally offset by moisture decrease caused bya 4 \xc2\xb0C temperature increase in the T4P1 scenario. At the same time, the trends of soil-moisture change were highly coincident with predicted changes in productivity. Finally, the predicted LAI values from other studies were combined with the climatic change scenarios and used in the simulation. The results showed that changes in LAI alleviated, at least to some extent, the effects of temperature and precipitation changes on soil moisture.'

Abstract: 'I document the existence of discontinuities in short- and long-term growth rates of satellite-recorded nighttime lights per capita across national borders, with growth rates of nighttime lights increasing abruptly as one crosses a border from a slower-growing country into a faster-growing one. I show that growth discontinuities are not driven by any special set of borders, or by differences in geographic and climatic conditions on the different sides of borders. I investigate multiple explanations for growth discontinuities, including differences in the determinants of growth across borders and differences in the extent to which borders form barriers to flows of goods, capital or people. I present evidence that differences in the quality of the rule of law are consistently helpful in explaining differences in growth between two countries at their border, and conclude that national-level variables such as institutions and policies may have rapid and important effects on growth.'

Abstract: 'Our main goals were to identify diagnostic characters at the species, genus, and subfamily levels, find anatomical features with potential for future morphological and molecular (combined) phylogenetic analyses, and to reconstruct the evolution of wood anatomical characters in two subfamilies of Primulaceae in a molecular phylogenetic framework. We investigated twenty-seven species from the woody Myrsinoideae (4 genera) and Theophrastoideae (2 genera) using scanning electron, light, and epifluorescence microscopy. Samples were prepared using standard protocols. Based on the wood anatomical characters, we were able to identify synapomorphies and to detect evolutionary trends of interest for the genera and subfamilies. Both subfamilies share the presence of diffuse porosity, simple perforation plates, septate fibres, and scanty paratracheal axial parenchyma. Theophrastoideae species have rays\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x8910 cells wide and short (<\xe2\x80\x89350\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5m) vessel elements, and Myrsinoideae have breakdown areas in rays and longer vessel elements. Ardisia and Stylogyne have scalariform intervessel pits, Myrsine exhibit breakdown areas in rays, and two Cybianthus species from subgenus Weilgetia have distinguishing features (e.g., scalariform perforation plate in C. nemoralis and the absence of rays in C. densiflorus). Overall, when combining characters, we were able to segregate the Neotropical Primulaceae subfamilies and genera from each other and from the subfamily Maesoideae based on wood anatomy.'

Abstract: 'Human perceptions under unstructured forms contain valuable information for ecological restoration (ER). To aid in ER, this paper introduces a working process to analyze the unstructured information for the case study of black bear restoration (BBR) in East Texas where understanding of the perceptions of stakeholders at a community level is needed. We identified the current situation, revealed stakeholders and their interactions, and developed actions for change for BBR. Our techniques included recording discussions in meetings, Soft Systems Methodology, and stakeholder analysis. Results indicated the current situation of BBR with human-bear and human-human conflicts. We figured out that information exchange was interrupted in the public, a potential cause for conflicts. Through a systemization, results showed various roles of key stakeholders and constraints for BBR. We found that local state agencies and local residents (particularly landowners) are the key decision-makers for BBR success. Their collaboration can result in a small portion of success (1/9) that can be increased by more cooperation. The SSM framework introduced in this study can be used for modeling community perceptions in ecological restoration.'

Abstract: 'According to IPCC predictions for 2100, increasing CO2 concentrations and global mean temperature could lead to a future scenario of increased incidence and duration of periods with exceptionally high temperatures and duration of drier seasons in some locations like Central Brazil. This extreme weather can affect fragile environments which are already suffering from anthropogenic disturbance that eventually culminate in biological invasions. One of these environments is the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado), a biome with high levels of endemism, being considered an extremely important area for conservation. The present study aimed to investigate whether elevated CO2 and temperature could modify protoplasmic tolerance to induced water deficit and acute heat shock in three species of invasive African grasses that are gradually replacing the Cerrado landscape. Results obtained from leaf tissues showed that elevated CO2 and temperature had no effect on protoplasmic tolerances of Urochloa brizantha and that Megathyrsus maximus showed decreased thermotolerance. Urochloa decumbens showed improved tolerance responses to both types of these constraints undergone in vitro. Such adaptations to climate changes would probably represent an advantage in competition with other species. The results indicate that elevated CO2 and temperature could cause modifications to protoplasmic responses of invasive grasses. The effects caused, however, depend on the species investigated. This ability to adapt or not to a changing environment may affect species distribution in natural and anthropized environments, especially in a future with predicted extreme weather.'

Abstract: 'Issues of scale and aggregation become important when large range of space and time scales is considered in landscape models. However, identifying appropriate levels of aggregation to accurately represent the processes and components of ecological systems is challenging. A raster-based spatially explicit forest landscape model, LANDIS, was used to study the effects of spatial aggregation on simulated spatial pattern and ecological process in Youhao Forest Bureau of the Small Khingan Mountain in Northeastern China. The model was tested over 500 simulation years with systematically increased levels of spatial aggregation. The results show that spatial aggregation significantly influences the simulation of fire disturbance, species abundance, and spatial pattern. Simulated fire regime was relatively insensitive to grain size between 30.m and 270.m in the region. Spatial aggregation from 300.m to 480.m dramatically decreased fire return interval (FRI) and increased mean fire size. Generally, species abundance and its aggregation index (AI) remained higher level over simulation years at the fine-grained level of spatial aggregation than at coarser grains. In addition, the simulated forest dynamics was more realistic at finer grains. These results suggest that appropriate levels of spatial aggregation for the model should not be larger than 270.m.'

Abstract: 'Saponins are a large group of secondary metabolites occurring in significant amounts in many plant species. However, the saponin content of plants is variable and it can be influenced by the surrounding environment. The local geoclimate, seasonal changes, external conditions such as light, temperature, humidity and soil fertility, as well as cultivation techniques, affect both the quantitative amount and qualitative composition of saponins. Such variation substantially impacts on the quality and properties of wild and cultivated plants exploited for pharmaceutical, nutritional and industrial applications. This review summarizes the available data on the effects of abiotic environmental factors on saponin level in plants, especially those of considerable economic importance, highlighting current problems such as the reduction in natural plant resources, over-exploitation and destruction of wild habitats, climate shifts as well as the consequences of the growing demand for plant-derived medicinal and industrial products. The need for a theoretical basis for a reasonable harvest, attempts at the domestication of wild plant species and the development of new agricultural technologies allowing high production under optimized conditions are also discussed.'

Abstract: 'The greatest diversity of butterflies and their host plants occurs in tropical regions. Some groups of butterflies in the tropics exhibit monophagous feeding in the larval stage, exploiting only one family of plants; others are polyphagous, feeding on plants in two or more distinct families. The two major types of tropical habitats for butterflies, namely primary and secondary forests, offer very different evolutionary opportunities for the exploitation of plants as larval food. Butterflies are faced with the major logistical problem, as are many other herbivorous insects, of depositing eggs on the correct plant for successful larval feeding. This paper, using the concepts of phenotype set and spatial patchiness of resources, attemps to make some predictions as to the optimal phenotypic systems for monophagous and polyphagous feeding in tropical butterflies, as related to the spatial patchiness of larval host plants in primary and secondary forests. In addition to the secondary compound chemistry of larval host plants as playing a role in the evolution of monophagy and polyphagy, the assumption is made that the spatial patchiness of host plants within and among different families also acts as a major factor in determining optimal ranges of phenotypes for different patterns of larval feeding. Owing to the high spatial patchiness of primary forest species of canopy trees and vines, it is predicted that butterflies exploiting these will be mostly polyphagous, whereas secondary forests having stable formations of fewer plant species and larger patches of these plants, will have mostly monophagous species. Forest understories may have both monophagous and polyphagous species, depending upon the layer of forest and the general type of understory (i.e. palmaceous or dicotyledonous). Field data on some groups of butterflies from tropical America support these predictions. Polyphagous butterflies are predicted to possess a genetic system of mixed morphs with a population being polymorphic as a whole; monophagous butterflies are predicted to have individuals all more or less similar genetically, and with a high amount of genic variation within individuals. Other forms of monophagy may evolve in species that are essentially monomorphic but with various mechanisms (physiological, developmental, behavioral) of phenotypic flexibility at the individual level. Although the environment is essentially coarse-grained for larvae since most are sedentary and polymorphism is an optimal adaptive strategy, the oviposition strategy of the adult must also be considered and some situations (i.e. forest canopy) have resources (host plants) distributed in a fine-grained fashion. Other forms of limited polyphagy may result from monomorphic genetic systems in which there is considerable phenotypic flexibility.'

Abstract: 'Total in vitro activity of RuBPCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) enzyme was assayed spectrophotometrically by the continuous measurement of 3-phosphoglycerate-dependent NADH oxidation in a coupled enzyme system.

Moreover, this down-regulation was not caused by a non-specific decrease in total leaf nitrogen content.'

Abstract: 'The present review describes the distribution and biological activities of natural mono-, di-, and triaromatic steroids. It is shown that the producers of aromatic steroids are microorganisms, fungi, and marine invertebrates, and also they were found in plants, animals, marine sediments, and karst deposits. Eighty biologically active aromatic steroids likely have an anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotection activity with a confidence of 78 to 92%. The structures and predicted biological activities of aromatic steroids are available. This review emphasizes the role of aromatic steroids as an important source and potential leads for drug discovery and they are of great interest to chemists, physicians, biologists, pharmacologists, and the pharmaceutical industry.'

Abstract: 'Adverse environmental impacts from deforestation are a growing area of concern in climate change discussions. The Chinese government has implemented a series of policies, such as the Grain for Green Project, in an attempt to mitigate the impacts. This study takes a regional perspective to report land use/land cover changes over the Loess Plateau region from 2001 to 2009. MODIS data were used in analyzing both the conversions among and the resulting changes in different land types. Government statistical census data and observed climate data were also incorporated in the analysis. A general consistency is shown in both remotely sensed and census data. With the implementation of various projects, including the Grain for Green Project, the total areas covered by grassland, cropland, and forests have increased by 19.2\xc2\xa0% (6.05\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89104\xc2\xa0km2), 33.7\xc2\xa0% (5.80\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89104\xc2\xa0km2), and 19.6\xc2\xa0% (3.08\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89104\xc2\xa0km2), respectively, during the 9-year period. While climatic conditions, particularly annual precipitation totals, usually dominate the distribution of vegetation, it is found that socioeconomic polices and human activities contribute to the increase in overall greenness and to vegetation growth (e.g., LAI increased by 16.8\xc2\xa0% (0.10) overall). However, the feedback of land use/land cover to regional climate is complicated and cannot be easily distinguished from natural climate variations based on short-term observational data alone. To better isolate the effects, further analysis and modeling studies are suggested.'

Abstract: 'Few studies of plant\xe2\x80\x93pollinator interactions in fragmented landscapes evaluate the consequences of floral visitor variation on multiple stages of plant reproduction. Given that fragmentation potentially has positive or negative effects on different organisms, and that self-incompatible plant species depend on pollinators for sexual reproduction, differences in floral visitor assemblages may affect certain plant reproductive stages. We evaluated how pollinator assemblage, availability of floral resources, pollination, reproductive output, and seed and seedling performance of Psychotria suterella Muell. Arg. varied among three fragmentation categories: non-fragmented habitats, fragments connected by corridors, and isolated fragments. Richness and frequency of floral visitors were greater in fragments than in non-fragmented sites, resulting mainly from the addition of species typically found in disturbed areas. Although 24 species visited Psychotria suterella flowers, bumblebees were considered the most important pollinators, because they showed the highest frequency of visits and were present in eight out of ten sites. Additionally, the number of pollen tubes per flower per visit was lower in areas without bumblebees. The increased visitation in fragments seemed to enhance pollination slightly. However, fruit and seed output, germination, and seed and seedling mass were similar in non-fragmented sites, connected sites, and isolated fragments. Our results suggested that, even for a self-incompatible species, responses to habitat fragmentation at different stages of plant reproduction might be decoupled from the responses observed in floral visitors, if fruit set is not pollen limited. If all reproductive stages were considered, variation on the small scale was more important than the variation explained by fragmentation category. In spite of its self-incompatible breeding system, this plant\xe2\x80\x93pollinator system showed resilience to habitat fragmentation, mainly as a result of high availability of potential mates to P. suterella individuals, absence of pollen limitation, and the presence of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) throughout this highly connected landscape.'

Abstract: 'This study examined the accumulation of organic carbon (C) and fractions ofsoil phosphorus (P) in soils developing in volcanic ash deposited in the1883 eruption of Krakatau. Organic C has accumulated at rates of 45 to 127g/m2/yr during 110 years of soil development, resulting inprofiles with as much as 14 kgC/m2. Most soil P is found inthe HCl-extractable forms, representing apatite. A loss of HCl-extractableP from the surface horizons is associated with a marked accumulation ofNaOH-extractable organic P bound to Al. A bioassay with hill rice suggeststhat P is limiting to plant growth in these soils, perhaps as a result ofthe rapid accumulation of P in organic forms.'

Abstract: 'Atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise and is predicted to reach approximately 700 ppm by 2100. Some predictions suggest that the dry season in West Africa could be extended with climate change. This study examined the effects of elevated CO2 concentration and water deficit on growth and photosynthesis of juvenile cacao. Light-saturated photosynthesis (Pmax), quantum efficiency, and intrinsic water-use efficiency increased significantly in response to elevated CO2, as did a range of growth and development responses (e.g. leaf area and leaf number), but the magnitude of the increase was dependent on the water treatment. Stomatal index was significantly greater in the elevated CO2 treatment; an atypical response which may be a reflection of the environment in which cacao evolved. This study shows a positive effect of elevated CO2 on juvenile cacao which may help to alleviate some of the negative impacts of water deficit stress.'

Abstract: ' Raoiella indica Hirst (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) is considered a pest of coconut palm in Asia and the Middle East. This mite was recently introduced in the Americas, where it spread to several countries and expanded its range of hosts, causing heavy losses to coconut and banana production. The phytoseiid mite Amblyseius largoensis (Muma) is one of the predators most often encountered in coconut palms. Because the current prospects for the control of R. indica in the New World indicate the use of acaricides and the management of their natural enemies, the objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of selected acaricides to R. indica and the selectivity (i.e., toxicity to the predator relative to toxicity to the prey) for A. largoensis. Assays were performed by the immersion of banana leaf discs in acaricide solutions, followed by the placing of adult females of the pest or predator on the discs. Mortality of the mites was evaluated after 24\xc2\xa0h, and the data obtained were subjected to probit analysis. Abamectin, fenpyroximate, milbemectin and spirodiclofen were the products most toxic to R. indica adults, whereas fenpyroximate and spirodiclofen were the most selective for A. largoensis.'

Abstract: 'Alborz Mountains host Caspian Hyrcanian forest ecoregion along the northern slopes and forest steppe ecoregion in highlands. Hyrcanian forest covers the southeastern part of Caucasus biodiversity hotspot and is of great biogeographic importance. Altitudinal pattern and correlation between woody species biodiversity (DIV), forest structure ((stem density (DEN), mean basal area (MBA) and mean height class (MHC)) and disturbance (DIS) were explored along 2,400 m altitudinal gradient in Hyrcanian relict forest, Central Alborz Mountains. Vegetation changes from lowland forest (LoF) to midaltitude forest (MiF) and montane forest (MoF) in this area. The altitudinal gradient was divided into twelve 200 m elevational belts. Point centered quarter method (PCQM) with 96 sampling points and 83 vegetation samples by plot method (PM) were used to record field data. Shannon-Wiener index and Pearson coefficient were used for diversity and correlation analysis. The results showed that DEN decreased linearly, MBA and MHC showed relatively hump shaped and DIS showed a reverse hump shaped pattern of change along altitudinal gradient. Woody species diversity decreased non-steadily from LoF to MoF. Transitional vegetations of Carpinus-Fagus and Fagus-Quercus represented higher diversity of woody taxa compared to adjacent homogenous communities. Significant correlation was observed between altitude and all parameters: DEN with MBA, DIS and DIV; MBA with DIS; MHC with DIS along with DIV; and DIS with DIV at the study area scale. Surprisingly, correlation between studied parameters differed within each vegetation type. Altitude probably acts as a proxy for human and environmental driving forces in this area. Stability of warm and wet condition, season length, soil depth along with forest accessibility probably influences the altitudinal pattern of the studied parameters. Disturbance affects forest structure and consequently diversity; especially in lowlands. The obtained results recommend using both forest biodiversity and mensuration data in management process of forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'The effects of pretreatment of 0\xe2\x80\x935\xc2\xa0mM salicylic acid (SA) on the sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) seedlings during chilling stress were investigated. The stress induced damage to seedlings, and SA pretreatment decreased the level of damage. Lipid peroxidation, measured in terms of malondialdehyde content, increased significantly by stress, and SA pretreatment prevented the increase because SA decreased the production rate of superoxide anion (O 2 \xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\x95 ) and H2O2 content. SA pretreatment increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase and decreased activity of dehydroascorbate reductase. In addition, SA pretreatment increased the content of proline and soluble sugar. Results suggested that the pretreatment of sacha inchi seedlings with SA may induce antioxidant enzymes which lead to increased chilling tolerance. The best protection appeared to be obtained from seedlings that were sprayed with SA at 0.5 and 1\xc2\xa0mM. Induction of chilling tolerance in seedlings by exogenous application of SA may have a significant practical application in sacha inchi plantation.'

Abstract: 'Among the tasks of modern political philosophy is to develop a favored conception of the relations among modern citizens, among people who can know little or nothing of one another individually and yet are deeply reciprocally dependent. One might think of this as developing a favored conception of civic friendship. In this essay I sketch two candidate conceptions. The first derives from the Kantian tradition, the second from the 1844 Marx. I present the two conceptions and then describe similarities and differences. My approach is both taxonomic and programmatic. My taxonomic goal is to provide an initial sketch of the conceptual territory. My programmatic goal is to provide reasons to think that the conception derived from Marx is both appealing and feasible.'

Abstract: "The occurrence of disturbed sectors may be as important as microscaleedge effects in tropical forests fragments. We considered the spatialdistribution dynamics of life stages (youngs, immatures, and adults) of theacaulescent, endemic palm Attalea humilis Mart. ex.Spreng.in fire-prone fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic forest to investigatepopulation responses to fragment size and fire occurrence. From 1996 to 1999,werecorded the number of individuals in different life stages in adjacent10\xc3\x9710-m plots in two perpendicular transects across each of threefragments of different sizes (1.6, 6.4, and 9.9 ha) in the ReservaNacional de Po\xc3\xa7o das Antas, Southeastern Brazil. A fire burnt thefragments studied in 1997. Application of Morisita's Index showed clumping atmost scales, with a marked reduction in clumping degree from youngs to adults,apattern not influenced by fragment size. After fire, clumping degree increasedtemporarily among the youngs. No association between life stages was detectedusing presence/absence data. Palm density concentrated in the most disturbedtransect arms, a pattern very little affected by fragment size or fire. Noconsistent relationship between palm density and distance from fragment edgewasdetected for any stage, fragment, or year. We hypothesize that short-distanceseed dispersal by scatterhoarding rodents results in discrete, low-densityclumps of youngs dissociated from reproductive plants. The spatial pattern oflater stages is probably conditioned by the distribution of canopy gaps in thelargest, more closed fragment. In the other fragments, the presence of largedisturbed sectors promotes the formation of large, continuous stands of palms.This pattern would be reinforced by fire, which is known to be recurrent onalready disturbed sites. For the species studied, large-scale variations in theforest structure (degraded vs. preserved fragment sectors) seems to be moreimportant than microscale edge effects."

Abstract: 'Passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) is an exotic climbing vine. Originating in South America, passion fruit is now grown worldwide as an edible fruit for the food industry. It has been used widely in folk medicine in South America to treat anxiety, insomnia, asthma, bronchitis and urinary infection. The constituents of different extracts include flavonoids, alkaloids, cyanogenic compounds, glycosides, vitamins, minerals and terpenoid compounds. The in vitro inhibitory effect of fruit aqueous extract on matrix-metalloprotease 2 and 9 has been shown. While some animal studies have described anxiolytic effect of leaf extract, one provided contradictory evidence. However, objective scientific validation of the putative health benefits of P. edulis in humans is still lacking. Although short-term adverse effects of crude leaf extract in human have been described, there is not any large-scale case-control study. This situation has led to questionable conclusions concerning specific health benefits or risks of P. edulis. Further studies are warranted to explore the efficacy and safety of P. edulis extracts.'

Abstract: 'Global change will lead to increases in regional precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition in the semi-arid grasslands of northern China. We investigated the responses of vegetation carbon (C) pools to simulated precipitation and N deposition increases through field experiments in a typical steppe in Inner Mongolia. The treatments included NH4NO3 addition at concentrations of 0 (CK), 5 (LN, low nitrogen), 10 (middle nitrogen, MN), and 20 (HN, high nitrogen) (g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0a\xe2\x88\x921) with and without water. After three consecutive years of treatment, from 2010 to 2012, water addition did not significantly change the size of the total vegetation C pools, but it significantly decreased the ratio of root:shoot (R:S) (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.05) relative to controls. By contrast, N addition significantly increased the total vegetation C pools. The C pools in the LN, MN and HN treatments increased by 22, 39 and 44\xc2\xa0%, respectively. MN produced the largest effect among the N concentrations, although differences between N-added treatments were not significant (P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05). N addition significantly reduced the ratio of root:shoot (R:S) (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.03). However, there were no significant interactive effects of water and N addition on the vegetation C pools.'

Abstract: 'The roots and shoots of vascular plants may be positionally and developmentally related in various ways. However, botanical teaching and research are strongly influenced by the paradigmatic annual dicotyledon, whose bipolar embryo develops into a plant with root and shoot meeting only at the hypocotyl. In 1930 Goebel criticized this example as a general model for plants, proposing instead the opposed concepts \xe2\x80\x9callorhizy\xe2\x80\x9d (referring to plants whose root and shoot are related as above) and \xe2\x80\x9chomorhizy\xe2\x80\x9d(referring to plants without a bipolar embryo, all of whose roots are shoot-borne, e.g., pteridophytes). Goebel\xe2\x80\x99s approach permeates the extensive German morphological literature, but has been virtually ignored in English-language literature. The allorhizy/homorhizy dichotomy has proved heuristic. However, it suggests a correlation between embryo type and mature morphology that does not always hold. Furthermore, it does not take into account the root-borne shoots typical of many plant species. Finally, Goebel\xe2\x80\x99s presentation of the terms (which he does not explicitly define) creates ambiguity as to whether they designate structural concepts or the attributes of evolutionary groups. The alternative proposed here is a structural analysis of the possible topological relationships among root and shoot systems. Each structural class is then considered with regard to embryo types, potential for clonal growth and other ecological correlates, and phylogenetic distribution. This approach provides both a test of Goebel\xe2\x80\x99s concepts and a basis for further comparative study of wholeplant form.'

Abstract: 'While tourism is often seen as a welcome source of economic development, conventional mass tourism is associated with numerous negative effects, such as the destruction of ecological systems and loss of cultural heritage. In response to these concerns, a term that has surfaced recently is, sustainable tourism. This article attempts to define sustainable tourism and asks the question of whether this new term is an acceptable criteria or is merely a marketing ploy to attract the morally conscious tourist.'

Abstract: 'Multistability or coexistence of different chaotic attractors for a given set of parameters depending on the initial condition only is one of the most exciting phenomenon in dynamical systems. The schemes to design multistability systems via coupling two identical or non-identical but the same-dimensional systems have been proposed earlier. Coupled different-dimensional systems are very useful to describe the real-world physical and biological systems. In this paper, a scheme for designing a multistable system by coupling two different-dimensional dynamical systems has been proposed. Coupled Lorenz and Lorenz\xe2\x80\x93Stenflo systems have been considered to illustrate the scheme. The efficiency of the scheme is shown numerically, by presenting phase diagrams, bifurcation diagrams and variation of maximum Lyapunov exponents.'

Abstract: 'This study examines the radial trend in wood stiffness of tropical rainforest trees. The objective was to determine if the type of growing environment (exposed plantation or dense primary forest) would have an effect on this radial trend.'

Abstract: 'Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers (BTEX) are volatile organic air pollutants of concern which arise from natural and anthropogenic sources. This study aims to determine and evaluate the BTEX levels in ambient air in selected areas of Malaysia, namely: Kuala Lumpur (KL-urban), Penang (PG-urban), Bangi (BG-suburban), Langkawi (LGK-suburban) and the Danum Valley (DV-rural). Active sampling with sorbent tubes was applied in this study and samples were analysed using thermal desorption (TD) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results show that the urban area of KL had the highest \xce\xa3BTEX (40.36\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x896.99\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3) followed by PG (30.82\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x898.06\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3). \xce\xa3BTEX concentrations in the suburban areas of LGK and BG were measured as 20.22\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8911.42\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3 and 12.36\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.26\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3, respectively. The rural area of DV had the lowest concentration of \xce\xa3BTEX (5.55\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.54\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3). The average toluene to benzene (T:B) ratio at KL, PG and LG were found to be within the range of 2.00\xe2\x80\x935.00 thus indicating vehicle emissions as the main source. The benzene level at both KL (7.43\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3) and PG (5.12\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3) were found to be slightly higher than the annual benchmark of 5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/m3 as suggested by the European Union (EU). The results of health risk assessments found that the cancer risk (CR) based on benzene concentrations in urban, suburban and rural areas was >\xe2\x80\x8910\xe2\x88\x926 thus indicating a link between human cancer risks and ambient benzene exposure.'

Abstract: 'Asian common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) is a polycarpic perennial plant with a mixed inbreeder/outbreeder strategy. Seeds and clones are both reproductive components of the population. However, when collected in the flowering stage, the two differ substantially as to whether they have experienced natural selection directly or not. This study is aimed at evaluating mechanisms for the survival of a population by comparing genetic structure among subpopulations that are classified in terms of: (1) reproductive systems (clones or seeds); and also (2) location (fringe or inside). First, the genotypes determined at seven SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) loci showed that parameters of observed heterozygosity (HO) and outcrossing rate (t) were clearly higher in clones (HO = 0.609, t = 82.4%) than in seeds (HO = 0.346, t = 35.5%), although the two had approximately the same values for the number of alleles (A) and expected heterozygosity (HE)(A = 4.43 in both clones and seeds, HE = 0.709, 0.692 in clones and seeds, respectively). This result indicates that the individuals showing \xe2\x80\x99heterosis\xe2\x80\x99, with high numbers of heterozygous loci and outcrossing rates, are more likely to survive in the natural habitat. Secondly, parameters of observed heterozygosity and outcrossing rates were lower for seeds from the fringe area (HO = 0.238, t = 24.6%) compared to seeds from the inside area (HO = 0.443, t = 60.7%), although values were similar in clones of both the fringe and inside areas. This result suggests that the \xe2\x80\x99edge effect\xe2\x80\x99 might be due mainly to the restriction of wind strength in fringe area of the forested swamp.'

Abstract: 'Assessment of the future of biodiversity under climate change has been based on climate-only models. We investigated the effects of including soil information when predicting future suitable areas for selected plant species in Amazonia.'

Abstract: 'The economics of climate change is characterized by many uncertainties regarding, for instance, climate dynamics, economic damages and potentially irreversible climate catastrophes. Using an optimal growth model of a fossil-fuel-driven economy subject to climate externalities and potentially irreversible climatic regime shifts, this paper contributes to the understanding of how the risk of such events impacts on optimal fossil-fuel use, carbon taxes and fossil-fuel prices over time. We show that in excess, to an increase in the expected present value of marginal damages and an increase in the probability of triggering the event, there also exists a third opposing effect. This effect comes from the fall in value of remaining fossil-fuel reserve, which results from the potential regime shift which may (or may not) occur sometime in the future, and implies that optimal fossil-fuel policy shifts towards using more resources early on. This effect is related to the idea of the green paradox. We prove the existence of this effect and show under which circumstances it can become quantitatively important. Numerically, the green-paradox effect seems to be somewhat smaller than, but comparable in size to, the increase in expected marginal damages. In general, our findings highlight the importance of considering the supply-side impacts on climate policy in response to catastrophic climate events.'

Abstract: 'Chile needs to diversify its energy supply, and should establish policies that encourage the production and use of biofuels. The demand for energy resources increases with population growth and industrial development, making it urgent to find green alternatives to minimize the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of traditional fuels. However, it is required that sophisticated strategies consider all externalities from the production of biofuels and should be established on the basis of protecting the environment, reducing GHG emissions and to avoid violating human rights. This article presents the Chilean reality, based on ethical principles that should be guarded to regulate the bioenergy market. These principles are: (1) human rights, (2) environmental sustainability, (3) climate change mitigation, (4) right to a fair reward, and (5) equitable distribution. It is concluded that in Chile the concentration of land and water for the development of extractive industries; and for agricultural and forestry purposes, contradicts the principle of human rights. The unequal distribution of income is also highlighted as part of a cycle of social injustice, with a high Gini coefficient (0.52). However, the policy of biofuels can be strengthened with the early use of second generation feedstock, the introduction of fair trade and regulation by the state to encourage participation of small farmers, and allows a position for Chile at the forefront of bioenergy production.'

Abstract: 'Fire regime is affected by climate and human settlements. In the Mediterranean, the predicted climate change is likely to exacerbate fire prone weather conditions, but the mid- to long-term impact of climate change on fire regime is not easily predictable. A negative feedback via fuel reduction, for instance, might cause a non-linear response of burned area to fire weather. Also, the number of fires escaping initial control could grow dramatically if the fire meteorology is just slightly more severe than what fire brigades are prepared for. Humans can directly influence fire regimes through ignition frequency, fire suppression and land use management. Here we use the fire regime model FIRE LADY to assess the impacts of climate change and local management options on number of fires, burned area, fraction of area burned in large fires and forest area during the twenty-first century in three regions of NE Spain. Our results show that currently fuel-humidity limited regions could suffer a drastic shift of fire regime with an up to 8 fold increase of annual burned area, due to a combination of fuel accumulation and severe fire weather, which would result in a period of unusually large fires. The impact of climate change on fire regime is predicted to be less pronounced in drier areas, with a gradual increase of burned area. Local fire prevention strategies could reduce but not totally offset climate induced changes in fire regimes. According to our model, a combination of restoring the traditional rural mosaic and classical fire prevention would be the most effective strategy, as a lower ignition frequency reduces the number of fires and the creation of agricultural fields in marginal areas reduces their extent.'

Abstract: 'This paper deals with the process of Shintoism transplantation in Brazil and its related strategies of dissemination. Shint\xc5\x8d in Brazil is divided in two diffusion stages representing at the same time two main poles in the transplantation process. The first phase is defined by State Shint\xc5\x8d that remained the main worldview of Japanese immigrants in Brazil until the 1950s, initially uniting and later separating the ethnic community on issues such as emperor devotion and Japanese spirit loyalty. The transmission of the nationalistic belief was largely maintained by the provisionary Japanese schools and the Emperor cult recreated in Brazil. The second pole developed as a Japanese Brazilian (Nikkei) Shint\xc5\x8d and is marked by the new Shintoist groups blended with the Spiritist worldview. These shrines were created in Brazil by the immigrants themselves, and some still preserve a combination of ancestor worship, Japanese folk religion, and incorporated local deities. At the end of the paper, I will review the current challenges of Shint\xc5\x8d in Brazil as it relates to collective memory maintenance and connection with the local nature if the social survival of Shint\xc5\x8d in Brazil is to be pursued.'

Abstract: 'Any discipline of human knowledge is characterized by three fundamental elements: the complexity of its content, the method used for its elaboration, and the language used for its expression. This article argues that any method for making knowledge is a particular combination of three main components that we can call (a) science, (b) art, and (c) revelation. The right combination depends on the complexity of the slice of reality that we wish to understand in each case. Is there a relationship between the quantity and quality of a particular piece of knowledge and the quantity and quality of its eventual audience? Such a relationship serves, I believe, to avoid certain old misunderstandings.'

Abstract: "Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which states the treaty's long-term objective, is the subject of a growing literature that examines means to interpret and implement this provision. Here we provide context for these studies by exploring the intertwined scientific, legal, economic, and political history of Article 2. We review proposed definitions for \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous anthropogenic interference\xe2\x80\x9d and frameworks that have been proposed for implementing these definitions. Specific examples of dangerous climate changes suggest limits on global warming ranging from 1 to 4 \xe2\x88\x98C and on concentrations ranging from 450 to 700 ppm CO2 equivalents. The implications of Article 2 for near term restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions, e.g., the Kyoto Protocol, are also discussed."

Abstract: 'In order to examine the seasonal characteristics of the dust events over western parts of Iran, surface observations from 27 meteorological stations for the period 1951\xe2\x80\x932014 were analyzed to obtain spatial distributions and temporal variations and trend of dusty day frequency (DDF). Trends of DDF were analyzed by Mann\xe2\x80\x93Kendall and Sen\xe2\x80\x99s estimator of slope nonparametric statistics. Three meteorological stations were selected in north (Tabriz), middle (Kermanshah), and south of the study area (Ahwaz) as reference stations for detecting the regional differences of DDFs. The results showed that DDF is a variable season by season but in general, DDF increases from north to south and from east to west of Iran. The maximum of DDF is monitored in May, June, and July. There are tangible seasonal increasing\xe2\x80\x93decreasing periods in which these changes are logically related with seasonal changes. Regardless of the existence of the maximum DDF in south and southwest of study area, the most intensive increasing DDF trend is calculated in west middle areas. The most widespread and intensive increasing DDF pattern in west of Iran is observed when it is spring. In this case, the dust storms replaced the rainfalls. Distance from dust sources, major movement ways of dust transporting synoptic systems, regional effective wind activity (such as Shamal wind), and arrangement of high mountains are the known factors affecting frequency variation, distribution, and rate of the trend of all the dust phenomena in west of Iran.'

Abstract: 'The use of glycerol obtained as an intermediate of the biodiesel manufacturing process as carbon source for microbial growth is a potential alternative strategy for the production of enzymes and other high-value bioproducts. This work evaluates the production of cellulase enzymes using glycerol for high cell density growth of Trichoderma harzianum followed by induction with a cellulosic material. Firstly, the influence of the carbon source used in the pre-culture step was investigated in terms of total protein secretion and fungal morphology. Enzymatic productivity was then determined for cultivation strategies using different types and concentrations of carbon source, as well as different feeding procedures (batch and fed-batch). The best strategy for cellulase production was then further studied on a larger scale using a stirred tank bioreactor. The proposed strategy for cellulase production, using glycerol to achieve high cell density growth followed by induction with pretreated sugarcane bagasse, achieved enzymatic activities up to 2.27\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.37\xc2\xa0FPU/mL, 106.40\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08.87\xc2\xa0IU/mL, and 9.04\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.39\xc2\xa0IU/mL of cellulase, xylanase, and \xce\xb2-glucosidase, respectively. These values were 2 times higher when compared to the control experiments using glucose instead of glycerol. This novel strategy proved to be a promising approach for improving cellulolytic enzymes production, and could potentially contribute to adding value to biomass within the biofuels sector.'

Abstract: 'We report biological data of two generations of Amblyomma triste in laboratory and compared the suitability of different host species. Infestations by larval and nymphal stages were performed on guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), chickens (Gallus gallus), rats (Rattus norvegicus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), wild mice (Calomys callosus), dogs (Canis familiaris) and capybaras (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris). Infestations by adult ticks were performed on dogs, capybaras and rabbits. Tick developmental periods were observed in an incubator at 27 \xc2\xb0C and RH 90%. Guinea pigs were the most suitable hosts for larvae and nymphs, followed by chickens. The remaining host species were less suitable for immature ticks as fewer engorged ticks were recovered from them. Mean larval feeding periods varied from 3.8 to 4.7 d between different host species. Mean larval premolt periods ranged from 8.9 to 10.4 d. Nymphal mean feeding periods varied from 4.2 to 6.2 d for ticks fed on different host species. Premolt period of male nymphs (mean: 15.4 d) was significantly longer than that of female nymphs (14.7 d). Female nymphs were significantly heavier than male nymphs. The overall sex ratio of the adult ticks emerged from nymphs was 0.9:1 (M:F). Capybaras were the most suitable host for the tick adult stage as significantly more engorged females were recovered from them and these females were significantly heavier than those recovered from dogs or rabbits. The life cycle of A. triste in laboratory could be completed in an average period of 155 d. The potential role of guinea pigs, birds and capybaras, as hosts for A. triste in nature, is discussed.'

Abstract: 'Today, the environment and addressing various aspects of its conservation and protection, whether in the national aspect or in the international dimensions, are one of the important issues of each society. Although in the past decades the international community attempted to prevent environmental damage by ratifying international instruments and encouraging states to pass civil and criminal law in their national law, up to the present time none of them has solved any of the current problems. Therefore, the need for environmental criminalization at the international level is seriously felt. However, there are challenges which have made the process of environmental criminalization happen at a lower speed. The present study defines environmental crime and its different kinds and discusses the inefficiency of the present international instruments in prevention and reduction of environmental damage, and it finally identifies and introduces the challenges in the way of indices codification of environmental criminalization as an international crime and tries to explain reasons for the failure of the international community to introduce environmental crime as the fifth international crime.'

Abstract: 'The importance of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to rural income was examined in a highland community in the Sierra de Manantl\xc3\xa1n Biosphere Reserve, Jalisco-Colima, Mexico. Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) techniques were used to interview 70% of households in the community of El Terrero. Of the nine plant species identified as NTFP sources, the two principal species traded by the community were tila (derived from the flowers and fruits of the tree Ternstroemia lineata), and blackberry (Rubus spp.). Collecting and selling of NTFPs was almost exclusively undertaken by women, with 80% of respondents participating. NTFP sale ranked as the most important source of cash income for 30% of women interviewed, and either second- or third-most important for the remainder. The research examined harvesting impact on populations of T. lineata, an understory tree species characteristic of cloud forest, which this was assessed in the four most-frequented collecting sites. Our results suggested that current harvesting approaches appear to be sustainable, although 95% of the women interviewed reported a decline in resource availability within the last 15 years, apparently resulting from illegal cutting. Suggestions are made with respect to the sustainable development of NTFP resources to help alleviate poverty within the Reserve.'

Abstract: 'Lianas play a key role in forest structure, species diversity, as well as functional aspects of tropical forests. Although the study of lianas in the tropics has increased dramatically in recent years, basic information on liana communities for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest is still scarce. To understand general patterns of liana abundance and biomass along an elevational gradient (0\xe2\x80\x931,100\xc2\xa0m asl) of coastal Atlantic Forest, we carried out a standard census for lianas \xe2\x89\xa51\xc2\xa0cm in five 1-ha plots distributed across different forest sites. On average, we found a twofold variation in liana abundance and biomass between lowland and other forest types. Large lianas (\xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm) accounted for 26\xe2\x80\x9335% of total liana biomass at lower elevations, but they were not recorded in montane forests. Although the abundance of lianas displayed strong spatial structure at short distances, the present local forest structure played a minor role structuring liana communities at the scale of 0.01\xc2\xa0ha. Compared to similar moist and wet Neotropical forests, lianas are slightly less abundant in the Atlantic Forest, but the total biomass is similar. Our study highlights two important points: (1) despite some studies have shown the importance of small-scale canopy disturbance and support availability, the spatial scale of the relationships between lianas and forest structure can vary greatly among tropical forests; (2) our results add to the evidence that past canopy disturbance levels and minimum temperature variation exert influence on the structure of liana communities in tropical moist forests, particularly along short and steep elevational gradients.'

Abstract: 'Through the systematic investigation of nitrogen isotope composition (\xce\xb4 15N) in modern plants in Dongling Mountain in Beijing, the characteristics of \xce\xb4 15N in plants, the differences of \xce\xb4 15N among plants with different functional types, and the altitudinal trends of plant \xce\xb4 15N values revealed the environmental effects on \xce\xb4 15N. Our results are: (1) the values of \xce\xb4 15N of plants in Dongling Mountain range between \xe2\x88\x928.0\xe2\x80\xb0 and 14.0\xe2\x80\xb0, with an average value of \xe2\x88\x921.03\xe2\x80\xb0; (2) \xce\xb4 15N values are variant among different plant functional types. Generally, the \xce\xb4 15N of shrubs are smaller than that of trees, and larger than that of herbaceous plants. The main reason may be the selective absorption of variant nitrogen resource with different \xce\xb4 15N values in soil; (3) there is a second-order polynomials relationship between the altitudes and the average \xce\xb4 15N values of plants, which shows a negative and positive correlation below and above 1350 m a.s.l., respectively. This indicates that the precipitation is a main controlling factor of plant 15N fractionation for the former, and the temperature for the latter; (4) three different, i.e., positive, negative, and no significant, correlations are performed between \xce\xb4 15N of individual species and altitudes. This may be related to different inherited characteristics and the process of nitrogen metabolize; and (5) variant altitudinal trends of plant \xce\xb4 15N are associated with different 15N composition of soil at different altitude, for which the key influencing factors are the changing temperature and precipitation with altitude rather than nitrogen content in leaf.'

Abstract: 'Climate is one of many factors to be considered in adapting systems to environmental and societal change and often it is not the most important factor. Moreover, given considerable model inadequacies, irreducible uncertainties, and poor accessibility to model output, we may legitimately ask whether or not regional climate projections ought to have a central role in guiding climate change adaptation decisions. This question is addressed by analysing the value of regional downscaled climate model output in the management of complex socio-ecological systems (SESs) vulnerable to climate change. We demonstrate, using the example of the Dwesa\xe2\x80\x93Cwebe region in South Africa, that the management of such systems under changing environmental and socio-economic conditions requires a nuanced and holistic approach that addresses cross-scale system interdependencies and incorporates \xe2\x80\x9ccomplexity thinking\xe2\x80\x9d. We argue that the persistent focus on increasing precision and skill in regional climate projections is misguided and does not adequately address the needs of society. However, this does not imply that decision makers should exclude current and future generations of regional climate projections in their management processes. On the contrary, ignoring such information, however uncertain and incomplete, risks the implementation of maladaptive policies and practices. By using regional climate projections to further explore uncertainties and investigate cross-scale system dependencies, such information can be used to aid understanding of how SESs might evolve under alternative future societal and environmental scenarios.'

Abstract: 'Different solid state fermentation (SSF) sources were tested such as cantaloupe and watermelon rinds, orange and banana peels, for the production of polygalacturonase (PG) and xylanase (Xyl) by Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma virens. The maximum production of both PG and Xyl were obtained by T. harzianum and T. virnes grown on cantaloupe and watermelon rinds, respectively. Time course, moisture content, temperature, pH, supplementation with carbon and nitrogen sources were optimized to achieve the maximum production of both PG and Xyl of T. harzianum and T. virens using cantaloupe and watermelon rinds, respectively. The maximum production of PG and Xyl of T. harzianum and T. virens was recorded at 4\xe2\x80\x935 days of incubation, 50\xe2\x80\x9366% moisture, temperature 28\xe2\x80\x9335\xc2\xb0C and pH 6\xe2\x80\x937. The influence of supplementary carbon and nitrogen sources was studied. For T. harzianum, lactose enhanced PG activity from 87 to 120 units/g solid, where starch and maltose enhanced Xyl activity from 40 to 55\xe2\x80\x9360 units/g solid for T. virnes. Among the nitrogen sources, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, yeast extract and urea increased PG activity from 90 to 110\xe2\x80\x93113 units/g solid for T. harzianum. Similarly, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulphate and yeast extract increased Xyl activity from 45 to 55\xe2\x80\x9370 units/g solid for T. virens.'

Abstract: 'Despite being a seemingly straightforward moral concept (that all humans have certain rights by virtue of their humanity), human rights is a contested concept in theory and practice. Theorists debate (among other things) the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9crights,\xe2\x80\x9d the priority of rights, whether collective rights are universal, the foundations of rights, and whether there are universal human rights at all. These debates are of relatively greater interest to theorists; however, a given meaning of \xe2\x80\x9chuman rights\xe2\x80\x9d implies a corresponding theory of change and through that can be an important guide to the practice of human rights activists and their funders. In practice, any organization can describe their work as \xe2\x80\x9crights based.\xe2\x80\x9d This article clarifies the practices of human rights activists and their funders that are consistent with a theory of human rights as (1) universal, (2) interdependent across groups and categories of people, (3) indivisible across issue areas and claims, and (4) measured by the enjoyment of rights.'

Abstract: 'An apparent contradiction in the ecology of cycad plants is that their seeds are known to be highly poisonous, and yet they seem well adapted for seed dispersal by animals, as shown by their visually conspicuous seed cones and large seeds presented within a brightly colored fleshy \xe2\x80\x9cfruit\xe2\x80\x9d of sarcotesta. We tested if this sarcotesta could function as a reward for cycad seed dispersal fauna, by establishing if the toxic compound cycasin, known from the seeds, is absent from the sarcotesta. The Australian cycads Macrozamia miquelii and Cycas ophiolitica were tested (N\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8910 individuals per species) using gas chromatography / mass spectrometry. Cycasin was detected at 0.34\xc2\xa0% (fresh weight) in seed endosperm of M. miquelii and 0.28\xc2\xa0% (fresh weight) in seed endosperm of C. ophiolitica. Cycasin was absent from the sarcotesta of the same propagules (none detected in the case of M. miquelii, and trace quantities detected in sarcotesta of only four of the ten C. ophiolitica propagules). This laboratory finding was supported by field observations of native animals eating the sarcotesta of these cycads but discarding the toxic seed intact. These results suggest cycads are adapted for dispersal fauna capable of swallowing the large, heavy propagules whole, digesting the non-toxic sarcotesta flesh internally, and then voiding the toxic seed intact. Megafauna species such as extant emus or cassowaries, or extinct Pleistocene megafauna such as Genyornis, are plausible candidates for such dispersal. Cycads are an ancient lineage, and the possible antiquity of their megafaunal seed dispersal adaptations are discussed.'

Abstract: "This study was performed to assess how local inhabitants in two tropical watersheds value forests and perceive both forests and their own capacity to influence the hydrological cycle. Both service and productivity functions were strongly valued, particularly forests' rain-bringing capacity. The view that forests are directly responsible for increased precipitation was especially strong in low rainfall areas. Forests were also seen as important for their ability to retain soil water. The human activity most often mentioned as affecting water availability was tree planting while water conservation structures were not seen as detrimentally affecting others. Water was pictured very strongly as being part of a cycle so that which is used by humans or trees is not considered lost but only displaced to return again as rain."

Abstract: 'Fifteen years after a symposium on economic plants projecting to the year 2000, what predictions and remarks of the speakers with reference to ethnobotany and medicinal plants proved prophetic and what others fell short? Certainly they predicted a continuation of acculturation, biodiversity loss, and technology advances. They also foresaw the need for collaborative, multidisciplinary research and major government funding, and changes in regulations governing an expanded industry in botanicals, nutriceuticals, and phytopharmaceuticals, all of which occurred. However, many technologies were in their infancy or unknown, such as gene amplification and recombinant procedures, high-throughput screening, gene chip technology, and combinatorial chemistry, and are only now being used in research and development in the discovery of new therapeutics. Likewise, who would have foreseen worldwide devastating effects of mutant microorganisms resistant to drugs of choice for treating important diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis? Research data involving these two infections illustrate the value of finding activity based on collections specifically targeted by indigenous users (antimalaria) and those generally used medicinally together with chemotaxonomic selections (antituberculosis). A discussion of research beyond 2000 addresses the future of ethnobotanical research, acculturation and biodiversity losses, collaborative research, regulation and/or standardization of Pharmaceuticals, nutriceuticals, and phytopharmaceuticals, and new technologies.'

Abstract: 'A wide range of actions imperil the planet and threaten the future of humanity and other species. This essay notes some examples of crimes and harms damaging to the environment and human and non-human species as well as various forms of response that have called for more effective and appropriate models of justice and law than currently prevail. This leads to a discussion of several suggestions regarding the development and expression of an earth jurisprudence and to the history of a proposal that \xe2\x80\x9cecocide\xe2\x80\x9d be recognised internationally as a crime. Analysis of documentary sources traces this idea from debates about the concept of genocide to consideration by United Nations officials as to how crimes against the environment might be defined, and shows how near such a proposal has previously come to acceptance and enactment. The article concludes with an argument for supporting a law of ecocide as the 5th Crime against Peace.'

Abstract: 'Climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration are intimately coupled in the Earth system: CO2 influences climate through the greenhouse effect, but climate also affects CO2 through its impact on the amount of carbon stored on land and in the ocean. The change in atmospheric CO2 as a response to a change in temperature (\\(\\varDelta CO_{2}/\\varDelta T\\)) is a useful measure to quantify the feedback between the carbon cycle and climate. Using an ensemble of experiments with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity we show a pronounced time-scale dependence of \\(\\varDelta CO_{2}/\\varDelta T\\). A maximum is found on centennial scales with \\(\\varDelta CO_{2}/\\varDelta T\\) values for the model ensemble in the range 5\xe2\x80\x9312 ppm \xc2\xb0C\xe2\x88\x921, while lower values are found on shorter and longer time scales. These results are consistent with estimates derived from past observations. Up to centennial scales, the land carbon response to climate dominates the CO2 signal in the atmosphere, while on longer time scales the ocean becomes important and eventually dominates on multi-millennial scales. In addition to the time-scale dependence, modeled \\(\\varDelta CO_{2}/\\varDelta T\\) show a distinct dependence on the initial state of the system. In particular, on centennial time-scales, high \\(\\varDelta CO_{2}/\\varDelta T\\) values are correlated with high initial land carbon content. A similar relation holds also for the CMIP5 models, although for \\(\\varDelta CO_{2}/\\varDelta T\\) computed from a very different experimental setup. The emergence of common patterns like this could prove to usefully constrain the climate\xe2\x80\x93carbon cycle feedback.'

Abstract: 'Aerosol plays a very important role in climate change and public health. It affects cloud condensation nuclei and causes a number of epidemic diseases. The correlations of aerosol with epidemic diseases are due to the biotic components of aerosol. The present study deals with the measurements and characterization of bioaerosol over Indo-Gangetic plain. The levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are much higher than the recommended value set by NAAQS in India. Bacterial and fungal concentrations are in the reported range. Bacterial concentration is higher than fungal concentration. Gram-positive bacteria contribute 75\xc2\xa0% while gram-negative bacteria contribute 25\xc2\xa0% only. A total seven types of fungi are identified in aerosols. Aspergillus niger is dominant. Meteorological parameters play important roles in growth and presence of microorganism in the air. Bacterial concentrations are governed mainly by temperature while fungal concentration is influenced by relative humidity.'

Abstract: 'The new species Pyriculariopsis calatheae is described causing leaf spots on Calathea longifolia (Marantaceae). It represents an addition to the mycobiota of the tropical seasonal semi-deciduous montane forest, a component of the Brazilian Atlantic forest and a highly threatened ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'The disproportionate species richness of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity hotspots could be explained by low extinction (the evolutionary \xe2\x80\x9cmuseum\xe2\x80\x9d) and/or high speciation (the \xe2\x80\x9chot-bed\xe2\x80\x9d) models. We test these models using the largest of the species rich plant groups that characterise the botanically diverse Cape Floristic Region (CFR): the genus Erica L. We generate a novel phylogenetic hypothesis informed by nuclear and plastid DNA sequences of c. 60\xc2\xa0% of the c. 800 Erica species (of which 690 are endemic to the CFR), and use this to estimate clade ages (using RELTIME; BEAST), net diversification rates (GEIGER), and shifts in rates of diversification in different areas (BAMM; MuSSE).'

Abstract: 'The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of mini-Winkler extractor and pitfall traps as appropriate and complementary methods to sample ant communities in the phytophysiognomy mosaic in the Pocon\xc3\xa9 Pantanal region, state of Mato Grosso, Brasil. Seven units were studied for landscape, located within a 25\xc2\xa0km2 collection area, formed by thirty 250-m transects, at 1-km intervals in a 5\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x895\xc2\xa0km area. Five collection points were marked in each transect at 50-m intervals, totaling 150 points. A collection was made at each sampling point with mini-Winkler extractor and pitfall traps. Using the mini-Winkler extractor, 1,088 individuals were collected distributed in 20 genera and 55 species, with Solenopsis invicta Buren and Pheidole (gr. biconstricta) sp.1 as the most frequent ants. Using pitfall traps, 2,726 individuals distributed in 24 genera and 48 species were sampled and Dorymyrmex (gr. pyramicus) sp.1 and Pheidole (gr. biconstricta) sp.1 were the most frequent species. A significant difference between the methods was observed in measured species number. The Principal coordinates analysis discriminated two species groups exclusively sampled by the mini-Winkler extractor and another by the pitfall methods. Therefore, it was concluded that these methods were complementary for ant diversity inventories in the Pocon\xc3\xa9 Pantanal region.'

Abstract: 'Diversity in society can be viewed from two perspectives, normative and descriptive, both of which define how we think, discuss, and live. Normatively we are called to be responsible. This notion ideally depicts the vision of people of various backgrounds and beliefs living with an attitude of tolerance, respect, and the desire for justice. Descriptively, it is to recognize that people of diverse ethnic, social, economic, and philosophical backgrounds come together to live in various geographic locations, often resulting in heated tension and turmoil. Cultural backgrounds are a primary source of identity for many and serve as a foundation for a great deal of self-definition, expression, and sense of individual identity and group belonging.'

Abstract: 'The use of Hura crepitans (sandbox tree) seed as a biomass adsorbent was studied for the removal of phenol from aqueous solutions before extraction (HC) and after extraction (EHC) with hexane and methanol. The surface chemistry of HC and EHC was characterized by using the Boehm titration and pH drift while the removal of phenol from solution was monitored by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Decrease in the pH of solutions led to a significant increase in the adsorption capacity of HC and EHC. The linear regression of the experimental data showed that the Freundlich model fitted well with the values of adsorption capacity equal to 121 mmol/g for HC and 85 mmol/g for EHC, and the pseudo-second order kinetic model best described the adsorption process for HC and EHC. The experimental data indicated that the seed of Hura crepitans could be effectively used as an adsorbent for the removal of phenol from aqueous solutions.'

Abstract: 'By late 2017, governments had pledged more than 140\xc2\xa0M\xc2\xa0ha to the global forest landscape restoration (FLR) agenda. Although much FLR will consist of conventional ecological restoration, a substantial proportion will involve agroforestry. The question therefore arises of how the agroforestry germplasm needs of FLR can be met, particularly given its emphasis on species diversity. This paper examines the role of market-based germplasm supply systems. A simple analytic framework is presented, and key demand- and supply-related factors are described. It is suggested that seedling supply and demand at market prices will not necessarily coincide with needs of all farmers nor with the requirements of a particular restoration program, and that market-based germplasm supply systems will therefore often not meet the needs of restoration programs. Implications of these findings are then identified and appropriate responses are suggested. These include those intended to produce shifts in demand or supply curves through addressing the underlying enabling environment, and direct subsidies to tree planting stock prices.'

Abstract: ' Cryptococcosis is a mycosis caused by yeasts of genus Cryptococcus, mainly the species C. neoformans and C. gattii that can affect humans and animals. These yeasts are widely distributed in the environment and are typically associated with avian droppings and decaying wood. Most infections are related to the respiratory tract, but the central nervous system and cutaneous lesions are also reported in the literature. The present report is a case of cryptococcosis in an 18-month-old unspayed female English Bulldog with the main complaint of weight loss and diarrhea. The presence of two large masses observed in an ultrasound examination leads us to perform an exploratory laparotomy. Considering the size of the lesion and the impossibility of owner to provide intensive care, the consent for euthanasia was requested. The postmortem diagnosis of cryptococcosis was revealed by cytological evaluation, and the involvement of C. gattii VGII was confirmed by isolation and identification tests as well as by the detection of the URA5 gene restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR analysis. Reports in the literature of the involvement of Cryptococcus in gastrointestinal lesions are rare in both human and veterinary medicine. Data about different forms of cryptococcosis are important to provide more knowledge of uncommon clinical presentations of this yeast and therefore improve the diagnoses and decisions for the best therapy.'

Abstract: 'The Lacandon Maya of Chiapas, Mexico practice a system of swidden agroforestry that mimics the surrounding ecosystem and its successional stages. Their fields rotate through grass (milpa), and shrub (acahual) and forest fallow stages that regenerate soil, nutrients, and seed banks. Each successional stage, including the fallow stages, produces over 25 types of crops, raw materials, and medicines. Lacandon traditionally do not use fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. An emergy evaluation of Lacandon agroforestry was conducted to quantify resource use, productivity, environmental impact, and overall sustainability. Six systems were analyzed. The Emergy Yield Ratios of the systems ranged from 4.5 to 50.7, which indicated a high level of output per purchased investments. The agroforestry systems had minimal environmental impacts as shown by Environmental Loading Ratios between 0.03 and 0.38. The Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI) of the systems ranged from 12 to 1740, indicating a high level of sustainability. The high ESI values were partially due to a large fraction of renewable resources that varied from 0.72 to 0.97. ESI was dependent upon land area devoted to the system for each family, where greater land area resulted in higher values of ESI. Labor invested did not exhibit a direct effect on sustainability.'

Abstract: 'Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of leishmaniasis in Iran. As there is not any vaccine for leishmaniasis, treatment is important to prevent the spreading of parasites. There is, therefore, a need to develop newer drugs from different sources. The aim of this study was to assess anti-leishmanial activity of the ethanolic extracts of 17 different medicinal plants against Leishmania major promastigotes and macrophage cell line J774. The selection of the hereby studied 17 plants was based on the existing information on their local ethnobotanic history. Plants were dried, powdered, and macerated in a hydroalcoholic solution. Resulting extracts have been assessed for in vitro anti-leishmanial and brine shrimp toxicity activities. Four plants, Caesalpinia gilliesii, Satureia hortensis, Carum copticum heirm, and Thymus migricus, displayed high anti-leishmanial activity (IC50, 9.76\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.27, 15.625\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x893.76, 15.625\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895.46, and 31.25\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8915.44\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM, respectively) and were toxic against the J774 macrophage cell line at higher concentrations than those needed to inhibit the parasite cell growth (IC50, 45.13\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x893.17, 100.44\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8917.48, 43.76\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.78, and 39.67\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x893.29\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM, respectively). Glucantime as positive control inhibited the growth of L. major promastigotes with IC50\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89254\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml on promastigotes (1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89106/100\xc2\xa0\xce\xbc/well) of a log phase culture, without affecting the growth of J774 macrophages. These data revealed that C. gilliesii, S. hortensis, C. copticum heirm, and T. migricus extracts contain active compounds, which could serve as alternative agents in the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The activity of these herbs against L. major promastigotes and macrophage cell line J774 was reported for the first time in our study.'

Abstract: 'Over the past thirty years, it has often been stated that primary school education should endeavour to improve and protect the environment through producing an \xe2\x80\x98environmentally informed, committed and active citizenry\xe2\x80\x99. Even so, existing research shows that the implementation of environmental education in primary schools is problematic and has had limited success. However, the reasons for these shortcomings are far from clear, with present research merely speculating about barriers to effective implementation. This paper presents a detailed discussion and analysis of primary school teachers knowledge and beliefs about environmental concepts and environmental education. In so doing, the paper identifies a perceived gap within the field of environmental education research and literature. This field has neglected studies of Australian primary school teacher\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and beliefs about environmental education as a factor affecting the capacity of schooling to achieve environmental education goals. To these ends, we utilise the concept of \xe2\x80\x98environmental literacy\xe2\x80\x99 to assess primary school teacher\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and beliefs about environmental education. Based upon preliminary data analysis, we tentatively claim that current Queensland primary school teachers are variably committed to and demonstrably lack content knowledge of environmental concepts and environmental education. More significantly, these primary school teachers tend to dismiss the importance of content knowledge, preferring to focus upon attitudes towards environmental education and environmental concepts. Clearly these levels of environmental literacy are inadequate if environmentally literate students and thus an environmentally literate citizenry are to be achieved within schools. We conclude that the introduction of environmental literacy in educational policy would advance the goals of environmental education, namely the production of an informed, committed and active citizenry.'

Abstract: 'Extreme drought, precipitation, and other extreme climatic events often have impacts on vegetation. Based on meteorological data from 52 stations in the Loess Plateau (LP) and a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the third-generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) dataset, this study investigated the relationship between vegetation change and climatic extremes from 1982 to 2013. Our results showed that the vegetation coverage increased significantly, with a linear rate of 0.025/10a (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) from 1982 to 2013. As for the spatial distribution, NDVI revealed an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast, with about 61.79% of the LP exhibiting a significant increasing trend (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). Some temperature extreme indices, including TMAXmean, TMINmean, TN90p, TNx, TX90p, and TXx, increased significantly at rates of 0.77\xc2\xa0mm/10a, 0.52\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C/10a, 0.62\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C/10a, 0.80\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C/10a, 5.16\xc2\xa0days/10a, and 0.65\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C/10a, respectively. On the other hand, other extreme temperature indices including TX10p and TN10p decreased significantly at rates of \xe2\x88\x922.77\xc2\xa0days/10a and 4.57\xc2\xa0days/10a (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01), respectively. Correlation analysis showed that only TMINmean had a significant relationship with NDVI at the yearly time scale (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). At the monthly time scale, vegetation coverage and different vegetation types responded significantly positively to precipitation and temperature extremes (TMAXmean, TMINmean, TNx, TNn, TXn, and TXx) (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01). All of the precipitation extremes and temperature extremes exhibited significant positive relationships with NDVI during the spring and autumn (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01). However, the relationship between NDVI and RX1day, TMAXmean, TXn, and TXx was insignificant in summer. Vegetation exhibited a significant negative relationship with precipitation extremes in winter (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). In terms of human activity, our results indicate a strong correlation between the cumulative afforestation area and NDVI in Yan\xe2\x80\x99an and Yulin during 1998\xe2\x80\x932013, r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.859 and 0.85, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa016, P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001.'

Abstract: 'The advance of agricultural frontier may cause the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) to disappear before 2030. This work focuses on measuring the impact of pasture implantation on a cerrado\xe2\x80\x99s termite fauna. Termites were sampled in a cerrado sensu stricto and a pasture, originally cerrado. All species were classified as their feeder group, accumulation curves were made and Shannon-Wiener indexes and \xce\xb2 diversity were calculated for both areas. Cerrado was richer than pasture and species composition differed considerably, leading \xce\xb2 diversity to a high value. The humivorous was the most representative species, followed by grass/litter feeders, xylophagous and, less representative, the intermediates. There were more xylophagous and intermediates species on cerrado than in pasture; the grass/litter feeders were more abundant in pasture, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t differed in number or species; and humivorous didn\xe2\x80\x99t differed neither in richness nor in abundance. This work shows that the simplification of the habitat is indeed causing the extinction of populations that depend on some specifics resource.'

Abstract: 'The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioaccessibility of Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Zn in cat\xe2\x80\x99s claw plant teas through in vitro gastrointestinal digestion with gastric and intestinal juice solutions. The total concentrations and bioaccessible fractions of Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Zn were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The results obtained showed that Zn was the most bioaccessible element in the teas, contributing a mean of 57.9% by infusion and 62.5% by decoction. Among macroelements, the Ca was less bioaccessible with 17.4% recovery. The bioavailability assessment revealed that daily intake of 200\xc2\xa0ml of cat\xe2\x80\x99s claw teas cover about 1.0% of manganese RDA.'

Abstract: 'Allometric models are necessary for estimating biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. Generalized allometric relationship exists for many tropical trees, but species- and region-specific models are often lacking. We developed species-specific allometric models to predict aboveground biomass for 11 native tree species of the Sudanian savanna-woodlands. Diameters at the base and at breast height, with species means ranging respectively from 11 to 28 cm and 9 to 19 cm, and the height of the trees were used as predictor variables. Sampled trees spanned a wide range of sizes including the largest sizes these species can reach. As a response variable, the biomass of the trees was obtained through destructive sampling of 4 754 trees during wood harvesting. We used a stepwise multiple regression analysis with backward elimination procedure to develop models separately predicting, total biomass of the trees, stem biomass, and biomass of branches and twigs. All species-specific regression models relating biomass with measured tree dimensions were highly significant (p < 0.001). The biomass of branches and twigs was less predictable compared to stem biomass and total biomass, although their models required fewer predictors and predictor interactions. The best-fit equations for total above-ground biomass and stem biomass had R 2 > 0.70, except for the Acacia species; for branches including twig biomass, R2-values varied from 0.749 for Anogeissus leiocarpa to 0.183 for Acacia macrostachya. The use of these equations in estimating available biomass will avoid destructive sampling, and aid in planning for sustainable use of these species.'

Abstract: 'Malaria remains a major health problem in French Guiana, with a mean of 3800 cases each year. A previous study in Camopi, an Amerindian village on the Oyapock River, highlighted the major contribution of environmental features to the incidence of malaria attacks. We propose a method for the objective selection of the best multivariate peridomestic landscape characterisation that maximises the chances of identifying relationships between environmental features and malaria incidence, statistically significant and meaningful from an epidemiological point of view.'

Abstract: 'Naturally rare species have a higher probability of stochastic extinction due to genetic, demographic, or environmental hazards; human disturbance may intensify these threats. Rare species may therefore be in need of short-term intervention to survive. The ecosystem with the second highest biodiversity in Brazil, the Cerrado, is suffering from fragmentation and threats to its flora. Dimorphandra wilsonii, a 30-m tall endemic tree of the Brazilian Cerrado, is listed as critically endangered; only 21 adult trees have been identified. We carried out mating system and pollen flow analyses to understand the current gene flow and limitations in the reproduction of D. wilsonii. With seven fluorescently labelled microsatellite primers, we genotyped 20 adult trees and 269 progeny from 13 mother trees. D. wilsonii displayed low levels of genetic diversity; bottleneck events are likely to have occurred (H  e \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.60 and 0.29; H  o \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.71 and 0.33, for adults and progeny, respectively). This species is predominantly outcrossing (t  m \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.88), with some selfing (1-t  m \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.12), as well as crossing between related individuals (t  m -t  s \xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.11). None of the studied trees was reproductively isolated; a high proportion of pollen (55\xc2\xa0%) came from trees yet to be discovered. Two genetic clusters (Northern and Southern) were identified, with high values of genetic divergence among the Southern sites. Planting of seedlings and monitoring of seed dispersion in order to maintain the genetic diversity and genetic structure of D. wilsonii are strategies that may ensure the continuation of D. wilsonii, but this species does not seem to require reproductive intervention to remain viable.'

Abstract: 'During past glacial periods, many species of forest-dwelling animals experienced range contractions. In contrast, species living outside such moist habitats appear to have reacted to Quaternary changes in different ways. The Atlantic Forest represents an excellent opportunity to test phylogeographic hypotheses, because it has a wide range of vegetation types, including unforested habitats covered predominantly by herbaceous and shrubby plants, which are strongly influenced by the harsh environment with strong wind and high insolation. Here, we investigated the distribution of genetic diversity in the endemic sand dune ant Mycetophylax simplex across its known range along the Brazilian coast, with the aim of contributing to the understanding of alternative phylogeographic patterns. We used partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I and nuclear gene wingless from 108 specimens and 51 specimens, respectively, to assess the phylogeography and demographic history of this species. To achieve this we performed different methods of phylogenetic and standard population genetic analyses.'

Abstract: 'Starch branching enzyme (SBE) is one of the key enzymes involved in starch biosynthetic metabolism. In this study, six SBE family genes were identified from the cassava genome. Phylogenetic analysis divided the MeSBE family genes into dicot family A, B, C, and the new group. Tissue-specific analysis showed that MeSBE2.2 was strongly expressed in leaves, stems cortex, and root stele, and MeSBE3 had high expression levels in stem cortex and root stele of plants in the rapid growth stage under field condition, whereas the expression levels of MeSBE2.1, MeSBE4, and MeSBE5 were low except for in stems cortex. The transcriptional activity of MeSBE2.2 and MeSBE3 was higher compared with other members and gradually increased in the storage roots during root growth process, while the other MeSBE members normally remained low expression levels. Expression of MeSBE2.2 could be induced by salt, drought, exogenous abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid signals, while MeSBE3 had positive response to drought, salt, exogenous abscisic acid, and salicylic acid in leaves but not in storage root, indicating that they might be more important in starch biosynthesis pathway under diverse environments.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated the effect of tropical dry forest edges in fragments on reptile structure and ecological groups, and their relationship to 15 environmental variables in the Caribbean Region, Colombia. We used 15 pasture-edge-interior gradients and 12 permanent linear transects per gradient, sampling them on three occasions between January and December 2006. We recorded 35 species (pasture: 15, forest edge: 28, forest interior: 16). Reptile structure was different along the pasture-edge-interior gradient and the magnitude of the influence of the edge effect on the abundance of the most common species changed from the dry to rainy season. We identified seven ecological groups based on three fixed functional traits: species habit, size and reproductive mode. The proportion of species belonging to each ecological group was different between the pasture and forest habitats, but there were no differences between the forest edge and its interior. Four of the seven ecological groups inhabited pasture and the forest interior, and all of the ecological groups were represented in the forest edge. The ecological group with oviparous small and diurnal species accounted for the 50\xc2\xa0% of the species inhabiting the forest interior. Reptile structure and ecological groups were both related to patch size, elevation, herbaceous cover, percentage of bare soil and temperature, but explanatory power differed. We suggest that the conservation and management of tropical dry forest reptiles should take into account species traits so that rather than using information for a single species, a more generalized community approach is used.'

Abstract: 'We examine in discrete time the management of a flow pollutant that causes damage when it crosses a fixed but unknown threshold. The manager sequentially chooses a pollution level that allows learning about the threshold, thereby improving future decisions. If crossed, damage can be reversed at some cost. We analyze the conditions under which experimentation is optimal, and explore how experimentation depends on restoration costs, information about the threshold, and the discount rate. Our results suggest that the level of experimentation, defined as the difference between the optimal activity with and without learning, is non-monotonic in costs and decreasing in the discount rate. We identify two stopping boundaries for the experiment, depending on cost levels compared to the lower bound of the threshold\xe2\x80\x99s interval. We show that when costs are high the stopping boundary under an infinite number of decisions is the same as when there are only two decision moments. A computational extension to more than two decisions suggests that an optimal sequence of experiments can cross the same threshold several times before experimentation ceases. These results shed light on a large class of environmental decision problems that has not been examined in the literature.'

Abstract: 'The FLORES simulation model aims to capture the interactions between rural communities living at the forest margin and the resources that they depend upon, in order to provide decision-makers with a tool that they can use to explore the consequences of alternative policy options. A key component of the model is simulating how decision-making agents within the system (individuals, households and the whole village) go about making their decisions. The model presented here is based on an anthropological description of the rules and relationships that people use, rather than on the assumption that people behave in an economically optimal fashion. The approach addresses both short-term decision-making (primarily the allocation of labour to various activities on a weekly basis), and long-term strategic land-use planning, taking into account the variety of tenure and inheritance patterns that operate in real communities. The decision-making sub-model has been implemented in the Rantau Pandan (Sumatra) version of FLORES, using the Simile modelling environment.'

Abstract: 'The present study aimed at analyzing the spatio-temporal variability of the Pantanal vegetation cover, the largest tropical wetland in the world. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to a complete annual dataset of filtered EVI2 images (based on a 12-year average over the 2001\xe2\x80\x932012 period). There was about 99\xc2\xa0% variance concentration in the first three components, with the respective loading responses and distributions (maximum, minimum and changes in the sign of the eigenvector loadings) matching the most significant seasonal interruptions. The first three principal components showed the essential aspects of the spatio-temporal variability of the local phenology, i.e. the cumulative greenness throughout the year, the later and more generalized senescence associated with the drought season climax, and the early senescence associated with sandy portions. Our results enabled the detection of homologous areas regarding vegetation density and the time and intensity of senescence. As the water availability throughout the year\xe2\x80\x94the most important parameter for regional vegetation\xe2\x80\x94is largely a function of geology (sediment grain size and vertical neotectonic), a geobotanic analysis of the Pantanal wetlands was also possible. Our PCA-based approach was able to capture the essentials of the phenological/environmental variability, with potential for application in other ecosystems with complex vegetation cover and functioning.'

Abstract: 'The human evolution is directly associated to the use of materials. During the last century, humanity had significant development powered by the use of fossil resources, which largely impacted the materials discovery and use. However, there are many concerns about the use of fossils, based mainly on economic and environmental issues. These concerns motivate the study, development, and use of renewable resources, including biobased materials. Brazil is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities, which can be used to produce renewable materials. This review describes actual production of some renewable materials in Brazil and future possibilities to generate them using biomass residual streams of industrial processes.'

Abstract: 'Russia\xe2\x80\x99s division into two, principally its European and Asian, parts looks very traditional. However, this regionalization does not necessarily coincide with division into West and East, which concerns internal spatial proportions and asymmetry of the country rather than its cultural identity and other not quite geographical connotations. The article clarifies the concept and the border of Eastern Russia and its position in the country and the world. Some of the economic, geopolitical, and other characteristics of the East, with its comparative advantages and disadvantages, are identified and discussed. It was determined that the strong socioeconomic sparseness of Eastern Russia has always been and remains the consequence of persistent underdevelopment of the territory, associated with harsh natural conditions, history, and geographical asymmetry of the exploration process. At the same time, Eastern Russia is a huge resource-ecological and ethnocultural reserve and not only Russian. Eastern Russia makes the country what it is, and it stands out in the world\xe2\x80\x94the first in total area; transcontinental and interoceanic in geographical location; rich in natural resources; and diverse in culture and historical traditions. This part of Russia reflects such a common feature of the country as the East\xe2\x80\x93West asymmetry of its development.'

Abstract: 'The loss of traditional knowledge, concomitant with changes in livelihoods, languages, and demographics of indigenous and local groups, is a global concern. However, documenting such loss poses serious methodological challenges. Comparing the results of contemporary studies with past research is often problematic due to methodological differences. Here, comparing studies that attempted to document the traditional ethnobotanical knowledge of the Ch\xc3\xa1cobo of Bolivia, we tried to examine whether knowledge loss was really occurring across more than 100\xc2\xa0years or was only researcher\xe2\x80\x99s perception. The Ch\xc3\xa1cobo are a Panoan-speaking tribe of about 1000 members, first visited by researchers in 1911, and subsequently in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Each study had different foci, but all recorded ethnobotanical data. The first more detailed anthropological report exists from the late 1960s, and ecological-ethnobotanical studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on available literature, in particular the botanical studies of Boom (1987) and Bergeron (1998), it seemed that Ch\xc3\xa1cobo plant use now centers on income generation. Both Boom (1987) and Bergeron (1998) perceived that traditional plant use related to household artifacts and medicine, as well as traditional crop varieties had almost disappeared. Here, we hypothesized that plant knowledge documented and the perception of so-called knowledge loss observed in these depended completely on the background of the interviewers and the methods employed, and that in a sufficiently comprehensive ethnobotanical study, we would be able to document all species and uses mentioned in previous studies. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a complete ethnobotanical inventory of almost the entire adult Ch\xc3\xa1cobo population, with interviews and plant collection conducted directly by Ch\xc3\xa1cobo counterparts. The results verify our initial hypothesis and showed that the loss of knowledge perceived in previous studies simply was an artifact of the research methods employed. Traditional crop varieties are still widely grown, most Ch\xc3\xa1cobo know, and can name, traditional artifacts, and many still know the names and uses of medicinal species. However, some knowledge, including the manufacture of artifacts and proficient identification of many medicinal plants, is limited to the older generation.'

Abstract: 'Since the late 1970s, ecologists interested in forest dynamics have focused their attention to the responses of individuals, populations and communities to \xe2\x80\x9cgaps\xe2\x80\x9d which are openings created in the forest canopy. This review intended to introduce some collective knowledge on major subjects of the gap theory in forest dynamics, in relation to gap-disturbance regimes, tree regeneration behaviour and community structure.'

Abstract: 'Forests make up large ecosystems and can play an important role in mitigating the emissions of CO2, the most important greenhouse gas. However, they are sources of atmospheric carbon when they are disturbed by human or natural causes. Storage of carbon through expansion and adaptive management of forest ecosystems can assist in reducing carbon concentrations in atmosphere. This study proposes a methodology to produce spatially explicit estimates of the carbon storages (aboveground plus belowground) depending on land use/cover changes in two different forest ecosystems during various periods. Carbon storages for each forest ecosystem were projected according to inventory data, and carbon storages were mapped in a geographic information system (GIS). Results showed that total carbon stored in above and belowground of both forest ecosystems increased from one period to other because of especially increase of productive forest areas and decline of degraded forest areas as well as protection of spruce forests subject to insect attacks.'

Abstract: 'Forest managers and policy makers increasingly demand to have access to estimates of forest fragmentation, human accessibility to forest areas and levels of anthropogenic pressure on the remaining forests to integrate them into monitoring systems, management and conservation plans. Forest fragmentation is defined as the breaking up of a forest unit, where the number of patches and the amount of expose edge increase while the amount of core area decreases. Forest fragmentation studies in Mexico have been limited to local or regional levels and have concentrated only on specific forest types. This paper presents an assessment of the fragmentation of all forest types at the national level, their effective proximity to anthropogenic influences, and the development of an indicator of anthropogenic pressure on the forests areas. Broadleaf forests, tropical evergreen forests and tropical dry deciduous forests show the greatest fragmentation. Almost half (47%) of the tropical forests are in close effective proximity to anthropogenic influences and only 12% of their area can be considered isolated from anthropogenic influences. The values for the temperate forests are 23% and 29% respectively. Anthropogenic pressure in the immediate vicinity of anthropogenic activities is much higher in the tropical forests (75 in a scale 0\xe2\x80\x93100) than in the temperate forests (30). When considering these results jointly, the tropical forests, and more specifically, the tropical evergreen forests and tropical dry deciduous forests are under the greatest pressure and risks of degradation.'

Abstract: 'Regional nitrogen budgets are useful for assessing what is known about nitrogen cycling in important ecosystems of a region, for placing the various regional fluxes and pools into perspective, and for providing insight into the processes that regulate both regional and global nitrogen cycling. Existing regional budgest have been used both to study groundwater nitrate pollution and to help identify local ecosystems that are important on a land-use basis but that are poorly described biogeochemically. Avoidable problems common to many budgets include inappropriate compartment components, inadequate documentation, and unjustified certainty. Though imprecise, large-scale nutrient budgets at our present stage of understanding offer to researchers and system managers important advantages that would otherwise not be available.'

Abstract: 'A growing dilemma faces tropical foresters. Their activities must be production orientated, yet at the same time the tropical forests themselves are disappearing rapidly. In this paper, land use is analysed as a key factor, and is related to growing population pressures and a growing export market for tropical timber and for beef raised on pastures established at the expense of former forests.'

Abstract: 'Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a pandemic and a public health emergency. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes genus. In light of no treatment currently, it is crucial to develop effective vector control programs to prevent the spread of ZIKV infection earlier when observing possible risk factors, such as weather conditions enhancing mosquito breeding and surviving.'

Abstract: 'Tropical water-terrestrial ecotones play important roles in regulating the flow of materials from and to land and water ecosystems. Ecotones exist where active interactions between two or more adjacent ecosystems occur with the appearance of processes that do not exist in either of the adjacent ecosystems.They occur naturally depending on the hydrological and geomorphological structure of the location. External and internal processes can influence the origin and persistence of ecotones. Ecotones regulate the landscape mosaic, affect energy flow between adjacent systems and intervene in landscape connectivity.'

Abstract: 'In financially and human capacity poor countries, there is an important need to monitor the status of resource rich ecosystems in the face of growing extractive activities in simple and inexpensive ways. In this study we explore the potential of using birds as indicators of ecosystem change in the wetland systems of the North Rupununi, Guyana, where local communities rely heavily on wetland resources for their subsistence activities. This is done by (1) assessing what environmental factors determine bird communities at different spatial and temporal scales; and (2) identifying indicator groups and/or species for ecosystem status. We surveyed 31 wetland sites over 2\xc2\xa0years, taking monthly recordings of both the environmental features of waterbodies using a modified version of the River Habitat Survey and bird species counts. Using multivariate analyses, we found that large-scale habitat type, namely forest and savanna, and waterbody type, namely pond or main river channel, were the main factors affecting bird species distribution. At the smaller scale, habitat features around the waterbody and seasonality become important factors. We were able to identify lists of bird species associated with different waterbody types, and we present this as a checklist for future monitoring. We hope these findings can be integrated into the adaptive management and sustainable livelihood goals of the local stakeholders through linking monitoring with tourism and local school curriculum activities.'

Abstract: 'An ethnopharmacological survey showed that home remedies prepared with flowers and fruits ofPsychotria colorata are used by Amazonian peasants as pain killers. Psychopharmacological in vivo evaluation of alkaloids obtained from leaves and flowers of this species showed a marked dose-dependent naloxone-reversible analgesic activity, therefore suggesting an opioid-like pharmacological profile. This paper reports an inhibitory effect ofP. colorata flower alkaloids on [3H]naloxone binding in rat striata as well as a decrease in adenylate cyclase basal activity. The alkaloids did not affect [3H] GMP-PNP binding. These findings provide a neurochemical basis for the opioid-like activity previously detected in vivo and point toPsychotria alkaloids as a potential source of new bioactive opiate derivatives.'

Abstract: 'The order Sirenia is represented by three species of manatees and one species of dugong distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and considered vulnerable to extinction. The sentinel species concept is useful to identify indicators of the environment and may reflect the quality of health in marine ecosystems. The single species approach to evaluate ecological health may provide a series of \xe2\x80\x9csnap shots\xe2\x80\x9d of environmental changes to determine if animal, human, or ecosystem health may be affected. Under this concept, marine vertebrates may be good integrators of changes over space and time, and excellent sentinels of ecosystem health. Based on their life history, manatees may or may not be ideal sentinels, as they are robust, long-lived species and appear remarkably resilient to natural disease and the effects of human-related injury and trauma. These characteristics might be the result of an efficient and responsive immune system compared to other marine mammals. Although relatively immune to infectious agents, manatees face other potentially serious threats, including epizootic diseases and pollution while in large aggregations. Manatees can serve as excellent sentinels of harmful algal blooms due to their high sensitivity, specifically to brevetoxicosis,  which has caused at least two major die-offs in recent times. Threats to manatees worldwide, such as illegal hunting and boat collisions, are increasing. Habitat is being lost at an alarming rate and the full effects of uncontrolled human population growth on the species are unknown. The manatee may serve as a sentinel species, prognosticating the deleterious effects of unhealthy marine and aquatic ecosystems on humans. We have identified a number of critical research needs and opportunities for transdisciplinary collaboration that could help advance the use of the sentinel species concept in marine ecosystem health and monitoring of disease emergence using our knowledge on these magnificent sirenians.'

Abstract: 'We examined the relationships between topography, soil properties and tree species composition in a Neotropical swamp forest in southeastern Brazil. Plots were sampled in the forest, encompassing three different soil ground water regimes along the topographical declivity. All non-climbing plant individuals with trunk height >1.3\xc2\xa0m were sampled. A canonical correspondence analysis\xe2\x80\x94CCA\xe2\x80\x94of the species\xe2\x80\x93environmental relationships grouped tree species according to drainage and chemical soil conditions. A total of 86 species were found, being 77 species in the inferior, 40 species in the intermediate and 35 species in the superior topographic section. Some species were among the 10 most abundant ones, both in the overall sampled area and in each topographical section, with alternation events occurring only with their abundance position. However, substantial differences in floristic composition between sections were detected in a fine spatial scale, due to higher number of species, diversity index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) and species unique (exclusives) in the inferior topographic section. These higher values can be attributed to its higher spatial heterogeneity that included better drained and seasonally waterlogged soils, higher soil fertility and lower acidity. The increase of the soil water saturation and the uniform conditions derived from the superficial water layer has led to a lower number of species and an increase on the palm trees abundance in the intermediate and superior sections. Our results showed that at a small spatial scale niche differentiation must be an important factor related to the increase of the local diversity. The wide distribution of the most abundant species in the studied area and the increase of local diversity corroborate the pattern of distribution of species in larger scales of swamp forests, in which the most abundant species repeat themselves in high densities in different remnants. However, the floristic composition of each remnant is strongly variable, contributing to the increase of regional diversity.'

Abstract: 'International non-profit organizations have started to implement eco-labeling for credence attributes programs aimed to inform consumers about environmentally sound or \xe2\x80\x9csustainable\xe2\x80\x9d production standards for various products. Using coffee labeled as \xe2\x80\x9cshade grown\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbird friendly\xe2\x80\x9d as an example, this paper describes the impact such labeling programs may have on local land use patterns in coffee producing regions. Shade grown coffee farms should provide a variety of external benefits, including the preservation of biodiversity, carbon sequestration, the prevention of soil erosion and aquifer recharge. Those externalities, however, are not expected to have observable land use impacts unless they are capitalized in the coffee market. The prospect of market capitalization of externalities suggests the extension of the conventional von Th\xc3\xbcnen model to the calculation of social location rent. Using the maximization of social location rent as a criterion allows the externality effect to play a direct role in market-based land use allocation of land between eco-labeled shade grown coffee production and other activities.'

Abstract: 'The capability of an improved Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) in reproducing the impact of climate on the terrestrial ecosystem is evaluated. The new model incorporates the Community Land Model-DGVM (CLM3.0-DGVM) with a submodel for temperate and boreal shrubs, as well as other revisions such as the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-leaf\xe2\x80\x9d scheme for photosynthesis and the definition of fractional coverage of plant functional types (PFTs). Results show that the revised model may correctly reproduce the global distribution of temperate and boreal shrubs, and improves the model performance with more realistic distribution of different vegetation types. The revised model also correctly reproduces the zonal distributions of vegetation types. In reproducing the dependence of the vegetation distribution on climate conditions, the model shows that the dominant regions for trees, grasses, shrubs, and bare soil are clearly separated by a climate index derived from mean annual precipitation and temperature, in good agreement with the CLM4 surface data. The dominant plant functional type mapping to a two dimensional parameter space of mean annual temperature and precipitation also qualitatively agrees with the results from observations and theoretical ecology studies.'

Abstract: 'Dothideomycetes comprise a highly diverse range of fungi characterized mainly by asci with two wall layers (bitunicate asci) and often with fissitunicate dehiscence. Many species are saprobes, with many asexual states comprising important plant pathogens. They are also endophytes, epiphytes, fungicolous, lichenized, or lichenicolous fungi. They occur in terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats in almost every part of the world. We accept 105 families in Dothideomycetes with the new families Anteagloniaceae, Bambusicolaceae, Biatriosporaceae, Lichenoconiaceae, Muyocopronaceae, Paranectriellaceae, Roussoellaceae, Salsugineaceae, Seynesiopeltidaceae and Thyridariaceae introduced in this paper. Each family is provided with a description and notes, including asexual and asexual states, and if more than one genus is included, the type genus is also characterized. Each family is provided with at least one figure-plate, usually illustrating the type genus, a list of accepted genera, including asexual genera, and a key to these genera. A phylogenetic tree based on four gene combined analysis add support for 64 of the families and 22 orders, including the novel orders, Dyfrolomycetales, Lichenoconiales, Lichenotheliales, Monoblastiales, Natipusillales, Phaeotrichales and Strigulales. The paper is expected to provide a working document on Dothideomycetes which can be modified as new data comes to light. It is hoped that by illustrating types we provide stimulation and interest so that more work is carried out in this remarkable group of fungi.'

Abstract: "Transect surveys of adult butterflies were conducted along fixed routes at 27 study sites grouped into three subregions of tallgrass prairie and one subregion of pine-oak barrens in the midwestern USA. Within subregion, each site was visited the same number of times over 5\xe2\x80\x937 years on similar dates with similar weather. For each site, five indices of species richness and/or abundance were calculated both for total butterflies and for specialist species primarily restricted to native herbaceous vegetation. These indices were then analysed as to how much they agreed or conflicted in site ranking and how site rankings based on total butterflies compared to those based on specialists. Variation in site ranking by different indices was relatively low. Mean site rank by specialist indices covaried significantly with mean site rank by indices for total butterflies. Numerous studies have shown that on a regional scale, areas of higher richness for all species in a taxonomic group are different habitat types (based on amount of canopy or degree of degradation) from \xe2\x80\x9chotspots\xe2\x80\x9d for that taxon's subset of species of conservation concern (endemics or specialists). But in this study, within a habitat type, site rankings based on total butterflies significantly tended to agree with site rankings based on specialist butterflies. This suggests that site prioritization and management favouring specialist butterflies would also favour the overall butterfly fauna possible in the same habitat."

Abstract: 'The Pacific and Atlantic oceanic influences on observational rainfall data from weather stations over Venezuela are analyzed using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) executed in the Climate Predictability Tool. CCA is further conducted on rainfall and sea surface temperature data obtained from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) for historical (1951\xe2\x80\x932010) and future (2041\xe2\x80\x932100) periods. Four oceanic regions (North Tropical Atlantic, Ni\xc3\xb1o3, Ni\xc3\xb1o3.4 and an area which includes all previous three) are used for the CCA using data from the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) data set, while precipitation data from two regions: a coastal region and an inland region are used in the analysis. Venezuelan seasons (dry and wet) were separated into an early and a late period. The oceanic impact on the precipitation of the station data is, in the majority of the cases, higher in the inland than at the coast. The Pacific\xe2\x80\x99s influence is stronger in the early dry season than in the wet season, whereas the Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s influence is stronger in the wet season (inland). In contrast, CCA applied to the model data provides highest correlation coefficients in the late wet season for all oceanic regions. In most cases the North Tropical Atlantic has a stronger influence than the Ni\xc3\xb1o regions.'

Abstract: 'This study was conducted in the Chiapas Highlands, a tropical mountain region where traditional agricultural practices have resulted in a mosaic landscape of forest fragments embedded in a matrix of secondary vegetation and crop fields. The question addressed was how may woody species richness be affected by forest fragment attributes derived from traditional land-use patterns. Species inventories of total woody species, canopy and understorey trees, and shrubs were obtained in 22 forest fragments (\xe2\x89\xa55 ha). Multiple regression analyses were applied to examine the effects of size, matrix, isolation and shape of the forest fragments on richness of these species guilds. Fragment size was correlated with shape (r = 0.75) and isolation (r = \xe2\x88\x920.69), and isolation was correlated with shape (r = \xe2\x88\x920.75). Total species richness, and number of shrubs and understorey trees in fragments were related to isolation; moreover, additive effects of fragment shape were found for shrubs. The number of canopy species was not related to any fragment variable. Matrix did not help to explain species richness, possibly due to the landscape structure created by the traditional land-use patterns. In addition to size and isolation, we point out the need of considering shape and matrix as additional fragmentation attributes, along with social and economic factors, if we are ever going to be successful in our management and conservation actions.'

Abstract: ' Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and C. gattii were repeatedly isolated from decaying wood of trunk hollows in living trees growing in Jabalpur City in Central India. The isolation of C.\xe2\x90\xa3gattii has been reported from decayed wood inside trunk hollow of Tamarindus indica (15.6%), Mangifera indica (2.2%), Pithecolobium dulce (12.5%), Syzygium cumini (14%), and one from bark of S.\xe2\x90\xa3cumini. C. n. var. grubii was isolated from decaying wood debris of T. indica (4.4%), M. indica (13.3%), Terminalia arjuna (25%), S. cumini (2%), Cassia fistula (4.5%), and two from bark of S. cumini. The two varieties never co-occurred in the same hollow. C. gattii and C. n. var. grubii isolates belonged to serotype B and serotype A respectively. The data strongly supported the colonization of the pathogen in\xe2\x90\xa3decaying wood hollow of all six-tree species. Evidence of this was found by repeated isolation up to 820\xc2\xa0days. P. dulce is being reported for the first time as natural habitat of C. gattii and T.\xe2\x90\xa3arjuna and C. fistula as natural habitat for C. n. var. grubii. M. indica is being reported for the second time as the natural habitat of both varieties (C. n. var. grubii and C. gattii). The population density of these pathogens from decaying wood debris of various tree species ranged between 0.5\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0103 cells/g and 6\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0105 cells/g. The seasonal variation has been seen in isolation of this yeast. Our result further reinforce the recently emerging evidence that the natural habitat of C. n. var. grubii and C. gattii is more generalized.'

Abstract: 'Some of the proximate factors that would induce aboveground stems to produce adventitious roots were investigated experimentally on Senecio cooperi, a tropical cloud forest tree. Stem segments were air-layered with different treatments to promote root formation, and the number of roots initiated and rates of root growth were monitored for 20 weeks. Treatments were the application of wet epiphytes or dry epiphytes plus associated humus, sponges wetted with either water or nutrient solutions, or dry sponges. Controls (stem segments with nothing applied) were also monitored. Numbers of adventitious roots formed and rates of subsequent root growth differed among treatments. Wet epiphyte/humus and nutrient solutions were most effective in producing roots, which suggests that epiphytes and the nutrients they intercept and retain within the canopy may cue adjacent host tissue to exploit this resource.'

Abstract: 'Examining the rise and fall of a public\xe2\x80\x93private marine biotechnological enterprise in Hawaii, this article analyses how promises to make products and profits from marine microbes in archipelagic waters drew upon peculiarly American sentiments about the sea as a politically uncontested treasure-chest of biodiversity. I argue that attention to the material process by which lab and legal instruments are calibrated to one another to generate biotech exchange-value must be joined by consideration of how scientists and their interlocutors imagine the meaning of biology\xe2\x80\x94as discipline and as corporeal substance and process. Without such symbolic analysis, theorizations of biocapital remain incomplete. To discuss the genre of capitalism evidenced in marine biotechnological endeavors in Hawaii, I develop the concept of blue-green capitalism, where blue stands for a vision of the freedom of the open ocean and for speculative sky-high promise, and green for belief in ecological sustainability as well as biological fecundity. I show that this vision, dominant in industry\xe2\x80\x93university settings, ran into direct conflict with Native Hawaiian legal epistemologies of the sea.'

Abstract: 'It is important to study the effect of tree density on the substrate quality and decomposition rate of leaf litter in plantations. In 2002, an experiment of the effects of thinning intensities at four different levels (i.e., 0 (I), 35.7% (II), 49.2% (III), and 64.2% (IV)) on undergrowth were carried out in an 18-year-old Pinus tabulaeformis plantation at an initial density of 3130 trees/hm2 in the middle of the hills of Yingpan, Yanqing County, Beijing. Three years later, the rates of decomposition, the amount of nutrients returned, and the characteristics of leaf litter were compared by a litter bag method. The results show that the annual loss of dry matter of leaf litter in plots I, II, III, and IV was 25.81%, 26.25%, 27.68%, and 25.96%, respectively. The turnover of leaf litter was 10.04, 9.84, 9.24, and 9.97 years, respectively. Therefore, it is feasible and convenient to evaluate the effect of thinning on the rate of decomposition. In the first two months, the N, P, K, and Mg nutrients were released quickly. During the entire observation period of 14 months, the return of both N and Mg nutrients in the four plots exhibited a release-accumulation type of cycle. The return of P and K indicated a trend of release-accumulation and a relative balance. However, the return of Ca was far different from that of the other nutrients in the four plots. The total nutrient return of the four elements N, P, K, and Mg in the plots was 10.806, 31.016, 31.798, and 39.365 g/kg, respectively. Specifically, the quality of leaf litter in plot I was the worst in that N and Ca accumulated only 2.567 and 0.767 g/kg, respectively. Thinning did decrease the ratios of lignin to N and C to N and accelerated the rate of decomposition of leaf litter. The content of crude ash in leaf litter was enhanced by thinning, which prevented acid material, such as tannins and resins, from returning to the soil. The effect of thinning intensity was evaluated by the ratio of lignin to N, the ratio of C to N, and the ash content in leaf litter.'

Abstract: 'The Darling River, in New South Wales, Australia, is a large semi-arid system with a highly variable flow regime, characterised by unpredictable events of flooding and drought. In large lowland rivers like the Darling, lateral (river-floodplain) interactions can greatly influence both physical and biological components of the system. The floodplain and riparian zone of the Darling River is dominated by River Red Gum (RRG), Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The large amount of organic matter they produce accumulates on the floodplain and on benches within the channel, and is subject to alternate periods of flooding and drying as a result of highly variable flows. This paper examines the effect of alternate periods of flooding and drying on the processing of E. camaldulensis organic matter. Results of the 6-month in situ field study, together with results from laboratory experiments comparing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release from various RRG litter types, suggest that RRG leaves provide the most bio-available source of carbon to the system, while bark may be more important as a habitat for invertebrates and other fauna. Laboratory experiments exploring the effect of drying and re-flooding on litter breakdown and release of DOC suggested that the majority of DOC was released from RRG leaves in the first 24 h of inundation. Also, upon drying and re-flooding of the leaves, a smaller but significant release of DOC occurred. However, an alternative wet/dry cycle did not affect weight loss of the leaf litter. Results of the field and lab experiments suggest that RRG leaves represent an important source of carbon to the Darling River, with inputs being influenced by the highly variable flow regime.'

Abstract: 'The Passiflora L. (Passifloraceae) genus consists of about 500 species widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical regions, commonly known as the passion flower. The passion flowers are considered ornamental plants because of the exotic beauty of their flowers and variant foliage. Since their introduction to the Old World, around 1625, seventeenth century, they have been used to decorate European glasshouses and gardens. Interspecific hybridization is used to produce single ornamental plants. However in some countries, such as Brazil, being centre of origin of many species, the potential value of these species has hardly been exploited. The beauty of these wild species and their hybrids is little known in Brazil. Therefore it is here intended to highlight the productive and commercial potential of the passion flowers for the purpose to generate an income in family agriculture, while maintaining the ecological balance and optimizing the use of natural resources.'

Abstract: 'The need to avert unacceptable and irreversible environmental change is the most urgent challenge facing society. Landscape ecology has the capacity to help address these challenges by providing spatially-explicit solutions to landscape sustainability problems. However, despite a large body of research, the real impact of landscape ecology on sustainable landscape management and planning is still limited. In this paper, we first outline a typology of landscape sustainability problems which serves to guide landscape ecologists in the problem-solving process. We then outline a formal problem-solving approach, whereby landscape ecologists can better bring about disciplinary integration, a consideration of multiple landscape functions over long time scales, and a focus on decision making. This framework explicitly considers multiple ecological objectives and socio-economic constraints, the spatial allocation of scarce resources to address these objectives, and the timing of the implementation of management actions. It aims to make explicit the problem-solving objectives, management options and the system understanding required to make sustainable landscape planning decisions. We propose that by adopting a more problem-solving approach, landscape ecologists can make a significant contribution towards realising sustainable future landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Cowpea is one of the most important food legume crops in Burkina Faso. It is able to associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and rhizobia. This dual symbiosis improves nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient uptake in cowpea. As the application of exotic inoculants frequently lacks positive responses in field experiments, this study set out to select well-adapted native symbiotic rhizobial and AMF strains. Soil samples were collected from six study sites in three different climatic zones of Burkina Faso to investigate their native symbiotic strains. Soil-extraction of native spores led to the identification of four AMF genera (Scutellospora, Gigaspora, Glomus and Entrophospora) by morpho-anatomical characterization. The two most effective cowpea fungal strains were selected after spore isolation from field-collected soils, multiplication on maize roots and inoculation on cowpea seedlings in a greenhouse experiment. Cowpea-nodulating rhizobial strains were trapped in the greenhouse by planting cowpea seeds in collected soil samples and the strains were characterized using molecular methods. This characterization led to the rhizobial isolates being classified in four clusters on the phylogenetic tree (using the Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenies method). All strains belonged to the Bradyrhizobium genus and most of them were included in the B. japonicum branch. Some groups were clearly distinct species already identified and may be new species. The two most effective strains for cowpea yield improvement in the field were selected after cowpea inoculation in a greenhouse experiment. The inoculation design in the field experiment consisted of four single inoculation treatments, either rhizobial or mycorrhizal, along with four dual inoculations, one treatment with chemical fertilizers, and one uninoculated control. The results showed that cowpea productivity was significatively improved by dual inoculation with native rhizobial and mycorrhizal strains, reaching the same level as the application of commonly used chemical fertilizers [Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium fertilizers (NPK)]. In addition, dual inoculation resulted in the highest iron content in cowpea leaves.'

Abstract: 'The participation of nurses and midwives in vaginal birth care is limited in Brazil, and there are no national data regarding their involvement. The goal was to describe the participation of nurses and nurse-midwives in childbirth care in Brazil in the years 2011 and 2012, and to analyze the association between hospitals with nurses and nurse-midwives in labor and birth care and the use of good practices, and their influence in the reduction of unnecessary interventions, including cesarean sections.'

Abstract: 'The increasing intensity and frequency of human disasters is often related to ecological mismanagement and especially to that of vegetation through unwise clearing, burning and overgrazing. Corrective measures are generally feasible by instituting sound management but this must be based on good planning and be supported by adequate finance and a willingness to meet the social cost.'

Abstract: 'Genetic variation within and between five populations of Oryza granulata from two regions of China was investigated using RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) and ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat amplification) markers. Twenty RAPD primers used in this study amplified 199 reproducible bands with 61 (30.65%) polymorphic; and 12 ISSR primers amplified 113 bands with 52 (46.02%) polymorphic. Both RAPD and ISSR analyses revealed a low level of genetic diversity in wild populations of O. granulata. Furthermore, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was used to apportion the variation within and between populations both within and between regions. As the RAPD markers revealed, 73.85% of the total genetic diversity resided between the two regions, whereas only 19.45% and 6.70% were present between populations within regions and within a population respectively. Similarly, it was shown by ISSR markers that a great amount of variation (49.26%) occurred between the two regions, with only 38.07% and 12.66% between populations within regions and within a population respectively. Both the results of a UPGMA cluster, based on Jaccard coefficients, and pairwise distance analysis agree with that of the AMOVA partition. This is the first report of the partitioning of genetic variability within and among populations of O. granulata at the DNA level, which is in general agreement with a recent study on the same species in China using allozyme analysis. Our results also indicated that the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) detected by ISSR is higher than that detected by RAPD. It seems that ISSR is superior to RAPD in terms of the polymorphism detected and the amplification reproducibility.'

Abstract: 'Lake Towuti (2.5\xc2\xb0S, 121.5\xc2\xb0E) is a long-lived, tectonic lake located on the Island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, and in the center of the Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP). Lake Towuti is connected with upstream lakes Matano and Mahalona through the Mahalona River, which constitutes the largest inlet to the lake. The Mahalona River Delta is prograding into Lake Towuti\xe2\x80\x99s deep northern basin thus exerting significant control on depositional processes in the basin. We combine high-resolution seismic reflection and sedimentological datasets from a 19.8-m-long sediment piston core from the distal edge of this delta to characterize fluctuations in deltaic sedimentation during the past ~29\xc2\xa0kyr BP and their relation to climatic change. Our datasets reveal that, in the present, sedimentation is strongly influenced by deposition of laterally transported sediments sourced from the Mahalona River Delta. Variations in the amount of laterally transported sediments, as expressed by coarse fraction amounts in pelagic muds and turbidite recurrence rates and cumulative thicknesses, are primarily a function of lake-level induced delta slope instability and delta progradation into the basin. We infer lowest lake-levels between ~29 and 16, a gradual lake level rise between ~16 and 11, and high lake-levels between ~11 and 0\xc2\xa0kyr BP. Periods of highest turbidite deposition, ~26 to 24 and ~18 to 16\xc2\xa0kyr BP coincide with Heinrich events 2 and 1, respectively. Our lake-level reconstruction therefore supports previous observations based on geochemical hydroclimate proxies of a very dry last glacial and a wet Holocene in the region, and provides new evidence of millennial-scale variations in moisture balance in the IPWP.'

Abstract: 'We gathered the available information about the anurofauna in Brazilian sand coastal plains (\xe2\x80\x9crestingas\xe2\x80\x9d) published since the 1966, which is the date of the first study we found that was conducted exclusively about anurans in these ecosystems. We made a compilation of available data found in publications and sought to finding a pattern on anuran communities of Brazilian sandy coastal plains. We found 63 published studies about anurans in remaining restingas along the Brazilian coast. We record the occurrence of 14,010 individuals, comprised of 145 amphibian species from 12 families. The species were distributed latitudinally in a peculiar way, and here, we discuss this distribution regarding the characteristics of the species. Our results showed that the available existing base still does not allow us to define the structural patterns of the anuran communities in sandy coastal plains in Brazil. The relative lack of studies about the anurofauna in \xe2\x80\x9crestingas\xe2\x80\x9d and the high rate of degradation are negative factors that can cause extinctions in these environments even before we understand the patterns and processes that act on anuran communities in restinga environments.'

Abstract: 'India is very important but relatively unexplored region in terms of carbon studies, where significant environmental changes have occurred in the 20th century that can alter terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP). Here, we used a process-based, Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), driven by land cover and land use change (LCLUC), climate\xc2\xa0change, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, atmospheric nitrogen deposition (NDEP), and tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution to estimate terrestrial NPP in India during 1901\xe2\x80\x932010. Over the country, terrestrial NPP showed significant inter-annual variations ranging 1.2 Pg C year\xe2\x88\x921 to 1.7 Pg C year\xe2\x88\x921 during the 1901\xe2\x80\x932010. Overall, multiple environmental changes have increased terrestrial NPP by 0.23 Pg C year\xe2\x88\x921. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased NPP by 0.29 Pg C; however climate change has offset a portion of terrestrial NPP (0.11 Pg C) during this study period. On an average, terrestrial NPP reduced by 0.12 Pg C year\xe2\x88\x921 in drought years; when precipitation was 100\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 lower than long term average, suggesting that terrestrial carbon cycle in India is strongly linked to climate\xc2\xa0change. LCLUC, including land conversions and cropland management\xc2\xa0practices, increased terrestrial NPP by 0.043 Pg C year\xe2\x88\x921 over the country. Tropospheric O3 pollution reduced terrestrial NPP by 0.06 Pg C year\xe2\x88\x921 and the decrease was comparatively higher in croplands than other biomes after the 1980s. Our results have shown that climate change and tropospheric O3 pollution may partially offset terrestrial NPP increase\xc2\xa0caused by elevated CO2 concentration, LCLUC, and NDEP over India.'

Abstract: "Fish distribution in a river within the drainage system of Zaire headwaters and with an unusual gradient was studied. The Luongo River has high gradient upper and lower sections, separated by a long middle section of no gradients, and bordered by rapids and waterfalls. On the basis of Luongo's hydrographic history, topography and fish taxocenes the river is divided into saltatory zones, each zone inhabited by separate homeostatic fish communities. The problem of river natural zonation is argued. Luongo River is, furthermore, unique for its high richness (49 species), biogeographical correlations, and the number of undescribed species found (14%), of which one,Chetia mola, is described in this study. The probable reasons for the richness and for the discontinuous fish assemblages are discussed."

Abstract: 'Humans have altered the environment so severely that extinction events are now occurring at rates unprecedented in modern history. In order to slow this trend, conservation actions must be taken to protect biodiversity, beyond just saving flagship species. Some governmental and conservation organizations have responded by committing to ecosystem conservation but, as yet, there is no coherent strategy for how this can be carried out. This report introduces many of the theoretical aspects that will need to be considered for the development of a coherent ecosystem conservation policy. The approach includes analyzing a hierarchy of interaction-based local coexistence mechanisms within a regional and historical context. This approach points toward the need for prioritizing sensitive habitats using local interaction models; considering the effects of historical exploitation mechanisms, which are now often missing; and evaluating regional diversity influences further to identify circumstances where system-wide habitat improvements deserve more emphasis.'

Abstract: 'The political geographical literature of focuses on the State yet little attention has been placed on the basic criteria and attributes of statehood. This paper presents a linked politico-geographic and legal perspective on statehood. The criteria and attributes identified and discussed are: a particular defined territory; a permanent resident population; a constituted effective government; independence; sovereignty; recognition; permanence; the capacity to enter into relations with other States; a State apparatus; a circulation system; and an organized economy. Certain conceptualizations and the importance of discourse are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Chapada das Mesas National Park extends \nover an area of 160,046\xc2\xa0ha in the municipalities of Carolina, Riach\xc3\xa3o, Estreito and Imperatriz in the south central region of the state of Maranh\xc3\xa3o, northeast Brazil, in a savanna-like biome known as the Cerrado. The park has a rich biodiversity, making the need for conservation all the more important. The weather conditions in the region increase the likelihood of wildfires, so that a monitoring and control system for the area is needed to help conservation efforts. This article proposes a methodology that uses data-mining techniques to predict outbreaks of wildfires in the park some hours in advance. Predictive models using wildfire records and a meteorology dataset for 11\xc2\xa0months in 2010 were built. Two different classification techniques for predicting wildfires were used: artificial neural networks and classification rules. The two models built with these techniques showed good accuracy when tested with the validation samples and could be used as additional tools for predicting the risk of fires in the area.'

Abstract: 'In recent years, the sensor array has attracted much attention in the field of complex system analysis on the basis of its good selectivity and easy operation. Many optical colorimetric sensor arrays are designed to analyze multi-target analytes due to the good sensitivity of optical signal. In this review, we introduce the targeting analytes, sensing mechanisms and data processing methods of the optical colorimetric sensor array based on optical probes (including organic molecular probes, polymer materials and nanomaterials). The research progress in the detection of metal ions, anions, toxic gases, organic compounds, biomolecules and living organisms (such as DNA, amino acids, proteins, microbes and cells) and actual sample mixtures are summarized here. The review illustrates the types, application advantages and development prospects of the optical colorimetric sensor array to help broad readers to understand the research progress in the application of chemical sensor array.'

Abstract: 'The micrometeorological technique of eddy covariance is a powerful tool for characterizing the carbon (C) budget of terrestrial ecosystems. Eddy covariance method was used for estimating Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide between atmosphere and revegetated manganese mine spoil dump at Gumgaon, India. In this paper, we analyzed the diel CO2 flux pattern and its response to various physical environmental conditions. The carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems is particularly sensitive to climatic changes. Study of diel pattern of CO2 flux showed that carbon uptake was dependent on sunlight. Effect of temperature and latent heat on the CO2 flux showed that rate of CO2 uptake increased proportionally, but later declined due to various factors like stomatal response, high evaporative demand, circadian rhythm and/or a combination of all three. Net ecosystem production of revegetated land was found to be 28.196\xc2\xa0KgC/ha/day whereas average net carbon release by the ecosystem, through respiration was observed to be 5.433\xc2\xa0KgC/ha/day. Thus, quantifying net carbon (C) storage in degraded land is a necessary step in the validation of carbon sequestration estimates and in assessing the possible role of these ecosystems in offsetting adverse impacts of fossil fuel emissions.'

Abstract: 'Kerinci is a densely populated valley surrounded by a national park in western central Sumatra, Indonesia. Indigenous agroforestry systems include important cash crops like coffee (Coffea canephora var.robusta) and cinnamon (Cinnamomum burmani), and range from alternate cycles of cash crop monocultures or simple associations, to multispecies and multi-storey gardens; these may include as many as 100 common useful species, comprising many fruit trees and indigenous timber species.'

Abstract: 'In order to assess the value of leaf biomass the foliar nutrient content of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Flemingia macrophylla was studied under field conditions. In total 5 series of leaf samples were collected and analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium content over a period of 42 months of growth observation. Results are compared with mean values derived from a literature study. Factors contributing to the variation observed are discussed and suggestions towards variation control are made.'

Abstract: 'Understanding what causes variability in the outcomes of common-pool resources management and governance has important policy implications for biodiversity conservation, in particular for the conservation of wild plants and animals subject to harvest. We report an exploratory study focusing on Amazonian river turtles as a common-pool resource under harvest-driven conservation and management efforts in Peru. Based on document analysis, literature review and a series of interviews, we describe the management program as a social process and identify the most important governance and management outcomes achieved (increased turtle abundance and benefits for harvesters, harvester formalization), factors hindering and facilitating the program implementation (four natural and three societal factors), and key governance actions behind the program outcomes (awareness and capacity building, crafting and enforcing rules). We then highlight the existing knowledge gaps and the needs and possible means to address particular risks related to turtle management on a harvest-driven setting.'

Abstract: 'Malaria is currently the most important human parasitic disease in the world responsible for high morbidity and mortality. Appropriate diagnostic methods are essential for early detection. Microscopy examination remains the gold standard, although molecular techniques have higher sensitivity and are very useful in cases of low parasitaemia and mixed infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate a new commercial molecular diagnostic technique.'

Abstract: 'At our Costa Rican field site, seeds defecated by frugivorous birds usually do not remain where they have been deposited. Many species of ants are attracted to frugivore defecations and remove seeds and/or pulp. Pheidole species selectively remove seeds, fungus-growing species (tribe Attini) remove both pulp and seeds. Seeds of many Melastomataceae have an appendage, which we hypothesized is an elaiosome. Indeed, preference trials demonstrated that two species of Pheidole selected seeds with the appendage over seeds of the same species in which the appendage had been removed. However, we found that these ants did not take the appendage when it was offered by itself. We conclude that the appendage is not an elaiosome. In further trials, different ant species preferentially selected different seed species. These ants consumed some seeds and deposited others unharmed in refuse piles. We conclude that because the composition of leaf-litter ant communities is highly variable between neighboring square meter plots, and the probability of seed predation depends upon the species of ant, the over-all effect of ants on seed shadows and seed banks is spatially unpredictable.'

Abstract: "Documenting the role of past interactions in the assembly of present communities has proven problematic. Colonization is a key process in community assembly that is both potentially driven by past interactions and amenable to experimental approaches. Colonization and oviposition by an aquatic beetle (Tropisternus lateralis) was assayed in the presence and absence of both 'harmless' and tactilely/visually isolated predatory fish (Lepomis gibbosus and L. macrochirus). Beetles avoided each treatment with fish when compared to fish-free experimental pools. Activity levels after colonization also differed significantly between adults in fish and fish-free tanks. Predator effects on species composition are typically ascribed to contemporary predation events; the presence of a strong avoidance response demonstrates that past species interactions affect present distributions and may play an important role in the ongoing assembly of contemporary communities. Documentation of such avoidance behavior in a growing number of species fundamentally alters our view of the processes affecting species distributions and the process of community assembly."

Abstract: 'About 50 species in more than 20 genera of the microdrile oligochaete families Tubificidae, Naididae, Opistocystidae, and Enchytraeidae and the freshwater megadrile families Sparganophilidae and Alluroididae were identified in recent collections made in Guyana. Only seven species in these families were previously recorded from Guyana. The aquatic oligochaete fauna has similar components to those of the southeastern United States, other locations in South America, and across lower latitudes in the northern hemisphere. A high diversity of species is found in the naidids especially in the genera Pristina and Pristinella, especially considering the small number of locations that have been sampled. The collections include approximately 12 new species of rhyacodrilines (Tubificidae), Dero, Pristina, Pristinella (Naididae), Brinkhurstia (Alluroididae), Hemienchytraeus and Aspidodrilus (Enchytraeidae). This is the first record of Aspidodrilus from outside of Africa and the first new record since 1952.'

Abstract: 'We examined the effects of treefall gap size and soil properties on microbial biomass dynamics in an undisturbed mature-phase humid subtropical broadleaved forest in north-east India. Canopy gaps had low soil moisture and low microbial biomass suggesting that belowground dynamics accompanied changes in light resources after canopy opening. High rainfall in the region causes excessive erosion/leaching of top soil and eventually soil fertility declines in treefall gaps compared to understorey. Soil microbial population was less during periods when temperature and moisture conditions are low, while it peaked during rainy season when the litter decomposition rate is at its peak on the forest floor. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season (the peak vegetative growth period) limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and, therefore, low microbial C, N and P. Weak correlations were also obtained for the relationships between microbial C, N and P and soil physico\xe2\x80\x93chemical properties. Gap size did influence the microbial nutrients and their contribution to soil organic carbon, total Kjeldhal nitrogen and available-P. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic carbon, microbial N to total nitrogen were similar in both treefall gaps and understorey plots, while the contribution of microbial P to soil available-P was lower in gap compared to the understorey. These results indicate that any fluctuation in microbial biomass related nutrient cycling processes in conjunction with the associated microclimate variation may affect the pattern of regeneration of tree seedlings in the gaps and hence be related with their size.'

Abstract: 'Freshwater basins are vulnerable to human-induced change for a number of reasons. They lie at the bottoms of catchments and therefore are subject to the run-off of a large variety of dissolved and particulate substances; shallow basins provide fertile agricultural soils if drained; and public perception, particularly of wetland basins, is of inhospitable places, so that lobbies for drainage are more likely to be effective than those seeking to preserve the habitat. On the other hand, water is so important to human life that there is also strong concern about the fate of freshwater habitats. Freshwater systems are also often open systems capable of faster recovery from disturbance than their terrestrial counterparts.'

Abstract: 'In this paper we explore the interpretation of quantity expressions in Yudja, an indigenous language spoken in the Amazonian basin, showing that while the language allows reference to exact cardinalities, it does not generally allow reference to exact measure values. It does, however, allow non-exact comparison along continuous dimensions. We use this data to argue that the grammar of exact measurement is distinct from a grammar allowing the expression of exact cardinalities, and that the grammar of counting and the grammar of measurement may use numerals with different, though related interpretations. As Yudja shows, the language of measurement is not automatically acquired along with the knowledge of exact numeral expressions. We show that the \xe2\x80\x98gap\xe2\x80\x99 between prelinguistic intuitions about quantity in terms of numerosity and counting, which is bridged by the learning of language expressing exact cardinality, is paralleled by a similar gap between prelinguistic intuitions about quantity on a continuous dimension and measuring: this gap too must be bridged by language which expresses exact measure values. Our results suggest that the enculturation process by which we develop skills to perform abstract operations in the domain of measurement is (1) language dependent and (2) distinct from the process by which we learn to perform abstract calculations in the cardinal domain.'

Abstract: 'Gene-environment (GxE) interactions likely contribute to numerous diseases, but are often difficult to model in the laboratory. Such interactions have been widely hypothesized for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); recent controlled laboratory studies are discussed here and hypotheses related to possible mechanisms of action are offered. Using methylmercury exposure and mutated SOD1 to model the impacts of such an interaction, we interpret evidence about their respective mechanisms of toxicity to interrogate the possibility of additive (or synergistic) effects when combined.'

Abstract: "Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to biodiversity conservation in the Atlantic Forest. A network of protected reserves is essential to the protection of native fauna and flora. However, internal and external factors may threaten the preservation of biota, thus population viability analyses (PVA) are important tools in reserve design and management planning. A PVA was carried out, using the computer package VORTEX, to assess the effectiveness of the reserve network of Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil in retaining viable populations of the endemic marsupial Micoureus travassosi. The PVA takes into account demographic, genetic and environmental stochastic events and catastrophes (fire). Rio de Janeiro state has 31 reserves, and 20 of those were considered to retain viable populations for 100 years, whereas eight were predicted to suffer from genetic decay, two from both genetic decay and demographic stochasticity, and one of them probably has an extinct population. The minimum area of suitable habitat needed to maintain a minimum viable population of M. travassosi is estimated at 3600\xe2\x80\x89ha. Sensitivity analysis was run for mortality, sex ratio, percentage of reproductive females, inbreeding depression and probability of catastrophes, and suggests that inbreeding depression is important in small population sizes, whereas the effects of catastrophes were significant only for large populations. Although the model indicates that some populations will suffer from demographic and/or genetic stochasticity, the reserve network of Rio de Janeiro state will likely keep M. travassosi's populations for the next 100 years."

Abstract: 'The parasite prevalence and infection intensity in primate wild populations can be affected by many variables linked to host and/or parasite ecology or either to interparasite competition/mutualism. In this study, we tested how host sex, age, and place of origin, as well parasitic concomitant infections affect the structure of golden lion and golden-headed lion tamarins parasite community, considering Trypanosoma cruzi and intestinal helminths infection in these primates. A total of 206 tamarins from two Atlantic Coastal rain forest areas in Brazil were tested during 4\xc2\xa0years for prevalence of T. cruzi infection and helminth prevalence. Three intestinal helminth groups showed high prevalences in both tamarin species: Prosthenorchis sp., Spiruridae, and Trichostrongylidae. An association between presence of T. cruzi infection and higher intestinal helminth prevalence was found in both tamarin species. Two explanations for this association seem to be plausible: (1) lower helminth-linked mortality rates in T. cruzi-infected tamarins and (2) lower elimination rates of helminths in such tamarins. A higher frequency of T. cruzi-positive blood cultures was significantly correlated to female tamarins and to the presence of Trichostrongylidae infection. The possibility of an increase in the transmissibility of T. cruzi and the three analyzed helminths in lion tamarins with concomitant infections is discussed.'

Abstract: 'Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) NON-EXPRESSOR OF PR1 (NPR1) is a transcription coactivator that plays a central role in regulating the transcriptional response to plant pathogens. Developing flowers of homozygous npr3 mutants are dramatically more resistant to infection by the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, suggesting a role of NPR3 as a repressor of NPR1-mediated defense response with a novel role in flower development.'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to establish a subsampling procedure for benthic macroinvertebrates to aid in the development of a multimetric index to assess the biological condition of streams. Data from six streams that are considered minimally impaired were used. Subsampling was done using a device divided into 24 quadrats. The sediment from each quadrat was sorted, and all organisms were removed and identified. Richness metrics were the most affected by subsample size. Relative-abundance metrics were the most stable, proving that the sample was well distributed throughout the tray and abundance proportions were maintained. The results showed that the macroinvertebrate assemblage present in the six quadrats was similar to that present in the full sample. These analyses indicated that six quadrats, randomly designated, with a minimum of 200 collected specimens could be used in place of the full sample. In routine water management, managing time and costs are a major challenge; therefore, this type of simplification is absolutely necessary to ensure that a biomonitoring tool is useful for practical applications.'

Abstract: 'In Peninsular Malaysia ten species of lycaenid butterflies use leaf flushes or inflorescences of the legume tree Saraca thaipingensis as larval hostplant. Resource partitioning among these species is regulated by a complex mixture of patterns of interaction with ants. Females of obligately myrmecophilous species lay their eggs exclusively on trees colonized by their specific host ants. On trees colonized by weaver ants, only specialist mutualists adapted to these territorial ants are able to survive, while larvae of other species are killed. The formicine ant Cladomyrma petalae, which inhabits hollow twigs of the myrmecophytic hostplant, likewise precludes oviposition by female butterflies. Lycaenid larvae confronted with this ant species never survive, but one concealed feeding species (Jamides caeruleus) escapes removal due to the cryptic life-habits of the larvae. Two facultative myrmecophiles associate in a mutualistic way with a wide and largely overlapping range of ant genera which forage at the extrafloral nectaries of leaf flushes. One species (Cheritra freja) is not myrmecophilous, but is tolerated by all but the most territorial ants. Ant-dependent hostplant selection and egg-clustering characterize the obligate mutualists, whereas facultative myrmecophiles and the non-myrmecophile distribute their eggs singly over appropriate hostplants. Signals mediating caterpillar-ant communication are highly specialized in one obligate myrmecophile (Drupadia theda), but rather unspecific in four other species tested. Altogether our observations indicate that colonization and establishment of lycaenid butterflies on S. thaipingensis trees are governed by specializations as well as opportunistic use of resources (ants and hostplant parts). Therefore, the diversity of this species assemblage is maintained by deterministic as well as stochastic factors.'

Abstract: 'To our best knowledge, any study related to the ecological distribution of Cryptococcus neoformans in Jordan does not exist in the medical literature. In order to determine the environmental occurrence of both varieties of Cryptococcus neoformans in Jordan, pigeon droppings and material under the canopies of eucalyptus trees were collected from four major cities of this country. For the isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans variety gattii from environmental sources, 500 samples of the mixed soil debris, including tree materials, under the eucalyptus trees from cities of Amman, Irbid, Jerash, and Ajlun were collected. Also, 509 samples of pigeon droppings were collected from the same cities for the isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans variety neoformans. After inoculating the samples onto modified Staib agar medium in Petri dishes, a total of 336 melanoid yeast colonies were picked up during screening process. At the end of serial mycological studies, none of these isolates was identified as Cryptococcus neoformans, but all were Cryptococcus species other than C. neoformans. For determining the exact status, more extensive environmental studies need to be done in the future.'

Abstract: 'Prevention or cure of different illnesses through the use of plant latex is a worldwide known concept. The antifungal activity of Hancornia speciosa latex has been observed against Candida albicans. However, H. speciosa latex is not a sterile plant exudate and secondary metabolites produced by bacteria could be involved in fungal inhibition. In the present study, the bacterial communities of the latex from three H. speciosa trees were characterized using traditional plating and molecular methods. Twelve strains isolated from the latex samples were clustered into four groups by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). One representative of each group was sequenced and they were identified as belonging to the genera Bacillus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Escherichia. None of the 12 isolates showed antifungal activity against C. albicans. A lack of a microbial origin for the antifungal properties of latex was noted. DGGE profiles generated from each of the three latex samples showed unique patterns. Sequencing of the DGGE bands demonstrated the affiliation with the genera Klebsiella, Pantoea, Enterobacter and Burkholderia. In addition, clone libraries were generated and the phylogenetic distribution of the 50 analyzed clones was similar to that obtained using DGGE. The presence of some potential pathogens should be considered before using H. speciosa latex in folk medicine.'

Abstract: 'The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a widely used non-invasive method for monitoring the brain. It is based upon placing conductive electrodes on the scalp which measure the small electrical potentials that arise outside of the head due to neuronal action within the brain. Historically this has been a large and bulky technology, restricted to the monitoring of subjects in a lab or clinic while they are stationary. Over the last decade much research effort has been put into the creation of \xe2\x80\x9cwearable EEG\xe2\x80\x9d which overcomes these limitations and allows the long term non-invasive recording of brain signals while people are out of the lab and moving about. This paper reviews the recent progress in this field, with particular emphasis on the electrodes used to make connections to the head and the physical EEG hardware. The emergence of conformal \xe2\x80\x9ctattoo\xe2\x80\x9d type EEG electrodes is highlighted as a key next step for giving very small and socially discrete units. In addition, new recommendations for the performance validation of novel electrode technologies are given, with standards in this area seen as the current main bottleneck to the wider take up of wearable EEG. The paper concludes by considering the next steps in the creation of next generation wearable EEG units, showing that a wide range of research avenues are present.'

Abstract: 'Focusing on the Philippines, the article describes the role played by people\'s movements and non-governmental organizations in empowering citizens and combating injustice. Educational programmes are an important element in this struggle. The authors cite examples of what Paolo Freire called the "pedagogy of dialogue", which seeks to develop creative, critical enquiry and self-reliant understanding. Such programmes have made an impact in areas such as women\'s empowerment, poverty-alleviation and the combating of environmental destruction. The authors argue that this type of education can also play an important role in challenging the materialist vision of progress and awakening people to deeper values.'

Abstract: ' Although the processes governing photosynthesis are well understood, scaling from shoot to canopy in coniferous forests is complex. Development of different sap-flow techniques has made it possible to measure transpiration of whole trees and thereby also of whole canopies. There is a strong link between photosynthesis and transpiration, for which reason it would be interesting to test whether measurements of canopy transpiration could also be used to estimate canopy photosynthesis. As a first step towards this, water-use efficiency (WUE) was studied at branch and canopy scales on the basis of branch gas-exchange measurements, with half-hourly and daily temporal resolution. Half-hourly and daily WUE at both branch and canopy scales showed a strong dependency on vapour-pressure deficit (\xce\xb4e). Branch photosynthesis modelled from branch transpiration and \xce\xb4e mimicked well measured branch photosynthesis. Also, modelled photosynthesis, scaled to canopy and compared to net forest CO2 exchange measured by the eddy-covariance technique, occasionally showed good agreement. In spite of these seemingly promising results, there was a difference in the response to \xce\xb4e between branches and between years, which needs to be better understood.'

Abstract: 'Using data from eddy covariance measurements in a subtropical coniferous forest, a test and evaluation have been made for the model of Carbon Exchange in the Vegetation-Soil-Atmosphere (CEVSA) that simulates energy transfers and water, carbon and nitrogen cycles based on ecophysiological processes. In the present study, improvement was made in the model in calculating LAI, carbon allocation among plant organs, litter fall, decomposition and evapotranspiration. The simulated seasonal variations in carbon and water vapor flux were consistent with the measurements. The model explained 90% and 86% of the measured variations in evapotranspiration and soil water content. However, the modeled evapotranspiration and soil water content were lower than the measured systematically, because the model assumed that water was lost as runoff if it was beyond the soil saturation water content, but the soil at the flux site with abundant rainfall is often above water saturated. The improved model reproduced 79% and 88% of the measured variations in gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R e), but only 31% of the variations in measured net ecosystem exchange (NEP) despite the fact that the modeled annual NEP was close to the observation. The modeled NEP was generally lower in winter and higher in summer than the observations. The simulated responses of photosynthesis and respiration to water vapor deficit at high temperatures were different from measurements. The results suggested that the improved model underestimated ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration in extremely condition. The present study shows that CEVSA can simulate the seasonal pattern and magnitude of CO2 and water vapor fluxes, but further improvement in simulating photosynthesis and respiration at extreme temperatures and water deficit is required.'

Abstract: 'Using global terrestrial ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) data, we validated the simulated multi-model ensemble (MME) NPP, analyzed the spatial distribution of global NPP and explored the relationship between NPP and climate variations in historical scenarios of 10 CMIP5 models. The results show that the global spatial pattern of simulated terrestrial ecosystem NPP, is consistent with IGBP NPP, but the values have some differences and there is a huge uncertainty. Considering global climate change, near surface temperature is the major factor affecting the terrestrial ecosystem, followed by the precipitation. This means terrestrial ecosystem NPP is more closely related to near surface temperature than precipitation. Between 1976 and 2005, NPP shows an obvious increasing temporal trend, indicating the terrestrial ecosystem has had a positive response to climate change. MME NPP has increased 3.647PgC during historical period, which shows an increasing temporal trend of 3.9 gCm\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x99100 yr\xe2\x88\x922 in the past 150 years, also indicating that the terrestrial ecosystem has shown a positive response to climate change in past 150 years.'

Abstract: 'The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex causes tuberculosis in humans and nonhuman primates and is a global public health concern. Standard diagnostics rely upon host immune responses to detect infection in nonhuman primates and lack sensitivity and specificity across the spectrum of mycobacterial infection in these species. We have previously shown that the Oral Swab PCR (OSP) assay, a direct pathogen detection method, can identify the presence of M. tuberculosis complex in laboratory and free-ranging Old World monkeys. Addressing the current limitations in tuberculosis diagnostics in primates, including sample acquisition and pathogen detection, this paper furthers our understanding of the presence of the tuberculosis-causing bacteria among New World monkeys in close contact with humans. Here we use the minimally invasive OSP assay, which includes buccal swab collection followed by amplification of the IS6110 repetitive nucleic acid sequence specific to M. tuberculosis complex subspecies, to detect the bacteria in the mouths of Peruvian New World monkeys. A total of 220 buccal swabs from 16 species were obtained and positive amplification of the IS6110 sequence was observed in 30 (13.6%) of the samples. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of M. tuberculosis complex DNA in a diverse sample of Peruvian Neotropical primates.'

Abstract: 'Brazil is one of the largest bioethanol and biodiesel producers in the world. Its biodiversity and environmental characteristics create the opportunity to make Brazil a major producer of biotechnological products, such as enzymes for the bioenergy industry. This review gives a brief status of the production of amylases, cellulases, xylanases, and lipases and their application on the synthesis of bioethanol and biodiesel. The historical utilization of several agroindustrial by-products as feedstocks in such processes are presented, as well as the Brazilian market for these enzymes. Finally, an innovative and multidisciplinary approach based on geographic information systems is used in a case study for the estimation of the potential production of the biocatalysts in Brazil. Results indicate that the national production of concentrated preparations based on amylases, cellulases, lipases, and xylanases could reach 3.1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89107, 3.2\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89107, 3.1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89108, and 2.9\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89109\xc2\xa0t, respectively. Therefore, Brazil presents a huge potential for the production of biocatalysts from renewable materials.'

Abstract: 'The important message contained in Garrett Hardin\'s seminalScience article, "The Tragedy of the Commons," is that in making resource-use decisions individuals see their own narrow interests best and, if not constrained by institutions such as governmental rule or market incentives, will tend to follow those narrow interests. Individuals do not automatically seek to use resources in the long-run best interests of society. This fact of life leads to abuse of resources to which access is not controlled.'

Abstract: 'Polymorphisms within the PfATP6 gene have been indicated as potential molecular markers for artemisinin efficacy. Since 2004, the use of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) was introduced as first-line treatment of the uncomplicated malaria cases in Suriname. The aim of this research was to determine changes in Suriname in the status of the polymorphic markers in the PfATP6 gene before and after the adoption of the ACT-regimen, particularly of the S769N mutation, which was reported to be associated with in vitro Artemether resistance in the neighboring country French Guiana.'

Abstract: 'Particle hygroscopicity plays a key role in understanding the mechanisms of haze formation and particle optical properties. The present study developed a method for predicting the effective hygroscopic parameter \xc4\xb8 and the water content of PM2.5 on the basis of the \xc4\xb8-K\xc3\xb6hler theory and bulk chemical components of PM2.5. Our study demonstrated that the effective hygroscopic parameter can be estimated using the PM2.5 mass concentration, water-soluble ions, and total water-soluble carbon. By combining the estimated \xc4\xb8 and ambient relative humidity, the water content of PM2.5 can be further estimated. As an example, the \xc4\xb8 and water content of PM2.5 in Beijing were estimated utilizing the method proposed in this study. The annual average value of \xc4\xb8 of PM2.5 in Beijing was 0.25\xc2\xb10.09, the maximum \xc4\xb8 value 0.26\xc2\xb10.08 appeared in summer, and the seasonal variation is insignificant. The PM2.5 water content was determined by both the PM2.5 hygroscopicity and the ambient relative humidity (RH). The annual average mass ratio of water content and PM2.5 was 0.18\xc2\xb10.20, and the maximum value 0.31\xc2\xb10.25 appeared in summer. Based on the estimated water content of PM2.5 in Beijing, the relationship between the PM2.5 water content and RH was parameterized as: m (%) = 0.03 \xc3\x97 (5.73\xc3\x9710-8) \xc3\x97 RH3.72. This parametric formula helps to characterize the relationship between the PM2.5 mass concentration and atmospheric visibility.'

Abstract: 'The dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems depends on interactions between carbon, nutrient and hydrological cycles. Terrestrial ecosystems retain carbon in live biomass (aboveground and belowground), decomposing organic matter, and soil. Carbon is exchanged naturally between these systems and the atmosphere through photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and combustion. Human activities change carbon stock in these pools and exchanges between them and the atmosphere through land-use, land-use change, and forestry.'

Abstract: 'China\xe2\x80\x99s overseas activities during the first decade of the 21st century were characterized by state-directed investments, while the Brazilian government was often portrayed as lacking a strategic policy toward the emerging Asian power. Times have changed. In recent years China\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s mineral sector have become more fragmented, while Brazilian subnational entities have assumed greater prominence in directing transnational investment flows. Based on research in both countries between 2011 and 2014, this article presents three developments that help explain the changing scales of China-Brazil mining relations.'

Abstract: 'A key challenge in the study of inter-specific cooperation, or mutualisms, is to understand the mechanisms that prevent cheating. However, many mutualisms are still invaded by parasites, and we propose that plant \xe2\x80\x98tolerance strategies\xe2\x80\x99, which allow an individual to re-grow and/or reproduce after damage, might have evolved to recover some of the fitness lost to parasitism. We focus on the ant plant Cordia nodosa and its protecting ant symbionts Allomerus octoarticulatus and Azteca spp. Allomerus is a castration parasite, destroying host flowers. However, some flowers are produced on new branch shoots, where they escape castration. Here, we ask whether C. nodosa tolerates castration by directing floral growth to new shoots. We find that C. nodosa produces four times more floral buds on the new shoots of Allomerus-inhabited plants, compared to Azteca-inhabited plants. Additionally, on Allomerus-inhabited plants, the production of floral buds is three times greater on new than on mature shoots, and more floral buds are grown on plants with new shoots than on those without. We conclude therefore that C. nodosa tolerates castration by re-allocating floral resources to new shoots. We also test whether tolerance exploits behavioural differences between the brood-tending \xe2\x80\x98nurse\xe2\x80\x99 ant worker caste, which is active on mature shoots, and the new shoot-protecting \xe2\x80\x98patroller\xe2\x80\x99 caste. Behavioural assay experiments reveal that nurse ants are strongly attracted to extracts of flowers, whereas patrollers are not, suggesting that nurses are the primary castrating caste. Thus, producing flowers on new shoots avoids the castrating caste. We finish by proposing that tolerance strategies can promote the evolution and maintenance of mutualism.'

Abstract: 'Literatures on sustainability have developed dramatically over recent decades. These literatures have not only added an enormous number of dimensions, but also have challenged researchers to be able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sustainability. The excessive use of natural capital (NC) might cause a decrease in sustainability. Depleting a type of NC and substituting it with another form of NC or with produced capital is not sustainable in the strong sense. In this review, we have focused on the importance of NC and ecosystem preservations for sustainable development. We value the NC of 140 nations by adopting the inclusive wealth approach. We also notice the impact of climate change and natural disaster on different geographic regions in the assessment of NC.'

Abstract: 'The Atlantic Forest suffered five centuries of continuous deforestation related to successive economic cycles, and is now reduced to 11.7\xc2\xa0% of its original cover. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact was launched in 2009 and aims to restore 15 million hectares until 2050. Natural regeneration can play an important role in meeting this target, however little attention has been paid to this process and there is a gap in the knowledge about its driving factors at the landscape scale. We mapped forest cover of an Atlantic Forest municipality in Southeastern Brazil, in five timeslots between years 1978 and 2014, and used the weights of evidence method for modeling its spatial dynamics, in order to understand where natural regeneration is occurring and which are the main factors related to this phenomenon. In 36\xc2\xa0years, forest cover increased 3,020 hectares (15.3\xc2\xa0%), related to the decreasing of both rural population (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.9794, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.0013) and cropland cover (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.8679, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.0212). Landscape metrics shows the increment of number of fragments and structural connectivity among them. The main spatial variables influencing forest cover dynamics were topographic position, slope, solar radiation, soil type and distance to forest, urban areas and roads. Secondary forests provide ecosystem services that can turn into economic benefits, and natural regeneration can reduce restoration costs to the municipality. The cost of active restoration of the same area would have meant a total expense of U$ 15.1 million (U$ 419\xc2\xa0k/year). We show here that spontaneous regeneration must be accounted for and incorporated into the spatial planning of Atlantic Forest restoration.'

Abstract: 'A program of intermittent surgical services utilized a mobile facility to support multiple primary care sites in Ecuador. The fiscal and clinical outcomes of the program were analyzed. From 1994 to 2003 the mobile program responded to requests from 15 of 22 provinces of Ecuador for surgical care. The sites served could not offer permanent surgical care. Criteria for inclusion and follow-up were set. Medical records were kept in accordance with standards of the Ministry of Health. Standards of care and critical care pathways were instituted. The program had a permanent staff supplemented by volunteers. Cases were recorded and outcomes noted with respect to complications. The cost of the surgical aspect of the program was entirely covered by a foundation through donations and public service contracts. Financial records of the foundation were reviewed and the costs analyzed. A total of 4545 operations were done largely in general surgery specialties. The program made 40 to 50 excursions each year and proved to be a stable element of medical care delivery. There were no deaths, four major complications, and three minor complications. The cost per operation was less than $100. Comparison to U.S. and international volunteer organizations are reported. This program of intermittent mobile surgical services in coordination with fixed primary care constitutes a sustainable, high quality clinical program fully integrated into existing care of a national health ministry. In-country resources may provide greatly enhanced services at low cost and should be considered as an alternative.'

Abstract: 'The aim of this review was to explore the pharmacological activity of early tracheophytes (pteridophytes) as an alternative medicine for treating human ailments. As the first vascular plants, pteridophytes (aka, ferns and fern allies) are an ancient lineage, and human beings have been exploring and using taxa from this lineage for over 2000 years because of their beneficial properties. We have documented the medicinal uses of pteridophytes belonging to thirty different families. The lycophyte Selaginella sp. was shown in earlier studies to have multiple pharmacological activity, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antidiabetic, antiviral, antimicrobial, and anti-Alzheimer properties. Among all the pteridophytes examined, taxa from the Pteridaceae, Polypodiaceae, and Adiantaceae exhibited significant medicinal activity. Based on our review, many pteridophytes have properties that could be used in alternative medicine for treatment of various human illnesses. Biotechnological tools can be used to preserve and even improve their bioactive molecules for the preparation of medicines against illness. Even though several studies have reported medicinal uses of ferns, the possible bioactive compounds of several pteridophytes have not been identified. Furthermore, their optimal dosage level and treatment strategies still need to be determined. Finally, the future direction of pteridophyte research is discussed.'

Abstract: 'The interrelationship between phenological events, climatic factors, periodicity of cambial activity and seasonal production of xylem was examined in Dillenia indica L. (Dilleniaceae) growing in sub-tropical wet forest of Meghalaya state, India. The reactivation of cambial activity was seen in the first week of May, 15 days after sprouting of new leaves and buds. The activity of cambium and xylem production gradually declined toward December and ceased from January to April end. There was correlation between leaf fall and cambial dormancy. It was evident from the correlation and regression analysis, the relationship between cambial activity, xylem production with climatic factors, the monthly mean minimum temperature plays an important role for the cambial activity and xylem production rather than influence by rainfall and relative humidity in D. indica L. The data were discussed in the light of cambial activity, xylem production and phenological events.'

Abstract: 'Petiolar, marginal, and laminar leaf glands are commonly described in Passiflora as extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). However, secretory structures at this same position in some representatives of the genus have been misidentified as EFNs, since they release exudates other than nectar. In view of the inconsistencies in the classification of EFNs in Passiflora as well as in other botanical groups, we aimed to determine whether the foliar glands in Amazonian Passiflora acuminata DC., P. glandulosa Cav., P. nitida Kunth, P. tholozanii Sacco, and P. vespertilio L., are EFNs and to investigate the plant\xe2\x80\x93insect interactions in these species by performing a survey of their visitors. Glands were evaluated by means of standard protocols in light and scanning electron microscopies. Additionally, glucostrips were applied over the profuse secretion to the presence of glucose. The glucostrip test showed positive results in all species, which enabled the classification of all glands as EFNs. Ants collecting nectar and patrolling the leaf surface belong to Ectatomma, Crematogaster, and Camponotus. Petiolar EFNs are present in P. acuminata, P. glandulosa, P. nitida, and P. tholozanii. Laminar EFNs usually described as ocelli are present only in P. vespertilio and P. glandulosa. Regardless of the morphology, the EFNs have a multiple or biseriate epidermis, a nectariferous parenchyma consisting of voluminous, thin-walled cells whose vacuoles contain dense contents, plus the occurrence of druse and a predominantly phloematic vascularization. The structure of the nectaries is consistent within Passiflora; other characteristics such as the presence of sugar in the secretion, the visitation by ants and butterflies, indicate\xc2\xa0the importance of the ecological interactions between EFNs and their visitors.'

Abstract: 'With a steadily growing population and rapid advancements in technology, the global economy is increasing in size and complexity. This growth exacerbates global vulnerabilities and may lead to unforeseen consequences such as global pandemics fueled by air travel, cyberspace attacks, and cascading failures caused by the weakest link in a supply chain. Hence, a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms driving global network vulnerabilities is urgently needed. Developing methods for efficiently monitoring evolution of the global economy is essential to such understanding. Each year the World Economic Forum publishes an authoritative report on the state of the global economy and identifies risks that are likely to be active, impactful or contagious. Using a Cascading Alternating Renewal Process approach to model the dynamics of the global risk network, we are able to answer critical questions regarding the evolution of this network. To fully trace the evolution of the network we analyze the asymptotic state of risks (risk levels which would be reached in the long term if the risks were left unabated) given a snapshot in time; this elucidates the various challenges faced by the world community at each point in time. We also investigate the influence exerted by each risk on others. Results presented here are obtained through either quantitative analysis or computational simulations.'

Abstract: 'This is a terrifically researched and very well presented book. It is a major achievement to produce a trade book based on the social and historical analysis of science that tells a wonderful, though alarming, story with wit and irony. The heart of this story is the way that industry interests, friendly scientists and conservative activists\xe2\x80\x94mainly in the US\xe2\x80\x94have over the last half century developed a strategy for generating the appearance of doubt relating to the scientific claims underwriting a series of environmental and public health reforms. The dramatic but wryly entertaining aspect of this story is that in the differing fields of smoking, acid rain, ozone depletion, nuclear winter and climate change, the same scientists and advisers manage to crop up, always trying to talk the regulations down. They devise and refine a strategy of focusing on generating the appearance of doubt, insisting on media outlets featuring \xe2\x80\x98balanced\xe2\x80\x99 coverage of the two \xe2\x80\x98sides\xe2\x80\x99, and of targeting a series of friendly mass-media outlets. Nearly everyone has noted the fit between some conservative politicians and the self-styled \xe2\x80\x98sceptics\xe2\x80\x99, but the great achievement of Oreskes and Conway is twofold: first, to have shown how often it is the same core of doubt-mongers (usually including Fred Seitz and S. Fred Singer) who are present almost irrespective of the specific scientific issue, and second, to have troubled to read all the contentious material and to show how often the sceptics\xe2\x80\x99 arguments are based on wilful misunderstanding, tendentious interpretation and unsubstantiated assertion.'

Abstract: ' We compiled 2,458 biomass equations from 168 destructive sampling studies in Indonesia. Unpublished academic theses contributed the largest share of the biomass equations. The availability of the biomass equations was skewed to certain regions, forest types, and species.

Abstract: " Many plant species have evolved mutualistic associations with ants, protecting their host against detrimental influences such as herbivorous insects. Letourneau (1998) reported in the case of Piper that ants defend their plants principally against stem-boring insects and also reduce fungal infections on inflorescences. Macaranga plants that were experimentally deprived of their symbiotic Crematogaster ants suffered heavily from shoot borers and pathogenic fungi (Heil 1998). Here we report that ants seem to reduce fungal infections actively in the obligate myrmecophyte Macaranga triloba (Euphorbiaceae), while ant-free plants can be easily infected. We also found extremely low chitinase activity in Macaranga plants. The plants' own biochemical defense seems to be reduced, and low chitinase activity perhaps may represent a predisposition for the evolution of myrmecophytism. These plants are therefore highly dependent on their ants, which obviously function not only as an antiherbivore defense but also as an effective agent against fungal pathogens."

Abstract: 'We discuss the dynamics of plant litter, the effects of litter on the chemical and physical environment, the direct and indirect effects of plant litter on plant populations and communities, and different adaptative traits that may be related to litter accumulation. The production of litter depends primarily on the site productivity, but other properties of the environment, as well as chance, may introduce important variation. The existence of time lags between the production of plant organs and their transformation into litter appears as a relevant character of litter dynamics seldom included in models. Herbivory, and other processes that destroy biomass or reduce productivity, may reduce the amount of litter produced. The destruction of litter encompasses a complex of interactions. The main processes, including physical and chemical degradation, consumption by invertebrates and decomposition, are differentially affected by the environment and by the physical and chemical characteristics of the litter itself. The relative importance of those processes varies among systems.'

Abstract: 'Non-governmental organizations have proposed nine different global prioritization schemes, some of them focusing on areas with low vulnerability (a proactive reasoning) and some others targeting areas with high vulnerability (a reactive reasoning). The main threat to the remaining natural habitats of these areas is the expansion of agriculture. We evaluated the spatial congruence between agricultural land cover and global conservation priority areas in the present and in the future using a spatial model of land use cover change from 2000 to 2100. We showed that by the year 2000, the extent of agriculture was larger in reactive priority areas than in the rest of the world, while it was smaller in areas highlighted as important under proactive approaches. During the twenty-first century, we found a general increase in agriculture area and the difference between the approaches of conservation schemes is expected to hold true, although we found that high-biodiversity wilderness areas (HBWA), a proactive scheme, may be specially affected in certain scenarios of future change. These results suggest an increase in conservation conflicts over this century. In face of agricultural expansion, both kinds of prioritization approaches are important, but different strategies of protection are necessary (e.g., reactive approaches need the urgent protection of remnant habitats, while proactive ones have space to create megareserves). Further, conservation organizations must include agriculture expansion data and their uncertainty in conservation planning in order to be more successful in biological conservation.'

Abstract: 'The relative densities of arboreal species of 17 surveys carried out in the Atlantic Ombrophilous Dense Forest of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo state, SE Brazil, were compared by means of multivariate analysis (cluster, TWINSPAN, PCA, DCA and CCA) to assess floristic and structural variation. The arboreal flora of this vegetation formation is heterogeneous: out of the 771 specific binomials cited, 478 were recorded only once. As the results were similar whether these 478 species were included or not, they were therefore excluded from subsequent analyses. The cluster analysis and TWINSPAN recognised two floristic-structural groups: Coastal Province and Atlantic Plateau. The DCA resulted in a gradient related to distance from the sea, from the Coastal Province towards the Atlantic Plateau (\xce\xbb1=0.6944). The CCA confirmed this separation on the first axis (\xce\xbb1=0.6944; 12.7% of total variance; p<0.01) and showed this gradient to be associated with altitude and latitude on one hand and temperature and precipitation on the other. The influence of latitude and longitude was weak. Although surveys used different criteria, only the minimum individual size adopted in sampling showed a weak influence on the second axis on the CCA (\xce\xbb2=0.4437; 8% of total variance), and sampling method showed no influence. A positive relationship between geographical distance and floristic-structural dissimilarity was detected by the Mantel test (Zobs=0.320; Zave=0.300; p<0.001). The predominance of arboreal species of restricted distribution and the great spatial variation of abundance would appear to indicate narrow niches. The occurrence of complex and non-linear gradients suggests the importance of several other abiotic features in the spatial distribution and abundance of arboreal species in the Atlantic Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the state of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo.'

Abstract: 'In this paper we bring up a Monte Carlo theory based method to measure the ground vegetation parameters, and make quantitative description of the error. The leaf area index is used as the example in the study. Its mean and variance stability at different scales or in different time is verified using both the computer simulation and the statistics of remotely sensed images. And the error of Monte Carlo sampling method is analyzed based on the normal distribution theory and the central-limit theorem. The results show that the variance of leaf area index in the same area is stable at certain scales or in the same time of different years. The difference between experimental results and theoretical ones is small. The significance of this study is to establish a measurement procedure of ground vegetation parameters with an error control system.'

Abstract: 'In this paper we specifically address the constraint of energy consumption related to wireless sensor networks deployed at remote regions where the geographical access is complicated and consequently the maintenance routines seldom occurs. This research proposes an energy management method for environmental monitoring at the Amazonian Basin, where the interval between maintenance routines is greater than 6\xc2\xa0months and the geographical location constrains the access to the sensor nodes. The proposed method is based on the duty cycling technique and aims to extend the sensor node lifespan in case of its external power source fails or its power consumption increases due to damages in sensor node devices. The management energy algorithm embedded into the sensor node employs the Shepherd Equation to simulate curves of battery discharge for each power consumption condition and thus it enables to estimate accurately the lifespan of a sensor node. Therefore, the sensor node is aware of its available energy and was programmed to react to it by switching between predefined operating modes to save energy and prolong as much as possible its lifespan. The Sensor Energy Management Method (SEMM) ensures that sensor nodes are operational throughout maintenance periods so that at least data acquisition tasks are performed to guarantee historical data sets essential to hydrological forecasts. A sensor node prototype was built and the SEMM was validated by a number of indoors experiments. The sensor node lifetime was increased by 20\xc2\xa0% when the proposed method was compared to a conventional energy use.'

Abstract: 'This paper aims to survey a few among many ecological principles that are particularly relevant to the management of protected areas. Various aspects of the relation between area of protected habitat and numbers of constituent species preserved are discussed, with emphasis of edge effects and other factors. Particular attention is given to those species which persist via local extinctions and recolonizations within a shifting mosaic of patches, and to the counter-intuitive things that can happen to such species or communities when a fraction of the patches is destroyed. The paper concludes with comments about making choices as to which areas to preserve \xe2\x80\x94 the calculus of biodiversity \xe2\x80\x94 and about more general social and economic considerations.'

Abstract: 'In a number of places, sacred forest sites play an important role in conservation and local livelihoods. Here we examine how Iban hunters and animals alike use sacred forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. To determine the relative importance of different sites in hunting, we compare hunting effort, animal species and their numbers encountered by hunters, and encounters and captures in a variety of forest sites including sacred groves. We relate the results to the role of such sites in the overall Iban agroforestry system and in the conservation of forest habitat that professional conservationists deem precious. Such land use practices, while having social and religious origins, may be important for local economic purposes, but they may also be valuable in promoting and enhancing the more global goals of biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'A distinction should be made betweentwo types of ethical problems. A Type I ethicalproblem is one in which there is no consensusas to what is ethical. A Type II ethicalproblem is one in which there is a consensus asto what is ethical, but incentives exist forindividuals to behave unethically. Type Iethical problems are resolved by making,challenging, and reasoning through moralarguments. Type II ethical problems areresolved by changing the institutionalenvironment so that people do not haveincentives to behave unethically. Type Isolutions, however, will not be effective insolving Type II problems. Examples inagriculture and elsewhere show howdistinguishing between Type I and Type IIethical problems will help in theidentification of solutions to ethical issuesin agriculture.'

Abstract: 'Three species ofBactris are recognized in the Greater Antilles:B. cubensis (from Cuba),B. plumeriana (from Hispaniola), andB. jamaicana (from Jamaica). A cladistic analysis of the non-ocreate clade\xe2\x80\x94i.e.,Bactris cubensis, B. plumeriana, B. jamaicana, B. macana, andB. gasipaes\xe2\x80\x94confirmed that the Greater Antillean species ofBactris form a monophyletic group, i.e., the Antillean clade. Synapomorphies supporting the Antillean clade are mesocarp and endocarp fibers numerous, parallel, predominantly narrow, few broad, extending the entire length of the endocarp; and leaf segments 45\xe2\x80\x9380 per side of rachis. The presence of fiber-sclereids in the leaf lamina, and petals of the staminate flowers ovate to ovatetrullate, with sparsely branched fibers, may represent additional synapomorphies.Bactris plumeriana andB. jamaicana are hypothesized to be sister species, a grouping weakly supported by their short anthers. Each species has at least one autapomorphy; therefore, all are considered to be a cladospecies. Noteworthy interpopulational variation occurs withinBactris plumeriana andB. cubensis.'

Abstract: 'The plant communities and their microclimates were surveyed and observed, and the soil fertilities were determined in six plots of evergreen broadleaved forests of different sizes and similar slope aspects on Jinyun Mountains of Chongqing in China from April to October, 2003. The relationships of biotic and abiotic factors were analyzed using the Simpson, Shannon\xe2\x80\x94Wiener, and Hill diversity indices, and stepwise multilinear regression analyses techniques. The results showed that compared with continuous evergreen broadleaved forests, five fragmentations had a lower species diversity index, and different life forms showed differences in diversity index. With the decrease in patch areas, the daily differences in air temperature (\xce\x94Ta), ground surface temperature (\xce\x94Ts), daily differences in relative humidity (\xce\x94RH), maximum wind velocity (Vmax), differences in photosynthetic available radiation (\xce\x94PAR) (at noon) of both edges and interiors, all tended to increase. Maximum wind velocity (Vmax) and photo effective radiation in forest edges were higher than those in interior forest, which presented a stronger temperature-gained edge effect. In all the fragmentations of evergreen broadleaved forests, the depth of the edge effect was the nearest from interior forest in the biggest patch (about 15 meters away from interior forest), while the depth of the edge effect was the farthest from interior forest in the smallest patch (about 25 meters away from interior forest). With regard to the water conservation function, soil water content improved along with increasing species diversity. Some of the nutritional function substances of soil increased with increasing species diversity. The elements of microclimate, such as Ta, \xce\x94Ta, \xce\x94Ts, \xce\x94RH, Vmax, and PAR, changed along with the extent of fragmented forest.'

Abstract: 'This paper aims to present an overview of the research groups on life cycle assessment (LCA) in Brazil to (i) characterize these groups, including their constitution, geographical distribution, and the nature of the institutions to which they are connected; (ii) classify the groups according to the knowledge areas and identify the existing interdisciplinarity between research lines; (iii) identify collaborative relationships between the groups; and (iv) determine the main focus of interest and applicability of the studies and activities developed.'

Abstract: 'Ethnobotanical studies and scorecard-based assessments have been used in identification and prioritisation of indigenous fruit trees with domestication and income potential at local levels. Less has been done to systematically identify species with potential for international markets. This study compared the applicability of the two methods to identify indigenous fruits with economic potential for export. The ethnobotanical study consisted of household and market surveys based on questionnaires, focus group discussions and key-informant interviews. The scorecard was based on pre-determined scoring criteria applied to species identified in the ethnobotanical study. Priority indigenous fruits identified in the ethnobotanical study included Canarium schweinfurtii, Vangueria apiculata, Garcinia buchananii and Tamarindus indica whereas the scorecard assessment identified a different set of species; i.e. V. apiculata, G. buchananii, Myrianthus arboreus, Pseudospondias microcarpa, Phoenix reclinata and Rhus vulgaris as having export potential. The ethnobotanical methods were effective in identifying species with local economic potential and hence high likelihood of adoption by local farmers while the scorecard method was found more useful to identify species with export potential.'

Abstract: 'Highly productive papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) wetlands dominate many permanently flooded areas of tropical East Africa; however, the cycling of carbon and water within these ecosystems is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to utilise Eddy Covariance (EC) techniques to measure the fluxes of carbon dioxide and water vapour between papyrus vegetation and the atmosphere in a wetland located near Jinja, Uganda on the Northern shore of Lake Victoria. Peak, midday rates of photosynthetic CO2 net assimilation were approximately 40\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol CO2\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921, while night time losses through respiration ranged between 10 and 20\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol CO2\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0s\xe2\x88\x921. Numerical integration of the flux data suggests that papyrus wetlands have the potential to sequester approximately 0.48\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921. The average daily water vapour flux from the papyrus vegetation through canopy evapotranspiration was approximately 4.75\xc2\xa0kg H2O\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0d\xe2\x88\x921, which is approximately 25% higher than water loss through evaporation from open water.'

Abstract: 'The vertical structure of one hectare of tropical rain forest was studied at Los Tuxtlas, State of Veracruz, Mexico. The structure was analysed at various scales of analysis, using different methodologies e.g. profile diagrams (0.1 ha) and vertical structure diagrams (1 ha). All profile diagrams suggested presence of stratification to some extent. However, simultaneous evaluation of several adjacent profile diagrams showed that the use of one profile diagram only can be very misleading: gaps or layers apparent in a diagram did usually not reflect gaps or layers that could be recognized in the field.'

Abstract: 'The use of herbal medicinal products and supplements has increased during last decades. At present, some herbs are used to enhance muscle strength and body mass. Emergent evidence suggests that the health benefits from plants are attributed to their bioactive compounds such as Polyphenols, Terpenoids, and Alkaloids which have several physiological effects on the human body. At times, manufacturers launch numerous products with banned ingredient inside with inappropriate amounts or fake supplement inducing harmful side effect. Unfortunately up to date, there is no guarantee that herbal supplements are safe for anyone to use and it has not helped to clear the confusion surrounding the herbal use in sport field especially. Hence, the purpose of this review is to provide guidance on the efficacy and side effect of most used plants in sport. We have identified plants according to the following categories: Ginseng, alkaloids, and other purported herbal ergogenics such as Tribulus Terrestris, Cordyceps Sinensis. We found that most herbal supplement effects are likely due to activation of the central nervous system via stimulation of catecholamines. Ginseng was used as an endurance performance enhancer, while alkaloids supplementation resulted in improvements in sprint and cycling intense exercises. Despite it is prohibited, small amount of ephedrine was usually used in combination with caffeine to enhance muscle strength in trained individuals. Some other alkaloids such as green tea extracts have been used to improve body mass and composition in athletes. Other herb (i.e. Rhodiola, Astragalus) help relieve muscle and joint pain, but results about their effects on exercise performance are missing.'

Abstract: 'Current knowledge of effects of climate change on biodiversity is briefly reviewed, and results are presented of a survey of biological research groups in the Netherlands, aimed at identifying key research issues in this field. In many areas of the world, biodiversity is being reduced by humankind through changes in land cover and use, pollution, invasions of exotic species and possibly climate change. Assessing the impact of climate change on biodiversity is difficult, because changes occur slowly and effects of climate change interact with other stress factors already imposed on the environment. Research issues identified by Dutch scientists can be grouped into: (i) spatial and temporal distributions of taxa; (ii) migration and dispersal potentials of taxa; (iii) genetic diversity and viability of (meta) populations of species; (iv) physiological tolerance of species; (v) disturbance of functional interactions between species; and (vi) ecosystem processes. Additional research should be done on direct effects of greenhouse gases, and on interactions between effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation. There are still many gaps in our knowledge of effects of climate change on biodiversity. An interdisciplinary research programme could possibly focus only on one or few of the identified research issues, and should generate input data for predictive models based on climate change scenarios.'

Abstract: 'Highly accurate observations at various scales on the land surface are urgently needed for the studies of many areas, such as hydrology, meteorology, and agriculture. With the rapid development of remote sensing techniques, remote sensing has had the capacity of monitoring many factors of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s land surface. Especially, the space-borne microwave remote sensing systems have been widely used in the quantitative monitoring of global snow, soil moisture, and vegetation parameters with their all-weather, all-time observation capabilities and their sensitivities to the characteristics of land surface factors. Based on the electromagnetic theories and microwave radiative transfer equations, researchers have achieved great successes in the microwave remote sensing studies for different sensors in recent years. This article has systematically reviewed the progresses on five research areas including microwave theoretical modeling, microwave inversion on soil moisture, snow, vegetation and land surface temperatures. Through the further enrichment of remote sensing datasets and the development of remote sensing theories and inversion techniques, remote sensing including microwave remote sensing will play a more important role in the studies and applications of the Earth systems.'

Abstract: 'We studied the factors affecting the persistence of a frugivorous butterfly species, Hamadryas februa, in a set of forested islands located in Lago Guri, a reservoir in eastern Venezuela. The roles of isolation, area and habitat quality (larval host plant density, light conditions and presence of fruiting trees) in determining island butterfly densities were investigated through observations and experiments. Butterfly densities increased significantly with increase in both island area and local larval host plant density, but were not related to distance from colonizing sources, light conditions or presence of fruiting trees. Butterfly populations on even distant islands were not augmented by the experimental introduction of adults. Butterfly residence times were higher on sites located on a large island than on small islands. However, there was no evidence that the positive correlation between adult density and host plant density was caused by increased reproduction. The results indicate that butterfly densities are not constrained by colonization capabilities but rather, by lack of appropriate host plants and high rates of emigration from islands. The study indicates the importance of considering patterns in movement and habitat heterogeneity when designing conservation strategies for insects in fragmented landscapes.'

Abstract: 'The term \xe2\x80\x9ctipping point\xe2\x80\x9d has been used to identify a critical threshold susceptible to a tiny perturbation that can qualitatively alter the state or development of a system. \xe2\x80\x9cTipping element\xe2\x80\x9d has been introduced to describe large-scale components of the Earth system that may pass a tipping point. A special issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States (PNAS) recently focused on Tipping Elements in Earth Systems has examined potential policy-relevant tipping elements in the climate system with anthropogenic forcing. Subjects such as the evaluation of El Nino/southern oscillation response to global warming, irreversible ice sheet retreat and unstoppable loss, and climate change induced Amazon rainforest dieback were presented in this special issue. An earlier PNAS research article investigated the imprecision of probability assessments of tipping points identified for the global climate system.'

Abstract: 'We studied soil and forest floor conditions, regeneration patterns oftrees, and forest structure and floristic composition along a gradient ofdominance by Pinus spp. in disturbed stands in thehighlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Seedlings, saplings, and adults of treespecies were counted and measured in 2-3 circular plots (1000m2 each) in 36 forest stands (a total of 38 treespecies). Dominance of broadleaved trees other thanQuercusspp. was negatively correlated with basal area of Pinusspp. (P < 0.001). Soils of pine-dominated stands weremore compacted, less acidic, and less fertile (lower C.E.C., nitrogen, andorganic matter content). Numerous broadleaved trees may depend on anoak-dominated canopy to regenerate, and changes associated to pinelandsexpansion may compromise their long-term persistence. However, seedlings andsaplings of Quercus spp. were abundant in stands with bothan oak- or pine-dominated canopy. The results suggest that a plan forsustainable forest utilization in the study region, and in other similarpopulated tropical highlands, could take advantage of the abundant oakregeneration and coexistence with pines in the canopy.'

Abstract: 'The spatial variation of soil greenhouse gas fluxes (GHG; carbon dioxide\xe2\x80\x94CO2, methane\xe2\x80\x94CH4 and nitrous oxide\xe2\x80\x94N2O) remains poorly understood in highly complex ecosystems such as tropical forests. We used 240 individual flux measurements of these three GHGs from different soil types, at three topographical positions and in two extreme hydric conditions in the tropical forests of the Guiana Shield (French Guiana, South America) to (1) test the effect of topographical positions on GHG fluxes and (2) identify the soil characteristics driving flux variation in these nutrient-poor tropical soils. Surprisingly, none of the three GHG flux rates differed with topographical position. CO2 effluxes covaried with soil pH, soil water content (SWC), available nitrogen and total phosphorus. The CH4 fluxes were best explained by variation in SWC, with soils acting as a sink under drier conditions and as a source under wetter conditions. Unexpectedly, our study areas were generally sinks for N2O and N2O fluxes were partly explained by total phosphorus and available nitrogen concentrations. This first study describing the spatial variation of soil fluxes of the three main GHGs measured simultaneously in forests of the Guiana Shield lays the foundation for specific studies of the processes underlying the observed patterns.'

Abstract: 'A synthesis of ecological data available for subterranean fishes throughout the world is presented, and comparatively analyzed in an evolutionary context. Methods of ecological research are described, and their potential and limitations for the study of hypogean fishes are discussed. Ecology of troglobitic (exclusively subterranean) fishes is discussed with focus on distribution areas, population densities and sizes, use of habitat and movements, life cycle and feeding. When data are available, these species are compared with their epigean relatives. Putative ecological autapomorphies of troglobitic fishes, including habitat change, adaptations to cope with food scarcity, and precocial lifestyles, are interpreted in ecological and evolutionary contexts. Species interactions among subterranean species, including cases of syntopy and predation are briefly analyzed. Non-troglobitic hypogean fishes, with their ecological importance and evolutionary role, are also addressed. Problems of classification of subterranean fishes according to the Schiner-Racovitza system (troglobites, troglophiles and trogloxenes) are discussed, and a scenario of evolution of subterranean populations is presented.'

Abstract: 'The alkaloids of Uncaria tomentosa micropropagated plantlets and root cultures were isolated and identified by NMR and mass spectrometry. Plantlets yielded pteropodine (1), isopteropodine (2), mitraphylline (3), isomitraphylline (4), uncarine F (5), speciophylline (6), rhynchophylline (7) and isorhynchophylline (8). In plantlets growing under continuous light, tetracyclic alkaloids 7 and 8 decreased from 20\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.8 at 2 months to 2.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.33\xc2\xa0mg/g dry wt at 6 months, while the pentacyclic alkaloids 1\xe2\x80\x934 increased from 7.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.4 to 15\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.05\xc2\xa0mg/g dry wt, supporting their biogenetic conversion. Micropropagated plantlets produced four times more alkaloids (27.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa03.1\xc2\xa0mg/g dry wt) than greenhouse plants. Plantlet roots yielded 3, 4, 8 and the glucoindole alkaloids 3\xce\xb1-dihydrocadambine (9) and dolichantoside (10), the last one not previously found in Uncaria.'

Abstract: 'Considering that adjuvant arthritis is an experimental model of arthritis widely used for preclinical testing of numerous anti-arthritic agents, which were taken by a large number of patients worldwide, it is of great interest to investigate the therapeutic action of compounds with anti-inflammatory properties, such as Uncaria tomentosa extract. Moreover, there are no studies demonstrating the effect of U. tomentosa on the metabolism of adenine nucleotides published so far. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of U. tomentosa extract on E-NTPDase and E-ADA activities in lymphocytes of Complete Freund\xe2\x80\x99s Adjuvant (CFA) arthritis induced rats.'

Abstract: 'Being a controversial industry, oil companies turn to corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a means to obtain legitimacy. Adopting a case study methodology, this research examines the characteristics of CSR strategies and CSR communication tactics of six oil companies by analyzing their 2011\xe2\x80\x932012 web site content. We found that all six companies engaged in CSR activities addressing the needs of various stakeholders and had cross-sector partnerships. CSR information on these companies\xe2\x80\x99 web sites was easily accessible, often involving the use of multimedia technologies and sometimes social media platforms. Furthermore, to boost the credibility of their CSR messages, these companies utilized a variety of tactics, such as factual arguments and two-sided messages. In sum, this research unveils the interconnectedness among business strategy, CSR practices, and CSR communication in oil companies\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to gain legitimacy in an environment of controversy. The article ends with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the research findings.'

Abstract: 'Sampling design is a key issue when establishing species inventories and characterizing habitats within highly heterogeneous landscapes. Sampling efforts in such environments may be constrained and many field studies only rely on subjective and/or qualitative approaches to design collection strategy. The region of Cacao, in French Guiana, provides an excellent study site to understand the presence and abundance of Anopheles mosquitoes, their species dynamics and the transmission risk of malaria across various environments. We propose an objective methodology to define a stratified sampling design. Following thorough environmental characterization, a factorial analysis of mixed groups allows the data to be reduced and non-collinear principal components to be identified while balancing the influences of the different environmental factors. Such components defined new variables which could then be used in a robust k-means clustering procedure. Then, we identified five clusters that corresponded to our sampling strata and selected sampling sites in each stratum.'

Abstract: 'Natural ecosystems comprise the planet\xe2\x80\x99s wild plant and animal resources, but large tracts of land have been converted to agroecosystems to support the demand for agricultural products. This conversion limits the number of plant species and decreases the soil biological diversity. Here we used high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the responses of soil bacterial communities in long-term converted and fertilized red soils (a type of Ferralic Cambisol). We observed that soil bacterial diversity was strongly affected by different types of fertilization management. Oligotrophic bacterial taxa demonstrated large relative abundances in chemically fertilized soil, whereas copiotrophic bacterial taxa were found in large relative abundances in organically fertilized and fallow management soils. Only organic-inorganic fertilization exhibited the same local taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity as that of a natural ecosystem. However, the independent use of organic or inorganic fertilizer reduced local taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and caused biotic homogenization. This study demonstrated that the homogenization of bacterial communities caused by natural-to-agricultural ecosystem conversion can be mitigated by employing rational organic-inorganic fertilization management.'

Abstract: 'The dominant factors controlling soil bacterial community variation within the tropics are poorly known. We sampled soils across a range of land use types\xe2\x80\x94primary (unlogged) and logged forests and crop and pasture lands in Malaysia. PCR-amplified soil DNA for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene targeting the V1\xe2\x80\x93V3 region was pyrosequenced using the 454 Roche machine. We found that land use in itself has a weak but significant effect on the bacterial community composition. However, bacterial community composition and diversity was strongly correlated with soil properties, especially soil pH, total carbon, and C/N ratio. Soil pH was the best predictor of bacterial community composition and diversity across the various land use types, with the highest diversity close to neutral pH values. In addition, variation in phylogenetic structure of dominant lineages (Alphaproteobacteria, Beta/Gammaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria) is also significantly correlated with soil pH. Together, these results confirm the importance of soil pH in structuring soil bacterial communities in Southeast Asia. Our results also suggest that unlike the general diversity pattern found for larger organisms, primary tropical forest is no richer in operational taxonomic units of soil bacteria than logged forest, and agricultural land (crop and pasture) is actually richer than primary forest, partly due to selection of more fertile soils that have higher pH for agriculture and the effects of soil liming raising pH.'

Abstract: 'Few moral arguments have been made against vegetarian diets. One exception is the \xe2\x80\x9cLogic of the Larder:\xe2\x80\x9d We do animals a favor by purchasing their meat, eggs, and milk, for if we did not purchase these products, fewer animals would exist. This argument fails because many farm animals have lives that are probably not worth living, while others prevent a significant number of wild animals from existing. Even if this were not so, the purchase of animal products uses resources that could otherwise be used to bring a much greater number of animals into existence.'

Abstract: 'The queen of the Brazilian speciesPheidole embolopyx is unique among ants in possessing a posteriorly truncated abdomen; in addition, the rear surface is clothed in unusual, hook-shaped hairs (fig. 1\xe2\x80\x933). Contrary to expectation, however, our studies have shown that the queen does not use the abdomen to block nest entrances or otherwise to oppose opponents directly.'

Abstract: 'Due to climate change, the amount, frequency, and intensity of precipitation worldwide are changing. There is increasing evidence that hydrological change severely affects species interactions and that these effects might overrule direct autecological responses, although this is currently understudied. Here, I synthesize published data on 405 interactions to show how changes in soil moisture affect the frequency or strength of plant-mediated biotic interactions. Despite substantial variation among published responses, general patterns have emerged. A recurrent finding in the synthesized studies is that dryness impedes beneficial interactions between plants and other organisms (decreased mycorrhization and infection with other symbiotic endophytes, less pollinator visits, less active decomposers) and increases detrimental interactions (increased performance of sucking insects, pathogen infection and competition between functionally similar plants). For increased wetness, which is far less studied, stress intensity seems to matter: Slightly increased precipitation often benefits plants and thereby associated interaction partners (increased mycorrhization and infection with symbiotic endophytes, increased herbivore performance), while extreme waterlogging or flooding impedes many interactions (decreased decomposer activity and mycorrhization). Legacy effects of changed soil moisture on plant community composition can amplify or reverse short-term effects on interactions. Although some concepts acknowledge the role of stress intensity (mild versus severe) and stress type (permanent versus pulsed) empirical research testing-related hypotheses is largely lacking, as is research on the role of soil moisture legacies for interactions.'

Abstract: 'A nearly 40-year debate on the origins of carbon supporting animal production in lotic systems has spawned numerous conceptual theories emphasizing the importance of autochthonous carbon, terrestrial carbon, or both (depending on river stage height). Testing theories has been hampered by lack of adequate analytical methods to distinguish in consumer tissue between ultimate autochthonous and allochthonous carbon. Investigators initially relied on assimilation efficiencies of gut contents and later on bulk tissue stable isotope analysis or fatty acid methods. The newest technique in amino acid, compound specific, stable isotope analysis (AA-CSIA), however, enables investigators to link consumers to food sources by tracing essential amino acids from producers to consumers. We used AA-CSIA to evaluate nutrient sources for 5 invertivorous and 6 piscivorous species in 2 hydrogeomorphically contrasting large rivers: the anastomosing Upper Mississippi River (UMR) and the mostly constricted lower Ohio River (LOR). Museum specimens we analyzed isotopically had been collected by other investigators over many decades (UMR: 1900\xe2\x80\x931969; LOR: 1931\xe2\x80\x931970). Our results demonstrate that on average algae contributed 58.5% (LOR) to 75.6% (UMR) of fish diets. The next highest estimated contributions of food sources were from C3 terrestrial plants (21.1 and 11.5% for the LOR and UMR, respectively). Moreover, results from 11 individually examined species consistently demonstrated the importance of algae for most fish species in these trophic guilds. Differences among rivers in relative food source availability resulting from contrasting hydrogeomorphic complexity may account for relative proportions of amino acids derived from algae.'

Abstract: 'Peri-urban pressure on the Luki Biosphere Reserve in Bas-Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, is fuelled by growing demand in urban markets coupled with easy access. With data from 175 randomly selected households, this paper examines factors that motivate households to collect two major forest products found in the reserve for cash. We analyse the factors determining the choice of engaging in collection of bushmeat and eru (Gnetum africanum) and the factors determining the success (outcome) in collection using the Heckman selection model. This model explicitly separates estimation of selection into the activity from the outcome, to provide unbiased estimates of both. Results show that being local, higher household labour availability and higher asset endowment were positively related to selection into bushmeat hunting, reflecting higher risk-carrying capacities, ease of access to equipment and resources. Greater market distance being a female-headed household and greater age of household heads negatively affected selection into eru collection, reflecting characteristics of cash harvesting activities. Low education and more local knowledge characterised more successful outcome of eru collection, whereas having more household labour tended to lower outcomes of both bushmeat and eru collection suggesting that labour pools engaged in these activities were not sufficiently skilled, or that a higher proportion was consumed in such households. We discuss our findings in relation to the role of these activities in providing a pathway out of poverty and stress the needs for better integration of conservation and development policies.'

Abstract: 'Genetic analysis provides a robust method for understanding the ways in which human interventions in ecosystems may affect genetic diversity and species survival, providing an empirical basis for evidence-based conservation and management planning. This review aims to (1) describe the most informative and widely used molecular markers for genotype analysis, and describe the methods for using that genotype data to understand (2) genetic diversity and structure; and (3) mating system, pollen and seed dispersal. For each area of investigation, we discuss the types of analyses that can be performed, the software available for the analyses, what the analyses indicate, and provide examples from the literature of studies using these approaches. The review focuses on Neotropical tree species because Neotropical forests are highly diverse and are under particular threat from anthropogenic land-use change, and trees are useful model organisms to investigate patterns over evolutionary time and across geographical space.'

Abstract: 'Four different kinds of water treatments were applied to study the photosynthetic eco-physiological characteristics of Taxodium ascendens seedlings in the environment of the Three Gorges hydro-fluctuation belt. The four kinds of water treatments were: normal growth water condition (CK), light drought stress (T1), soil water saturation (T2), and soil submersion (T3). The results showed that different water treatments could effectively influence the content of the photosynthetic pigment, leaf gas exchange and apparent resources use efficiency of T. ascendens seedlings. It was also demonstrated that the T. ascendens seedlings could not only tolerate water submersion and wet conditions but also endure a certain degree of drought. To establish a protection forest system in the hydro-fluctuation belt in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, the species T. ascendens is suitable for planting in conditions of root submersion or water-saturated soil. In case it is planted in drought conditions, this tree species should be watered appropriately in order to keep its normal net photosynthetic rate.'

Abstract: 'Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.) oil (SIO) is one of the vegetable oils with the highest content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (about 50% \xce\xb1-linolenic acid, and 35% linoleic acid), thus being prone to oxidation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the emulsion composition on the physical properties and oxidative stability of SIO microencapsulated by spray drying using modified starch (Hi-Cap 100) and maltodextrin in a mass ratio of 75:25, as wall material. The processing yield (PY), microencapsulation efficiency (MEE), and some selected physical properties (moisture content, A  w , color, sorption isotherms, flowing and thermal stability) of the SIO microcapsules (SIO-M) were investigated as a function of the oil loading (10, 20, and 30%) and the concentration of wall material solids (20 and 30%). The obtained results indicated that both the PY and MEE were significantly reduced as the oil loading increased, varying from 50 to 35%, and between 96 and 82%, respectively. FTIR analyses revealed that SIO was effectively encapsulated into the wall material. SIO-M were spherical in shape, and showed high oxidation stability upon accelerated tests. According to the thermogravimetric analysis, SIO-M could resist the pasteurization and sterilization processes used in the food industry, without suffering thermal decomposition. The sorption isotherms of SIO-M fitted better with the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer model. These results indicate that SIO could be successfully microencapsulated by spray drying using Hi-Cap 100 and maltodextrin as wall materials, from emulsions with a concentration of 30% wall material, and 20 to 30% oil loading.'

Abstract: 'Southern Chile experienced serious deforestation during the past century and it is projected that by the year 2025 Chile will be devoid of native forests. One of the most important endemic tree species of the country and at the same time one of the most endangered ones is Araucaria\xc2\xa0araucana (Mol.) C. Koch, the monkey-puzzle tree. It grows in the Andes Mountains, homeland of the indigenous Mapuche Pewenche people who depend on this tree. This paper is based on participatory field research with a Mapuche Pewenche community in the southern Chilean Andes on their ecological knowledge, values, use and management of the Araucaria\xc2\xa0araucana forest. It attempts to reveal how indigenous people and their knowledge contribute to the sustainable management of these forests. The paper (1) illustrates the complexity of indigenous ecological knowledge of Araucaria\xc2\xa0araucana and its efficacy in native forest management, (2) explores the link between the conservation and use of biodiversity by the indigenous people, and (3) provides answers relevant to native forest management and conservation strategies ex-situ and in-situ incorporating indigenous and scientific knowledge, thus providing a contribution towards integrated natural resource management.'

Abstract: 'The capture and efficient use of limiting resources influence the competitive success of individual plant species as well as species diversity across resource gradients. In simulations, efficient nutrient acquisition or nutrient retention by species were key predictors of success when nutrients were limiting. Increased nutrient supply favored species with characteristics that improved light interception or light use. Ecological theory suggests that low diversity on fertile sites may be a consequence of competitive exclusion by one or a few species with superior light-interception characteristics. On infertile sites, competitive exclusion may be a function of superior nutrient-acquisition characteristics in species. At intermediate fertility, a shift from single-resource specialization to a balanced effort in the acquisition of multiple resources should allow for greater species diversity. Thus, a unimodal relationship between diversity and nutrient supply, vegetation biomass, or productivity is predicted. However, simulations demonstrated alternate relationships depending on the ecosystem characteristic to which diversity was compared. Diversity was greatest at intermediate total biomass but increased monotonically with net primary production\n and nitrogen (N) supply. The highest diversity occurred midrange on a scale of community-level leaf area to fine-root length ratios, which in the context of the model indicates that the vegetation as a whole was simultaneously limited by both N and light and that effort toward the acquisition of both resources is distributed in such a way that both resources are equally exploited. Diversity was lowered by the presence of species with a superior ability to sequester resources.'

Abstract: 'Elemental and isotopic compositions of organic matter in surficial sediments from five transects across Lagoa do Ca\xc3\xa7\xc3\xb3 (Brazil) were analyzed to identify the depth-related processes that affect the production and deposition of sedimentary organic matter in this shallow tropical lake. Each of four transverse transects began at a margin dominated by aquatic macrophytes (Eleocharis), crossed the central deep part of the lake, and terminated in the opposite, macrophyte-dominated margin. In each transect, TOC concentrations, C/N ratios, and \xce\xb413C values decreased between 0 and 4\xc2\xa0m, whereas \xce\xb415N values increased. The variables remained stable in sediment from 4\xc2\xa0m water depth to the center of the lake at 10\xc2\xa0m. The depth-related patterns reflect differences in both the delivery and the deposition of organic matter in the lake. Organic matter is produced in abundance in the marginal area by emersed and submerged macrophyte vegetation that diminishes with depth and disappears at 4 meters. After the disappearance of macrophytes, organic matter is produced at low rates principally by open-lake phytoplankton. Drawdown of dissolved oxygen is high in the lake margins, but it is low in the oligotrophic open waters of the lake. Preservation of organic matter is consequently better in sediments of the lake margins than in deep waters. The depth-related pattern of organic matter delivery and deposition in the sediments of Lagoa do Ca\xc3\xa7\xc3\xb3, in which water levels are sensitive to groundwater fluctuations, shows that the elemental and isotopic compositions of sediment organic matter can provide a record of changes in the paleohydrology of this and other similar shallow lake systems.'

Abstract: 'Fragmentation exposes plants to extreme environmental conditions with implications for species phenology and reproduction. We investigated whether isolation and edge effects influence size, flowering time, fruit set, and seedling establishment of Anadenanthera peregrina var. falcata. We compared trees in the interior (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8985), and on the edge (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8974) of a cerrado savanna fragment as well as in a pasture (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8926) with respect to size, flowering phenology, flower and fruit production, fruit and seed set, predispersal seed predation, and seedling establishment. Trees in the pasture were larger and produced a higher number of flowers and fruits than trees on the edge and interior, yet seed set did not differ across environments. The plant size structure explained the flower and fruit production, and the self-compatibility breeding system caused a similar seed set regardless of the environment. First flowering was later and fruit set higher in the interior. We argue that time of first flower influenced the fruit set of Anadenathera. Edge and isolated trees started to flower earlier as a response to microclimatic conditions\xe2\x80\x94mainly temperature\xe2\x80\x94reducing the fruit set. Predispersal seed predation was lower among pasture trees. Conversely, we found seedlings only on the edge and in the interior of cerrado, suggesting that the pasture was of poor quality habitat for Anadenanthera recruitment. Isolation affected the plant size structure and reproduction of Anadenanthera trees. Studies comparing plant phenology under contrasting environmental conditions may offer clues on how global change may affect plant reproduction in the tropics.'

Abstract: 'Soil is a vital biological habitat, which is of primary importance in determining and regulating biological activity and biodiversity. Therefore, it is Earth\xe2\x80\x99s most important resource in sustaining both belowground and aboveground biological activities. Biodiversity versus landscape diversity and land use practices in multifunctional landscapes have been addressed. Humans have so manipulated nature that few locations in the world remain without human influence, causing unforeseen changes in ecosystem continuously and biodiversity. Among the environmental compartments, about 90\xc2\xa0% of environmental pollutants are bound with soil particles. The soil-bound pollutants may be released to the soil solution through physical, chemical and biological interfacial interactions and pose a threat to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. These interfacial interactions are especially important in the rhizosphere, where the kinds and concentrations of biomolecules are different from the bulk soil because of intense biological activity. These biomolecules affect biogeochemical processes, soil microbial ecology, nutrient and contaminant dynamics, abiotic and biotic factors, and soil biodiversity through allelopathic interactions. Soil interfacial interactions under different pedogenic processes and anthropogenic activity in relation to belowground biodiversity and the impact on aboveground biodiversity, productivity and integrity should be an important and exciting area of science for years to come.'

Abstract: 'The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa has captured the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention and has been described as a humanitarian crisis and a threat to international security by Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization (Chan 2014). As of October 25th of this year, a total of 10,141 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported primarily in five countries, including Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone, resulting in 4922 deaths thus far (WHO 2014a). The prediction is that without drastic control measures the number of cases and deaths could increase to thousands per week in the coming months (WHO Ebola Response Team 2014).'

Abstract: 'Interactions between plants and animals are analyzed starting from the advantages gained by animals and proceeding to those gained exclusively by plants. These interactions are essentially of five types: 1. predation of plants by animals; 2. benevolence of plants towards certain animals to prevent or reduce predation; 3. predation by plants (carnivorous plants); 4. symbiosis and mutualism; 5. seduction and deception of animals by plants for dispersal of plant reproductive structures. All types of plants are preyed on by animals, though from as far back in evolution as algae, certain plant molecules reduce or prevent predation. In the most primitive land plants, other types of interactions beneficial for plants are encountered. More evolved land plants (angiosperms) show all facets of the five types of interaction, whereas in prokaryotic and eukaryotic algae there is only predation and in some cases countermeasures to avoid it. An evolutionary path leading from predation, the original condition, to seduction, deception and carnivory, is also postulated. '

Abstract: 'Forested soils are being increasingly transformed to agricultural fields in response to growing demands for food crop. This modification of the land use is known to result in deterioration of soil properties, in particular its fertility. To reduce the impact of the human activities and mitigate their effects on the soil, it is important to understand the factors responsible for the modification of soil properties. In this paper we reviewed the principal processes affecting soil quality during land use changes, focusing in particular on the effect of soil moisture dynamics on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. Both physical and biological processes, including degradation of litter and humus, and soil moisture evolution at the diurnal and seasonal time scales were considered, highlighting the impact of hydroclimatic variability on nutrient turnover along with the consequences of land use changes from forest to agricultural soil and vice-versa. In order to identify to what extent different models are suitable for long-term predictions of soil turnover, and to understand whether some simulators are more suited to specific environmental conditions or ecosystems, we enumerated the principal features of the most popular existing models dealing with C and N turnover. Among these models, we considered in detail a mechanistic compartment-based model. To show the capabilities of the model and to demonstrate how it can be used as a predictive tool to forecast the effects of land use changes on C and N dynamics, four different scenarios were studied, intertwining two different climate conditions (with and without seasonality) with two contrasting soils having physical properties that are representative of forest and agricultural soils. The model incorporates synthetic time series of stochastic precipitation, and therefore soil moisture evolution through time. Our main findings in simulating these scenarios are that (1) forest soils have higher concentrations of C and N than agricultural soils as a result of higher litter decomposition; (2) high frequency changes in water saturations under seasonal climate scenarios are commensurate with C and N concentrations in agricultural soils; and (3) due to their different physical properties, forest soils attenuate the seasonal climate-induced frequency changes in water saturation, with accompanying changes in C and N concentrations. The model was shown to be capable of simulating the long term effects of modified physical properties of agricultural soils, being thus a promising tool to predict future consequences of practices affecting sustainable agriculture, such as tillage (leading to erosion), ploughing, harvesting, irrigation and fertilization, leading to C and N turnover changes and in consequence, in terms of agriculture production.'

Abstract: 'In bioacoustic recognition approaches, a \xe2\x80\x9cflat\xe2\x80\x9d classifier is usually trained to recognize several species of anurans, where the number of classes is equal to the number of species. Consequently, the complexity of the classification function increases proportionally with the number of species. To avoid this issue, we propose a \xe2\x80\x9chierarchical\xe2\x80\x9d approach that decomposes the problem into three taxonomic levels: the family, the genus, and the species. To accomplish this, we transform the original single-labelled problem into a multi-output problem (multi-label and multi-class) considering the biological taxonomy of the species. We then develop a top-down method using a set of classifiers organized as a hierarchical tree. We test and compare two hierarchical methods, using (1) one classifier per parent node and (2) one classifier per level, against a flat approach. Thus, we conclude that it is possible to predict the same set of species as a flat classifier, and additionally obtain new information about the samples and their taxonomic relationship. This helps us to better understand the problem and achieve additional conclusions by the inspection of the confusion matrices at the three classification levels. In addition, we propose a soft decision rule based on the joint probabilities of hierarchy pathways. With this we are able to identify and reject confusing cases. We carry out our experiments using cross-validation performed by individuals. This form of CV avoids mixing syllables that belong to the same specimens in the testing and training sets, preventing an overestimate of the accuracy and generalizing the predictive capabilities of the system. We tested our methods in a dataset with sixty individual frogs, from ten different species, eight genera, and four families, achieving a final Macro-Fscore of 80 and 70% with and without applying the rejection rule, respectively.'

Abstract: 'Human-induced climate change is expected to increase both the frequency and severity of extreme climate events, but their ecological impacts on root dynamics are poorly understood. We conducted a 1-year pulse warming and precipitation experiment in a tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma, USA to examine responses of root dynamics. We collected data in the pre-treatment year of 2002, imposed four treatments (control, 4\xc2\xb0C warming, doubled precipitation, and warming plus doubled precipitation) in 2003, and observed post-treatment effects in 2004. Root biomass dynamics (for example, root growth and death) were measured using sequential coring and ingrowth coring methods. Treatment effects were not significant on standing root biomass in 2003, although root growth rate was significantly higher in the warmed than control plots. However, in the post-treatment year, the warmed plots had significantly lower standing root biomass than the controls, likely resulting from increased root death rate. Root death rate was significantly lower in the doubled precipitation and warmed plus doubled precipitation plots than that in the warmed plots in 2004. The root:shoot ratio showed similar responses to the post-treatments as standing root biomass, whereas aboveground biomass changed relatively little, indicating that roots were more sensitive to lagged effects than aboveground biomass. Our results demonstrate that root growth and death rates are highly sensitive to extreme climate events and lagged effects of extreme climate on root dynamics are important in assessing terrestrial carbon-cycle feedbacks to climate change.'

Abstract: 'The great diversity of Camponotus, high levels of geographic, intraspecific and morphological variation common to most species of this genus make the determination of the interspecific limits of Camponotus a complex task. The Cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene was sequenced in this study to serve as an auxiliary tool in the identification of two taxa of Camponotus thought to be morphologically similar. Additionally, characteristics related to nesting were described. Five to fifteen workers from twenty-one colonies were analyzed, collected from twigs scattered in the leaf litter and from trees located in different regions of Brazil. Phylogenetic reconstructions, haplotype network, and nesting strategies confirmed the existence of two species and that they correspond to Camponotus senex and Camponotus textor. Our results emphasize that the COI can be used as an additional tool for the identification of morphologically similar Camponotus species.'

Abstract: 'We investigated factors affecting seed rain beneath nine fleshy-fruited fruiting plant species growing in a 1-ha plot of planted Pinus thunbergii in central Japan. We tested whether the numbers of seeds and seed species dropped by birds beneath fruiting plants were correlated with the number of fruits removed by birds from the plants. Most of fruiting plant species with high fruit removal had significantly high seed rain. Both the numbers of seeds and seed species dropped were significantly, positively correlated with the number of fruits removed across for all fruiting plant species. Therefore, fruit removal predicted the difference among heterospecific fruiting plants in seed rain. We also tested whether the number of fruits removed from fruiting plants by birds was related with fruit crop size, fruit size, and height of the plants, and the numbers of fruits and fruit species of neighboring plants near the plants. Most of fruiting plant species with high fruit crop size had significantly high fruit removal. The number of fruits removed was significantly, positively correlated with both the fruit crop size and the number of neighboring fruits across the nine fruiting plant species. However, the effect of the neighboring fruit density on fruit removal was lower remarkably than that of fruit crop size. Therefore, fruit crop size best predicted the differences among heterospecific fruiting plants in fruit removal. We suggest that fruiting plant species with high fruit crop size and high fruit removal contribute to intensive seed rain beneath them.'

Abstract: 'The rapidly developing rural tourism industry in China has deeply influenced the livelihoods of rural households. This study compares the impact of rural tourism development in poor areas on the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 livelihoods, based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework proposed by the United Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s Department for International Development. Gougezhuang, a tourist village, and Jiaojiekou, a non-tourist village, both located in Yesanpo Tourism District in the state-level povertystricken Laishui County, Hebei Province, were selected as case studies. The livelihood models of the two villages show great differentiation after 20 years of tourism development. Gougezhuang Village has been driven by the tourism industry and farmers are employed locally, enjoying a relatively higher-income life, with a developmental livelihood model. In contrast, farmers in Jiaojiekou Village earn their living mainly by leaving home to work in the city. They have a low income, with a survival livelihood model, supported by part-time business. Considering that the two villages are adjacent and have similar development backgrounds, the analysis results indicate that rural tourism has an apparent locationspecific effect on poverty alleviation and socioeconomic development, but the development of rural tourism is limited regarding large-scale poverty alleviation efforts in poor areas. To implement a propoor- tourism strategy and achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to implement comprehensive management measures to change the local conditions of rural settlements and make full use of the spillover effect of tourist consumption.'

Abstract: 'Mangrove forests have survived a number of catastrophic climate events since first appearing along the shores of the Tethys Sea during the late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary. The existence of mangrove peat deposits worldwide attests to past episodes of local and regional extinction, primarily in response to abrupt, rapid rises in sea level. Occupying a harsh margin between land and sea, most mangrove plants and associated organisms are predisposed to be either resilient or resistant to most environmental change. Based on the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts, mangrove forests along arid coasts, in subsiding river deltas, and on many islands are predicted to decline in area, structural complexity, and/or in functionality, but mangroves will continue to expand polewards. It is highly likely that they will survive into the foreseeable future as sea level, global temperatures, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise.'

Abstract: 'Studying biodiversity change in existing typical ecosystems of the world under possible global climate change and local human activities is important for diversity conservation. An adapted forest dynamics model is used to simulate tree diversity change of the remaining primary mixed-broadleaved Korean pine forest (RPMKPF) in northeast China under global climate change and local human activities for the next 50 years. Human activities include logging, which removes all big trees (DBH > 50 cm), removing all individuals of each single species and all species of each functional type (shade tolerant, shade intolerant and medium type tree species). As results for RPMKPF, the \xce\xb1 index of tree diversity decreases under climate change, but it increases significantly under a combination of climate change and logging. Removing all individuals of each single species significantly affects the tree diversity of the ecosystem. After the removal of shade tolerant species, both \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2c indices of tree diversity experience a significant change. The \xce\xb1 index decreases significantly under climate change when shade intolerant or medium type tree species are removed, but the \xce\xb2c index does not change significantly. The results of this study have implications for tree diversity management in RPMKPF under climate change and human activities.'

Abstract: 'After discussing methods for and the difficulties of determining optimal land use, particularly in relation to conservation and sustainability issues, prospects for establishing conservation networks so as to preserve the wildemess characteristics of the Cape York Peninsula area are considered. According to a number of international studies, nature conservation in this region should be given a high priority. While Cape York is sparsely settled, it is not, however, a complete wilderness. Mining, cattle ranching, forestry, fishing, tourism and land use by Aborigines, frequently conflict with nature conservation in this region. But most of the land currently belongs to the Crown (State), even though Crown title is now subject to counter-claims by Aborigines following the Mabo case which is outlined, and most is held as leasehold by its users. In theory, leasehold from the Crown should give considerable scope for altering land use in the region, and instituting a system of conservation networks in the area based on core protected areas, such as those suggested by the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland. Nevertheless, strategic land use planning for Cape York Peninsula is difficult because knowledge about the stock of natural resources and current land uses in the region is very imperfect, and conflicts between interest groups at the regional, State and national level are unlikely to allow for easy harmonious resolutions of land use disputes.'

Abstract: 'The transition to agriculture is generally acknowledged to be the economic foundation for population growth over the last 10,000\xc2\xa0years and for modern civilization itself. Dates for pristine transitions to agriculture have become a key input into empirical work on economic growth over the very long run. We propose a model of the transition in which population and technology respond endogenously to climate. The available data on the southwest Asian case, other cases of pristine transition, and cases of non-transition are consistent with our model, but often inconsistent with rival explanations. In addition, our theory of the origins of agriculture has implications for instrumental variable strategies that can be used in empirical research on long run economic growth and development.'

Abstract: 'Within the global forest area, a diverse range of forest types exist with each supporting varying amounts of biomass and allocations to different plant components. At country to continental scales, remote sensing techniques have been progressively developed to quantify the above-ground biomass (AGB) of these forests, with these based on optical, radar, and/or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) (airborne and spaceborne) data. However, none have been found to be globally applicable at high (\xe2\x89\xa430\xc2\xa0m) resolution, largely because of different forest structures (e.g., heights, covers, allocations of AGB) and varying environmental conditions (e.g., frozen, inundated). For this reason, techniques have varied between the major forest biomes. However, when combined, these estimates provide some insight into the distribution of AGB at country to global levels with associated levels of uncertainty. Comparisons of data and derived products have, in some cases, also contributed to our understanding of changes in carbon stocks across large areas. Further improvements in estimates are anticipated with the launch of new spaceborne LiDAR and SAR that have been specifically designed for better retrieval of forest structure and AGB.'

Abstract: 'An endophytic fungus of Persea indica was identified, on the basis of its anamorphic stage, as Nodulosporium sp. by SEM. Partial sequence analysis of ITS rDNA revealed the identity of the teleomorphic stage of the fungus as Hypoxylon sp. It produces an impressive spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), most notably 1,8-cineole, 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene, and tentatively identified (+)-.alpha.-methylene-.alpha.-fenchocamphorone, among many others, most of which are unidentified. Six-day-old cultures of Hypoxylon sp. displayed maximal VOC-antimicrobial activity against Botrytis cinerea, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Cercospora beticola, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum suggesting that the VOCs may play some role in the biology of the fungus and its survival in its host plant. Media containing starch- or sugar-related substrates best supported VOC production by the fungus. Direct on-line quantification of VOCs was measured by proton transfer mass spectrometry covering a continuous range with optimum VOC production occurred at 6 days at 145 ppmv with a rate of production of 7.65 ppmv/h. This report unequivocally demonstrates that 1,8-cineole (a monoterpene) is produced by a microorganism, which represents a novel and important source of this compound. This monoterpene is an octane derivative and has potential use as a fuel additive as do the other VOCs of this organism. Thus, fungal sourcing of this compound and other VOCs as produced by Hypoxylon sp. greatly expands their potential applications in medicine, industry, and energy production.'

Abstract: 'The establishment of nature reserves is a key approach for biodiversity conservation worldwide. However, there is a lack of unified methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of nature reserves, particularly in China, the world\xe2\x80\xb2s most populous nation supporting some of the most valuable biodiversity hotspots in the world. In this study, we conducted a long-term and large-scale analysis of the effectiveness of 20 of the earliest nature reserves established in Hainan Province, an island home to among the highest concentration of plants and animals in China. Remote sensing imagery from 1988, 1998, and 2008 were analyzed to investigate the temporal and spatial changes of natural forests in these nature reserves and surrounding areas. We also conducted transition matrix analysis and principle component analysis to identify the driving factors that affect the protection effectiveness of nature reserves. The results were as follows: 1) During the 20-year period from 1988 to 2008, natural forests coverage of the 20 studied nature reserves dropped 2.34 percentage points, whereas the natural forests coverage dropped 11.31 percentage points in a 0\xe2\x80\x935 km outside reserve buffer and 9.36 percentage points in a 5\xe2\x80\x9310 km outside reserve buffer, indicating a significant inhibitory effect of the nature reserves on the loss of natural forests. 2) Natural forests coverage dropped in 60% of the studied nature reserves during the 20-year period, suggesting a poor protection effectiveness of these reserves, while the coverage proportion showed some increase (0%/yr\xe2\x80\x935%/yr) in other reserves. 3) Expansion of rubber and pulp forests as part of a booming economy were the main factors affecting the effectiveness of the nature reserves for conserving natural forests in Hainan Province. The results of this study provide an important empirical basis for the protection of natural forests in Hainan Province, which can be used as a blueprint for nature reserve evaluation in other places in China.'

Abstract: 'In Central Africa, important carbon stocks are stored in natural forest stands, while activities that modify the carbon storage occur in the forest landscape. Besides clean development mechanisms, the reduction of emission through deforestation and degradation (REDD) initiative is viewed as one way to mitigate climate change. Important forest habitat protection activities have already been implemented with the aim of conserving the biodiversity of the region in a sustainable manner. The main causes of land use changes in the region are small holder subsistence practices and logging activities. Agricultural production has low productivity levels and therefore investments in improved agricultural techniques can both reduce pressure on existing forests and perhaps allow for the reforestation of existing degraded lands. The logging industry is dominated by large, industrial scale, logging operations performing selective logging of specific species and large trees. The adoption of improved forest management practices can reduce the impact of such logging on the ecological integrity and carbon stocks. Some efforts to engage in the carbon market have begun in the region. Further research is needed into the types of projects that will most likely become successful in the region and what locations will offer the greatest benefits.'

Abstract: 'Colombian Andean forests cover nine million ha. These forests provide an informative case study of mountain deforestation in South America. They are surrounded by tropical lowland forests, and they host most of the country\xe2\x80\x99s human population. This study evaluates the relative importance of human and natural variables in deforestation of the Colombian Andes between 1985 and 2005 using remote sensing methods, geographic information system (GIS) technology and general linear models (GLM). The following factors affected the annual deforestation in the region positively: forced population migration, unsatisfied basic needs, economic activity, crops, pastures, illicit crops, protected areas and slope. Factors having a negative effect were tenure of small land parcels, road density, water scarcity and mean temperature. The results of this study also provide insight into the differences between the dynamics of lowland forests and those of montane forests. Montane forests had a lower annual rate of deforestation than did forests in the lowlands. Socio-economic, demographic and biophysical factors explain overall deforestation rates for the region. However, when altitude variation is taken into account, intraregional differences in the Andes become evident. Deforestation processes differ between those areas adjacent to the high Andean valleys where most of the country\xe2\x80\x99s population concentrates and those areas in the tropical lowlands north, west and east of the Andean chain. Differences between lowland and montane forest dynamics are due partly to the accessibility of forests and differences in wealth and economic activities. In montane forests, deforestation is positively influenced by economic activity, the presence of protected areas and higher slopes. Deforestation in montane forests is negatively affected by tenure of small land parcels, road density, water scarcity and mean temperature. Lowland deforestation rates are more closely related to rural population, pasture percentage, crops, protected areas and temperature. Our results suggest that montane forests appear to be in a more advanced stage of colonisation and economic development, whereas lowland forests are closer to the colonisation frontier and to rapidly growing colonist populations. This study reinforces the idea that although the most common tropical drivers of deforestation are found in the Andes, these drivers operate differently when intraregional differences are considered.'

Abstract: 'Wood decay associated with wounding in 40 trees of Parashorea malaanonan growing in Ulu Segama Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia, was estimated 7 years after logging in compartments where reduced-impact (RIL) or conventional (CL) logging methods were used. Trees of \xe2\x89\xa530 cm diameter were felled and dissected to determine the volume of log occupied by decay. Scrapes were the most common types of wounds sampled, followed by basal wounds, broken tops or branches and butt log wounds. All wounded trees examined had decay, whereas only 25% of trees \xc3\x9730 cm diameter at breast height of this species in the reserve typically had stem decay. Median defect to gross volume of tree was \xe2\x88\xbc5%, and was similar for trees in RIL and CL areas. However, defect volume per wound was greater in trees from CL areas relative to RIL areas, in particular, mid-bole wounds had greater defect volume in trees in CL areas as opposed to trees in RIL areas. The mean rate of decay was estimated at 68 cm3 of timber per year for each cm2 of wound area. Defect volume was positively correlated with wound size but was unrelated to tree size. P. malaanonan is vulnerable to wood decay following wounding; therefore, in eastern Sabah forests, where this species comprises a large proportion of the commercial volume, efforts to reduce incidental damage to residual stems during harvesting operations are an important component in protecting the growing stock.'

Abstract: 'Automatic fire detection system is a system that is capable of assessing environmental factors and their effects on the environment as well as predicting the occurrence of fire in the early stages and even before the outbreak. There are two perspectives in fire detection: fire detection in forests or jungles and fire detection in occupied or residential areas. Automatic fire detection has attracted increased attention due to its importance in decreasing fire damage. There are many studies that have considered appropriate techniques for early fire detection. In recent years researches have been studying technical developments in this field aimed at exploiting wireless communications networks, detection systems and fire prediction systems design. In this paper the automatic fire detection researches using intelligent techniques from 2000 to 2010 is reviewed. We could classify researches to four categories: fire detectors, reduce false alarms systems, fire data analysis and fire predictors. We also classify the intelligent techniques outlined in the researches for each category.'

Abstract: ' Adaptation of forest management to climate change requires an understanding of the effects of climate on forests, industries and communities; prediction of how these effects might change over time; and incorporation of this knowledge into management decisions. This requires multiple forms of knowledge and new approaches to forest management decisions. Partnerships that integrate researchers from multiple disciplines with forest managers and local actors can build a shared understanding of future challenges and facilitate improved decision making in the face of climate change.

Abstract: 'The structure of the Atlantic Forest (AF) has been studied for almost 70\xc2\xa0years. However, the related existing knowledge is spread over hundreds of documents, many of them unpublished and/or difficult to access. Synthesis initiatives are available, but they are restricted to only a few parts or types of the AF or are focused on species occurrence. Here, we conducted an extensive review to compile quantitative tree community surveys on all types of the AF until 2013 and to study where and how these surveys were conducted. We found 1157 relevant references, containing 2441 forest surveys published since 1945. These surveys corresponded to 2.24 million trees and 1817\xc2\xa0ha of forests sampled. This total sampled area represents only 0.01\xc2\xa0% of the AF remnants, showing how limited our knowledge is on AF structure. For Paraguay and the Brazilian states of Bahia and Mato Grosso do Sul this proportion was much smaller. The same was true for evergreen rainforests, Brejos de altitude and deciduous forests and most probably for the rare cloud, swamp, Caxetal and Mussununga forests for which no accurate remnant estimates were found. Since the 1980s, the amount of AF area sampled each year has increased continuously, but approximately 100\xc2\xa0years will be necessary to sample at least 1\xc2\xa0% of the AF. Thus, we urgently need an enormous amount of high-quality quantitative data to overcome our limited knowledge of the AF and to support conservation programs aiming to safeguard this threatened biodiversity hotspot.'

Abstract: 'Cai\xc3\xa7aras are inhabitants of the Atlantic Forest coast in SE Brazil. We studied the uses of plants by five Cai\xc3\xa7ara communities and compared medicinal plant citations by informants in coastal and island communities. We use diversity indices to evaluate the use of plants and to compare communities. There is a high diversity of plants used in the Atlantic Forest coasts: we found 276 species used for food, medicine and construction. Cai\xc3\xa7aras rely on folk medicine, and medicinal plants were especially cited in interviews. Following predictions of island biogeography theory, we found a lower diversity of medicinal plants cited in islands compared to continental communities.'

Abstract: 'Shoot elongation of Hancornia speciosa, an endangered tree from the Brazilian savannah \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d, is very slow, thus limiting nursery production of plants. Gibberellins (GAs) A1, A3, and A5, and two inhibitors of GA biosynthesis, trinexapac-ethyl and ancymidol were applied to shoots of Hancornia seedlings. GA1 and GA3 significantly stimulated shoot elongation, while GA5 had no significant effect. Trinexapac-ethyl and ancymidol, both at 100\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g per seedling, inhibited shoot elongation up to 45\xc2\xa0days after treatment, though the effect was statistically significant only for ancymidol. Somewhat surprisingly, exogenous GA3 more effectively stimulated shoot elongation in SD-grown plants, than in LD-grown plants. The results from exogenous application of GAs and inhibitors of GA biosynthesis imply that Hancornia shoot growth is controlled by GAs, and that level of endogenous growth-active GAs is likely to be the limiting factor for shoot elongation in Hancornia. Application of GAs thus offer a practical method for nursery production of Hancornia seedlings for outplanting into the field.'

Abstract: "Air samples collected on St. John in the U.S.Virgin Islands were screened for the presenceof viable bacteria and fungi to determine ifthe number of cultivatable microbes in theatmosphere differed between ``clear atmosphericconditions'' and ``African dust-events.'' Resultsindicate that during ``African dust-events,'' thenumbers of cultivatable airborne microorganismscan be 2 to 3 times that found during ``clearatmospheric conditions.'' Direct microbialcounts of air samples using an epifluorescentmicroscopy assay demonstrated that during an``African dust-event,'' bacteria-like andvirus-like particle counts were approximatelyone log greater than during ``clear atmosphericconditions.'' Bacteria-like particles exhibitingautofluoresence, a trait of phototrophs, wereonly detected during an ``African dust-event.''"

Abstract: 'This study was conducted in the Knuckles Forest Region in central Sri Lanka, and investigated how termite species richness, abundance and functional group diversity vary in different montane forest types and identified the likely causes of this pattern. Termite diversity declined with increased elevation, with upper montane forests recording a single endemic species, Postelectrotermes militaris Desneux. Transect sampling in lower montane forests yielded 26 species, with a higher number from dry forests (22 species) than from wet forests (15 species). Species specificity also was high in dry forests (11 species) compared with wet forests (four species). Termite abundance did not show a distinct trend in dry and wet forests. Live-wood termites were present only in upper montane and high-altitude lower montane dry forests. Wet forests had a higher relative abundance (78%) but not species richness (40%) of soil and soil-wood interface feeders. In dry forests, both species richness (82%) and abundance (88%) of fungus-growing wood feeders were higher. The study suggests that key drivers of the species distribution pattern are low temperature and differing forest floor conditions. In the upper montane forest floor where earthworms dominate, wet soil and damp, woody litter riddled with beetles are not favourable for termites. In lower montane wet forests, moist, thick decomposing leaf litter and in dry forests, drier, relatively undecomposed leaf litter with many dry sticks and branches support species with specific food habits.'

Abstract: 'The distinction between lineages of neotropical bats from the Pteronotus parnellii species complex has been previously made according to mitochondrial DNA, and especially morphology and acoustics, in order to separate them into two species. In these studies, either sample sizes were too low when genetic and acoustic or morphological data were gathered on the same individuals, or genetic and other data were collected on different individuals. In this study, we intensively sampled bats in 4 caves and combined all approaches in order to analyse genetic, morphologic, and acoustic divergence between these lineages that live in the same caves in French Guiana.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is considered one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most important sites for biodiversity conservation, and within this biome there are regions with differing levels of species richness, species composition, and endemism. The present study was undertaken in southern Bahia, Brazil, and employed a standardized sampling method to compare the density of arboreal species in this region with other areas throughout the world known for their high tree species density. A total of 144 tree species with DBH\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa04.8\xc2\xa0cm were sampled within a 0.1\xc2\xa0ha plot of old-growth forest (OGF), and these data were then compared with 22 other world sites that had been sampled using the same methodology and likewise demonstrated high densities of arboreal species. Only one site of ombrophilous forest in Colombia demonstrated a higher tree species density (148 spp. in 0.1\xc2\xa0ha) than was encountered in southern Bahia. Other areas of Brazil, including other Atlantic Forest sites, showed significantly inferior tree species densities. These results indicate that this region of southern Bahia has one of the greatest numbers of tree species in Brazil and in the world. These results, associated with the high levels of endemism there, indicate the high biological importance of this region. It is therefore fundamental that efforts aimed at halting the degradation of these forests be linked to programs that will increase our knowledge of the species found there as well as the ecological and evolutionary processes that originated these unique forests.'

Abstract: 'Homegardens in an upland forest area in the Kwata-Laranjal indigenous territory (state of Amazonas, central Amazonia) were studied to assess how their management contributes to soil fertility. The characteristics of the homegarden soil were compared with those of adjacent primary and secondary forest, at soil depth of 0\xe2\x80\x9310, 10\xe2\x80\x9320 and 20\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0cm. Significant homegarden effects were observed, which raised pH (H2O) (4.3\xe2\x80\x934.4 at 0\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0cm) and phosphorus content (5\xe2\x80\x9314\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 at 0\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0cm); and decreased the content of calcium (0.1\xc2\xa0cmolc kg\xe2\x88\x921 at 20\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0cm). At the same time, levels observed in homegardens for aluminum (3.0\xe2\x80\x933.2\xc2\xa0cmolc\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921), organic carbon (11\xe2\x80\x9313\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921), calcium (0.24\xe2\x80\x930.38 cmolc kg\xe2\x88\x921 at 0\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0cm), magnesium (0.08\xe2\x80\x930.20 cmolc\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921) and potassium (0.06\xe2\x80\x930.10 cmolc\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921) were not significantly different from those of primary and secondary forest. These results indicate that the management of these homegardens contributes to maintain or increase soil fertility. However, feasible management options to increase the content of these soils in carbon, calcium, magnesium and potassium are highly desirable.'

Abstract: 'Methane (CH4) is the most important greenhouse gas and reactive trace gas in the atmosphere. Recently, it has been reported that terrestrial plants can emit CH4 under aerobic conditions, which may call for reevaluation of the inventory of CH4 emissions in China. In this paper, those emissions over China and their effects on CH4 concentrations in lower troposphere were investigated. Firstly, based on the work of Keppler et al., the aerobic plant CH4 emission model (PLANTCH4) for China was established. And by using the database of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from NOAA/AVHRR, the distribution of net primary productivity (NPP) over China was simulated, and thereby, for the first time, the amount and distribution of the newly identified source in China were estimated. Secondly, with the aid of the three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry model system (MM5-CALGRID), the effects of the emissions were studied. The results show that the annual aerobic plant CH4 emissions over China amount to 11.83 Tg, i.e. nearly 24% of Chinese total CH4 emissions. And the major fraction (about 43%) comes from forests. When those emissions are considered in modeling, computed countrywide mean surface concentration of CH4 is 29.9% higher than without them, with a maximum increase of 69.61 \xce\xbcg\xc2\xb7m\xe2\x88\x923 in the south of Yunnan Province. In conclusion, to study CH4 emissions from terrestrial plants over China may have important implications for correctly estimating the contribution of China to global CH4 budget, and may call for a reconsideration of the role of CH4 in global and regional environment and climate change.'

Abstract: 'Temporal and spatial scales of disturbance and recovery are often confounded in discussions of landscape equilibrium. We developed a broad framework for the description of landscapes that separates the spatial and temporal scales of disturbance and recovery and predicts the resultant dynamics of a landscape. Two key parameters representing time and space are used to describe potential disturbance dynamics. The temporal parameter, T, is the ratio of the disturbance interval (i.e., time between successive disturbance events) to the time required for a disturbed site to recover to a mature stage. The spatial parameter, S, is the ratio of the size of the disturbance to the size of the landscape. The use of ratios in both parameters permits the comparison of landscapes across a range of spatial and temporal scales. A simple simulation model was developed to explore the implications of various combinations of S and T. For any single simulation, disturbances of a fixed size are imposed at random locations on a gridded landscape at specified intervals. Disturbed sites recover deterministically through succession. Where disturbance interval is long relative to recovery time and a small proportion of the landscape is affected, the system is stable and exhibits low variance over time (e.g., northeastern hardwood forests). These are traditional \xe2\x80\x9cequilibrium\xe2\x80\x9d systems. Where disturbance interval is comparable to recovery interval and a large proportion of the landscape is affected, the system is stable but exhibits large variance (e.g., subalpine forests in Yellowstone Park). Where disturbance interval becomes much shorter than recovery time and a large proportion of the landscape is affected, the system may become unstable and shift into a different trajectory (e.g., arid ecosystems with altered fire regimes). This framework permits the prediction of disturbance conditions that lead to qualitatively different landscape dynamics and demonstrates the scale-dependent nature of concepts of landscape equilibrium.'

Abstract: 'Particularly since the emergence of modern stock markets, investment frauds based on hyped or completely phony claims have been sufficient to cause concern. However those involving precious metals seem in a category by themselves. Partly no doubt that is because such schemes routinely promise fantastic returns; partly, too, it is because precious metals have a special lure based on myth, magic or even atavistic religious appeal which con artists exploit. However it is often difficult with precious metal mines to know precisely where over-enthusiasm by promoters ends and outright fraud against investors begins. Unlike with base metals, it is commercially feasible to mine precious ones at very low concentrations; while the speculative nature of most new mining ventures makes failure for legitimate reasons a frequent occurrence, helping to disguise or at least fudge the distinction between a business venture that went sour and an outright scam. Moreover the geology of sites can be tricky even for experts to read; assay results are far from conclusive in many instances; and the technologies employed are often changing with the result that what might have seemed an impossibility one day becomes at least arguable the next. All this combines with short memories and the lure of potentially very high returns to make investment in the precious metals sector as much today as in the past treacherous not just for novices but even for experienced investors. This paper examines the nature of such investment frauds in light of history, technology and geological uncertainty, and suggests reasons to expect no significant change in the foreseeable future.'

Abstract: 'Climate change will have significant impacts on vegetation and biodiversity. Solar geoengineering has potential to reduce the climate effects of greenhouse gas emissions through albedo modification, yet more research is needed to better understand how these techniques might impact terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we utilize the fully coupled version of the Community Earth System Model to run transient solar geoengineering simulations designed to stabilize radiative forcing starting mid-century, relative to the Representative Concentration Pathway 6 (RCP6) scenario. Using results from 100-year simulations, we analyze model output through the lens of ecosystem-relevant metrics. We find that solar geoengineering improves the conservation outlook under climate change, but there are still potential impacts on terrestrial vegetation. We show that rates of warming and the climate velocity of temperature are minimized globally under solar geoengineering by the end of the century, while trends persist over land in the Northern Hemisphere. Moisture is an additional constraint on vegetation, and in the tropics the climate velocity of precipitation dominates over that of temperature. Shifts in the amplitude of temperature and precipitation seasonal cycles have implications for vegetation phenology. Different metrics for vegetation productivity also show decreases under solar geoengineering relative to RCP6, but could be related to the model parameterization of nutrient cycling. The coupling of water and carbon cycles is found to be an important mechanism for understanding changes in ecosystems under solar geoengineering.'

Abstract: ' Hevea brasiliensis is a commercially cultivated species for its natural rubber (NR) latex in South East Asian countries. To meet the ever-increasing demand, NR cultivation has been extended to non-traditional regions due to the limited scope of further expansion in traditional rubber-growing areas in India. These areas are often confronted with various abiotic stresses, especially high and low temperatures, which cause reduction in plant growth, thereby increasing its uneconomical immaturity period. Eighteen wild Hevea accessions along with two modern clones RRII 203 and PB 235 and two check clones RRIM 600 and Haiken 1 were evaluated in the early mature growth phase. The site was at Nagrakata, West Bengal, the sub-Himalayan cold-prone region of India. In Hevea, crop production is governed by two major factors, growth-vigor and production capacity. Growth-vigor is of special importance because the production of rubber is a process linked with the early growth of the plant, which results in early tappability and early economic gains. The genotypes exhibited highly significant clonal differences (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.05) for all the growth traits. Tappability percentage in the seventh year, ranged from 0.33\xc2\xa0% (AC 3074, AC 3075, AC 3293) to 89.67\xc2\xa0% (RO 2727). The most vigorously growing accession (RO 2727) reached tappabile girth early in the seventh year when the girth of plant ranged from 22.38\xc2\xa0cm (AC 3293) to 53.12\xc2\xa0cm (RO 2727). The general mean was 43.32\xc2\xa0cm, and the similar growth trend was exhibited by these accessions in the tenth year also. Annual girth increment (cm\xc2\xa0a\xe2\x88\x921) over 3\xc2\xa0years ranged from 1.81\xc2\xa0cm (AC 3075) to 6.80\xc2\xa0cm (RO 2727). The mean winter girth increment (cm\xc2\xa0a\xe2\x88\x921) over 4\xc2\xa0years ranged from 0.13\xc2\xa0cm (AC 3075) to 0.96\xc2\xa0cm (RO 2727) as compared to the check clone RRIM 600 (1.11\xc2\xa0cm) and Haiken 1 (1.10\xc2\xa0cm). Wide differences between the phenotypic coefficient of variation (50.29) and genotypic coefficient of variation (24.82) were observed for winter girth increment. Girth in the tenth year recorded the highest heritability (87\xc2\xa0%). Girth was significantly correlated with the other growth traits. The top 30\xc2\xa0% of the potential accessions showing high growth vigour and early tappability under cold stress were identified. These ecotypes/selections have high potential value for the development of cold-tolerant clones for these regions and also in broadening the genetic base of the present-day cultivated rubber.'

Abstract: 'Remnant trees may play an important role in conserving biodiversity within agricultural systems because they provide habitats and resources that are otherwise absent from agricultural landscapes. In order to determine the potential importance of remnant trees for conservation, we surveyed the density and species composition of remnant trees occurring in pastures of 24 dairy farms near Monteverde, Costa Rica. In addition, we conducted interviews with farmers to determine why they leave trees in pastures and how they manage them. In our survey of 237 ha of pastures, we counted 5583 trees of 190 species (mean density of 25 trees/ha). Primary forest trees accounted for 57% of all of the species and 33% of tree individuals. Over 90% of the species are known to provide food for forest birds and other animals. In addition, many of the species are important locally for humans as sources of timber (37%), firewood (36%) or fence posts (20%). Farmers mentioned 19 reasons for leaving trees in pastures. Of these, shade for cattle, timber, fruits for birds and fence posts were most commonly cited. Most farmers were well aware of both the economic and ecological benefits of pasture trees, and were interested in the possibility of increasing tree cover within their pastures. Although the current densities and richness of pasture trees in Monteverde are high, the size distribution indicates that diversity will decrease substantially in future years, both because farmers are harvesting trees and because saplings of primary forest trees are scarce within the pastures.'

Abstract: 'Landsat 7\xe2\x80\x99s recent malfunctioning will result in significant gaps in long-term satellite monitoring of Earth, affecting not only the research of the Earth science community but also conservation users of these data. To determine whether or how important Landsat monitoring is for conservation and natural resource management, we reviewed the Landsat program\xe2\x80\x99s history with special emphasis on the development of user groups. We also conducted a bibliographic search to determine the extent to which conservation research has been based on Landsat data. Conservation biologists were not an early user group of Landsat data because a) biologists lacked technical capacity \xe2\x80\x93 computers and software \xe2\x80\x93 to analyze these data; b) Landsat\xe2\x80\x99s 1980s commercialization rendered images too costly for biologists\xe2\x80\x99 budgets; and c) the broad-scale disciplines of conservation biology and landscape ecology did not develop until the mid-to-late 1980s. All these conditions had changed by the 1990s and Landsat imagery became an important tool for conservation biology. Satellite monitoring and Landsat continuity are mandated by the Land Remote Sensing Act of 1992. This legislation leaves open commercial options. However, past experiments with commercial operations were neither viable nor economical, and severely reduced the quality of monitoring, archiving and data access for academia and the public. Future satellite monitoring programs are essential for conservation and natural resource management, must provide continuity with Landsat, and should be government operated.'

Abstract: 'This paper reviews current techniques on rainfall estimation from satellite sensor observations. The sensors considered in this study are the Precipitation Radar (PR) and radiometer (TMI) onboard TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Missio) satellite, the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) onboard Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms, and infrared (IR) sensors onboard geostationary satellites. We present the physical basis and mathematical formulation of a newly developed combined radar-radiometer (PR/TMI) retrieval for TRMM and its application for overland rain estimation. Subsequently we discuss the current state-of-the-art in overland passive microwave (TMI and SSM/I) rain estimation techniques, and outstanding issues associated with the inverse problem. The significance of lightning information in advancing high-frequency rainfall estimation from passive microwave-calibrated IR retrieval techniques is discussed on the basis of newly developed techniques. Finally, current approaches are presented on merging the infrequent passive microwave-based rainfall estimates with the high-frequency, but lower accuracy, rainfall fields derived from proxy parameters (e.g., lightning and IR). The paper provides useful insights on satellite rainfall estimation and discusses issues and applications.'

Abstract: 'Keystone species are organisms, usually animals of higher trophic levels, that have large ecological impacts relative to their abundance. A recent extension of this concept recognizes hyperkeystone species, such as humans, which affect other keystone species and often play a key role in multiple ecosystem dynamics. Following a systematic review, we propose that the Neotropical palm species Mauritia flexuosa, though abundant locally, plays a role resembling that of a hyperkeystone species. First, it provides multiple types of key plant resources (food, nest sites, habitat) to a wide variety of species (at least 940 vertebrate species). Of vertebrates that directly use this palm as a food or nest resource (at least 74), at least 8 highly dependent on it for survival, 28 are threatened species, and at least 19 are keystone species themselves. This implies that a change in the abundance or distribution of Mauritia flexuosa is likely to have multiple cascading effects on Neotropical ecosystems. In addition, we highlight that this palm is also important for many invertebrates and other organisms and provides multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration. This vast ecological role of M. flexuosa, combined with its provision of a host of products to people, makes the species unique and worth prioritizing in conservation and plans for sustainable management across the Neotropics.'

Abstract: "Native food production in the Eastern Woodlands of North America before, and at the time of, European contact has been described by several writers as \xe2\x80\x9cslash-and-burn agriculture,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshifting cultivation,\xe2\x80\x9d and even \xe2\x80\x9cswidden.\xe2\x80\x9d Select quotes from various early explorers, such as John Smith of Pocahontas fame, have been used out of context to support this position. Solid archaeological evidence of such practices is next to non-existent, as are ethnographic parallels from the region. In reality, the best data are documentary. Unlike previous assessments, this paper evaluates sixteenth and seventeenth century ethnohistorical references to anything that can be even remotely construed as supportive of previous claims. Analyzed as a group these sources reveal something completely different from what common knowledge would have us believe. References to the slashing, the burning, and the shifting of fields are reasonably abundant. Rarely, however, are all three activities mentioned in a single passage, or by one chronicler. Furthermore, subtleties often overlooked in these quotes reveal great insight into native practices. This paper assesses explorers' and early settlers' descriptions in the context of the larger body of literature dealing with the ecology of swidden agriculture today. Indigenous fields in the Eastern Woodlands tended to be large, numerous, contiguous, and cleared of roots and stumps. Fields previously cleared of trees were covered with grass prior to preparation for planting. They were permanently cultivated. This condition stands in marked contrast to present-day swidden fields in other parts of the world that tend to be small, few, scattered, partially cleared of trees, and cultivated for only a year or two before being abandoned. Slash-and-burn shifting cultivation became common only after European settlers introduced steel axes. It was then practiced on uplands, not the formerly cultivated floodplains that were usurped by interlopers."

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Savanna is considered a global hotspot and habitat loss has posed a serious threat to insect fauna, including Hymenoptera parasitoids. We tested the effect of fragment size, seasonal abundance, and vegetation structure, on Hymenopteran community composition. This is the first study that describes the Hymenoptera community at the morphospecies level for the Brazilian Savanna. No relationship between community structure and fragment size was found. Instead, variation in individual abundance was higher with low rainfall and temperature. It was possible to identify two groups, with different compositions. One group was influenced by leaf-litter and the shrub layer, whilst the other had an affinity with vertical variables and the arboreal stratum. In the Brazilian Savanna, the Hymenopteran fauna is not well known and the effect of fragmentation and habitat structure are important factors for the structure and composition of the Hymenopteran community. Savanna, with its high biodiversity, confirms this biogeographical region as a hotspot for Hymenoptera. We can conclude from the results of this study that seasonality, spatial arrangement, and variations in the structural complexity of fragments affects the composition and distribution of Hymenoptera in the Brazilian Savanna biome.\n'

Abstract: 'The UN\xe2\x80\x99s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other regional and national policy commitments have motivated an upsurge of interest in concepts and practical methods for monitoring forest conditions and trends at very wide geographic scales. Two approaches to sustainability assessment at a global level are reviewed here. One consists of monitoring change in forest conditions over time\xe2\x80\x94the so-called Criteria and Indicators (C&I) approach. Another approach compares nations at a given point in time. An example is the Yale Environmental Performance Index (EPI). Both approaches yield insights. It is widely recognized, though, that severe data weaknesses afflict forest information over much of the world. These weaknesses include weak or absent information on wood consumption in many regions, poor area estimates, and weak or absent information on key ecological conditions in forests. The purpose of this essay is to introduce these efforts at global assessment, and to argue that an entirely new discipline is needed to supply the information needed. The focus of this new discipline would be to design an ecologically based set of definitions for forest and related ecosystems, and then to build and implement the optimum combination of satellite measurements, air photo interpretation, and field plot measurements needed to measure world forest resource conditions and trends. Examples of this new approach are already appearing. This argument is addressed to members of the global forest policy community concerned with assessment, and to scientists, technologists, and managers in the many technical fields already engaged on one or another aspect of measuring and monitoring forest conditions at a national and regional scale.'

Abstract: 'Human actions drive landscape heterogeneity, yet most ecosystem classifications omit the role of human influence. This study explores land use history to inform a classification of forestland of the Tayal Mrqwang indigenous people of Taiwan. Our objectives were to determine the extent to which human action drives landscape heterogeneity. We used interviews, field sampling, and multivariate analysis to relate vegetation patterns to environmental gradients and human modification across 76 sites. We identified eleven forest classes. In total, around 70\xc2\xa0% of plots were at lower elevations and\xc2\xa0had a history of shifting cultivation, terrace farming, and settlement that resulted in alder, laurel, oak, pine, and bamboo stands. Higher elevation mixed conifer forests were least disturbed. Arboriculture and selective harvesting were drivers of other conspicuous forest patterns. The findings show that past land uses play a key role in shaping forests, which is important to consider when setting targets to guide forest management.'

Abstract: 'Arthropod assemblages were examined in Lama forest reserve, a protected area situated in the Dahomey gap, southern Benin, composed of plantations, degraded forest and remnants of natural forest. The objectives were to compare assemblages in relation to forest type and use, to elucidate the value of forest plantations for biodiversity conservation and to identify indicator species for specific forest habitats. Arthropods were collected over an 11-month period, using standardized sets of traps (pitfall, emergence, Malaise and flight intercept traps). Nine different habitats were studied, including natural and degraded forest, forest plantations (Tectona grandis and Senna siamea) of different age, and isolated forest fragments. Our analysis focused on detritivorous and xylophagous arthropods but also included ground beetles and heteropterans, totalling 393 species. We found no differences in species richness among natural and degraded forest habitats in the centre of the reserve (Noyau central). Outside of the Noyau central, species richness was highest in old teak plantations and isolated forest fragments and lowest in young teak and fuelwood plantations. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) separated three main groups: (1) natural forest, (2) degraded forest and young plantations, and (3) old plantations and isolated forest fragments. Multiple regression of DCA scores of the first two axes on environmental variables identified one natural and three disturbance-related predictors of arthropod assemblages in Lama forest: soil type (texture), canopy height, naturalness (proportion of Guineo-Congolian plant species) and understorey vegetation cover. We identified 15 indicator species for six different forest habitats. The highest numbers were found in abandoned settlements and old teak plantations. \xce\xb2-diversity was similar among the three DCA ordination groups (degraded forest excluded). Values for \xce\xb2-diversity were relatively high, suggesting that all major forest habitats contribute significantly to regional species pools and should therefore be protected. To enhance arthropod diversity, we propose that management practices in Lama forest should aim to encourage the development of species-rich understorey vegetation of the Guineo-Congolian phytogeographical region.'

Abstract: 'This study in the wake of 1990s fire catastrophes identifies and analyzes underlying causes of vegetation fires in eight locations across Borneo and Sumatra. Multidisciplinary and multiscale analysis integrates geospatial technologies with varied social research approaches and participatory mapping. It helps fill a void of site-specific evidence on diverse underlying causes of the Indonesian fires, despite emerging consensus on macrolevel causes and impacts, and policy debates on preventing future fire disasters. Our most important findings include confirmation of multiple direct and underlying fire causes at each of the eight locations, no single dominant fire cause at any site, and wide differences in fire causes among sites. Conclusions emphasize the importance of location specific studies within a regional analytical context. Our \xe2\x80\x9chybrid\xe2\x80\x9d research methods demonstrate the explanatory power of integrating geospatial and social analysis techniques, and the benefits of analyzing fire causes and impacts at multiple scales in varied locations across diverse regions.'

Abstract: 'Land surface phenology is widely retrieved from satellite observations at regional and global scales, and its long-term record has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for reconstructing past climate variations, monitoring the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in response to climate impacts, and predicting biological responses to future climate scenarios. This study detected global land surface phenology from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 1982 to 2010. Based on daily enhanced vegetation index at a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees, we simulated the seasonal vegetative trajectory for each individual pixel using piecewise logistic models, which was then used to detect the onset of greenness increase (OGI) and the length of vegetation growing season (GSL). Further, both overall interannual variations and pixel-based trends were examined across Koeppen\xe2\x80\x99s climate regions for the periods of 1982\xe2\x80\x931999 and 2000\xe2\x80\x932010, respectively. The results show that OGI and GSL varied considerably during 1982\xe2\x80\x932010 across the globe. Generally, the interannual variation could be more than a month in precipitation-controlled tropical and dry climates while it was mainly less than 15\xc2\xa0days in temperature-controlled temperate, cold, and polar climates. OGI, overall, shifted early, and GSL was prolonged from 1982 to 2010 in most climate regions in North America and Asia while the consistently significant trends only occurred in cold climate and polar climate in North America. The overall trends in Europe were generally insignificant. Over South America, late OGI was consistent (particularly from 1982 to 1999) while either positive or negative GSL trends in a climate region were mostly reversed between the periods of 1982\xe2\x80\x931999 and 2000\xe2\x80\x932010. In the Northern Hemisphere of Africa, OGI trends were mostly insignificant, but prolonged GSL was evident over individual climate regions during the last 3 decades. OGI mainly showed late trends in the Southern Hemisphere of Africa while GSL was reversed from reduced GSL trends (1982\xe2\x80\x931999) to prolonged trends (2000\xe2\x80\x932010). In Australia, GSL exhibited considerable interannual variation, but the consistent trend lacked presence in most regions. Finally, the proportion of pixels with significant trends was less than 1\xc2\xa0% in most of climate regions although it could be as large as 10\xc2\xa0%.'

Abstract: 'Human activities have more than doubled the inputs of nitrogen (N) into terrestrial systems globally. The sources and distribution of anthropogenic N, including N fertilization and N fixed during fossil fuel combustion, are rapidly shifting from the temperate zone to a more global distribution. The consequences of anthropogenic N deposition for ecosystem processes and N losses have been studied primarily in N-limited ecosystems in the temperate zone; there is reason to expect that tropical ecosystems, where plant growth is most often limited by some other resource, will respond differently to increasing deposition. In this paper, we assess the likely direct and indirect effects of increasing anthropogenic N inputs on tropical ecosytem processes. We conclude that anthropogenic inputs of N into tropical forests are unlikely to increase productivity and may even decrease it due to indirect effects on acidity and the availability of phosphorus and cations. We also suggest that the direct effects of anthropogenic N deposition on N cycling processes will lead to increased fluxes at the soilwater and soil-air interfaces, with little or no lag in response time. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties inherent in this analysis, and outline future research that is needed to address those uncertainties.'

Abstract: 'One of the most extreme freshwater habitats in Peninsular Malaysia is the peat swamp forest, with dark-coloured and highly acidic waters. Surprisingly, little is known about blackwater fishes in Peninsular Malaysia. Until 1968, only 26 fish species were known from blackwaters throughout Peninsular Malaysia, of which only one can be regarded as stenotopic. A recent intensive survey of part of the North Selangor peat swamp forest yielded 47 species, of which 14 are probably stenotopic taxa. These include four undescribed species and several new records for western Peninsular Malaysia. These discoveries are significant in that they include the family Chaudhuriidae which until 1985, was not reported from Sundaic Southeast Asia, and the rare genus Encheloclarias which had not been encountered for over 50 years. The rapid rate of destruction of the peat swamp forest owing to development, forestry and agricultural activities must be halted or slowed significantly to enable the proper zoological surveys and studies to be conducted. Conservation plans and environmental impact assessments based on inadequate sampling and knowledge of species present is acutely dangerous. There are no longer substantial undisturbed blackwater peat swamp forests left in most of Peninsular Malaysia. Conservation of the remaining blackwater biotopes is critically important if extinction of many species, here regarded as economically valuable renewable resources, is to be prevented.'

Abstract: 'According to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) the development of bioindicators is extremely necessary to achieve the conservation targets by 2010, and insects are considered an effective group for this goal. Drosophilids are regarded as potential indicators, although this idea remains untested. Therefore, we followed up a protocol to test the drosophilid potential indicator for human disturbance in the Brazilian Savanna, one of the richest and most threatened tropical biomes in the world. Sampling was undertaken in one urban environment and two biological reserves, representing four habitat types (undisturbed gallery forest, disturbed gallery forest, undisturbed savanna, and urban environment). We examined differences in the drosophilid assemblages among habitat types and used the Indicator Value (IndVal) method to point out the indicator species. We also tested the two-stage indicator validation, a protocol recently proposed in the literature, to validate the indicator species for undisturbed gallery forest and savannas, in independent samples. The assemblage variables varied mainly in undisturbed gallery forests, and reflected changes from an undisturbed to a disturbed stage. The IndVal associated with the two-stage protocol showed reliable characteristic species, which are very helpful for diagnostic surveys. Likewise, species that can detect changes in the habitats were also found. We found a set of indicators, which together may be very efficient for both assessing and reflecting a variety of conditions, improving the confidence of the bioindication system, expanding the taxonomic options for bioindicators, and therefore, contributing to the conservation of this region.'

Abstract: 'In the southern region of Bahia, a large portion of the Atlantic Forest was occupied by the cacao\xe2\x80\x93cabruca system, which is implemented after the complete removal of the understory vegetation without altering the canopy. The objective of this study was to determine the nitrogen concentration in the soil solution in two micro-basins; one with the cacao\xe2\x80\x93cabruca system and one in the Atlantic forest in the southern region of the state of Bahia. Samples were collected weekly during two periods, from September to December 2012 and from April to June 2013, using sample extractors installed in the micro-basins at 15, 45 and 90\xc2\xa0cm. The inorganic forms in the soil solutions were analyzed through ion chromatography, total nitrogen was analyzed using spectrophotometry and mineralization and nitrification rates were analyzed using the laboratory incubation method. Among the nitrogen forms analyzed in the cacao\xe2\x80\x93cabruca soil solution, the dissolved organic nitrogen prevailed among the rain classes in the three depths. In the forest, nitrate predominated at 15\xc2\xa0cm, while the organic nitrogen prevailed in the other depths. The highest mineralization and nitrification rates were recorded in the forest. Of the inorganic nitrogen forms analyzed in the soil, ammonium concentrations showed higher rates than nitrate in both areas. Low inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the cabruca soil solution are associated with low mineralization and nitrification rates. Thus we can conclude that even if some studies point towards the environmental efficiency of this system, there are differences in the N forms in the forest and cacao\xe2\x80\x93cabruca areas.'

Abstract: 'Squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp.) are the most commonly used neotropical (platyrrhine) monkeys in biomedical research; however, no consensus exists as to the phylogenetic relationships amongst geographic variants or whether these variants represent species or subspecies. Here we report a strongly supported squirrel monkey phylogeny, congruent across multiple data sets, including new field data and the first molecular (mtDNA) cladogram. These data support species-level classification for the three major groups in this study. Approximately the same amount of molecular divergence exists among Saimiri oerstedii, S. sciureus, and S. boliviensis. The S. sciureus/S. oerstedii ancestor diverged from S. boliviensis and shortly thereafter S. sciureus and S. oerstedii diverged. Until now, lack of a robust taxonomy has hindered exploitation of the massive potential of Saimiri for comparative studies. No other primate genus displays such widely divergent, genetically-based social behaviors. Our taxonomy also provides robust support for previous warnings against the widespread use of hybrid squirrel monkeys as research models.'

Abstract: 'The paper reviews a number of challenges associated with reducing degradation and its related emissions through national approaches to REDD+ under UNFCCC policy. It proposes that in many countries, it may in the short run be easier to deal with the kinds of degradation that result from locally driven community over-exploitation of forest for livelihoods, than from selective logging or fire control. Such degradation is low-level, but chronic, and is experienced over very large forest areas. Community forest management programmes tend to result not only in reduced degradation, but also in forest enhancement; moreover they are often popular, and do not require major political shifts. In principle these approaches therefore offer a quick start option for REDD+. Developing reference emissions levels for low-level locally driven degradation is difficult however given that stock losses and gains are too small to be identified and measured using remote sensing, and that in most countries there is little or no forest inventory data available. We therefore propose that forest management initiatives at the local level, such as those promoted by community forest management programmes, should monitor, and be credited for, only the net increase in carbon stock over the implementation period, as assessed by ground level surveys at the start and end of the period. This would also resolve the problem of nesting (ensuring that all credits are accounted for against the national reference emission level), since communities and others at the local level would be rewarded only for increased sequestration, while the national reference emission level would deal only with reductions in emissions from deforestation and degradation.'

Abstract: "The potential feedback on global atmospheric and climate change of climate-driven changes in terrestrial vegetation is examined by systematically relating the surface exchanges of energy, mass and momentum to two dimensions of vegetation, structure and taxonomy, such that the significance of climate driven changes in these characteristics can be assessed. A detailed quantitative understanding of this feedback is an important prerequisite to realistic and dynamic representations of the Earth's surface within general circulation and biological models (GCMs and GBMs). Without realistic representations of terrestrial vegetation within these models, any forecasts of future climates by these models must be suspect."

Abstract: 'Two approaches are frequently mentioned in proposals to use tropical forest maintenance as a carbon offset. One is to set up specific reserves, funding the establishment, demarcation, and guarding of these units. Monitoring, in this case, consists of the relatively straightforward process of confirming that the forest stands in question continue to exist. In Amazonia, where large expanses of tropical forest still exist, the reserve approach has the logical weakness of being completely open to \xe2\x80\x9cleakage\xe2\x80\x9d: with the implantation of any given reserve, the people who would have been deforesting in the reserve area will probably continue to clear the same amount of forest somewhere else in the region. The second approach is through policy changes aimed at reducing the rate of clearing, but not limited to specific reserves or areas of forest. This second approach addresses more fundamental aspects of the tropical deforestation problem, but has the disadvantages of not assuring the permanence of forest and of not resulting in a visible product that can be convincingly credited to the existence of the project. In order for credit to be assigned to policy change projects, functioning models of the deforestation process must be developed that are capable of producing scenarios with and without different policy changes. This requires understanding the process of deforestation, which depends on monitoring in order to have information as a time series. Information is needed both from satellite imagery and from on-the-ground observations on who occupies the land and why the observed changes occur. Monitoring must be done by individual property if causal factors are to be identified reliably; this is best achieved using a database in a Geographical Information System (GIS) that includes property boundaries. Once policy changes are made in practice, not only deforestation but also the policies themselves must be monitored. Decrees and laws are not the same as changes in practice; the initiation and continued application of changes must therefore be confirmed regularly. The value of carbon benefits from Amazonia depends directly on the credibility and transparency of monitoring. The great potential value of carbon maintenance in Amazonia should provide ample reason for Amazonian countries to strengthen and increase the transparency of their monitoring efforts.'

Abstract: 'Oilseeds are among the most rapidly expanding of all agricultural crops, and a recent report on global diets1 by CIAT (Centre for Research on Tropical Agriculture) confirms that they have become globally dominant contributors to calorific intake. Moreover, oil crops are also critical for feeding livestock and for the production of biofuels. This book, therefore, covers a most important topic for those interested in food security in its widest sense, and it does so from an interdisciplinary perspective.'

Abstract: 'The myxomycetes (plasmodial slime molds or myxogastrids) are a group of eukaryotic microorganisms usually present and sometimes abundant in terrestrial ecosystems. Evidence from molecular studies suggests that the myxomycetes have a significant evolutionary history. However, due to the fragile nature of the fruiting body, fossil records of the group are exceedingly rare. Although most myxomycetes are thought to have very large distributional ranges and many species appear to be cosmopolitan or nearly so, results from recent studies have provided evidence that spatial distribution patterns of these organisms can be successfully related to (1) differences in climate and/or vegetation on a global scale and (2) the ecological differences that exist for particular habitats on a local scale. A detailed examination of the global distribution of four examples (Barbeyella minutissima, Ceratiomyxa morchella, Leocarpus fragilis and Protophysarum phloiogenum) demonstrates that these species have recognizable distribution patterns in spite of the theoretical ability of their spores to bridge continents.'

Abstract: 'The generalization that plant communities increase in flammability as they age and invariably lead to resilient self-organized landscape mosaics is being increasingly challenged. Plant communities often exhibit rapidly saturating or even hump-shaped age-flammability trajectories and landscapes often display strong non-linear behaviors, abrupt shifts, and self-reinforcing alternative community states. This plethora of fire-landscape interactions calls for a more general model that considers alternative age-flammability rules. We simulated landscape dynamics assuming communities that (1) increase in flammability with age and (2) gain flammability up to a certain age followed by a slight and moderate loss to a constant value. Simulations were run under combinations of ignition frequency and interannual climatic variability. Age-increasing fire probability promoted high resilience to changes in ignition frequency and climatic variability whereas humpbacked-shaped age-flammability led to strong non-linear behaviors. Moderate (20%) reductions in mature compared to peak flammability produced the least resilient behaviors. The relatively non-flammable mature forest matrix intersected by young flammable patches is prone to break up and disintegrate with slight increases in ignition/climate variability causing large-scale shifts in the fire regime because large fires were able to sweep through the more continuous young/flammable landscape. Contrary to the dominant perception, fire suppression in landscapes with positive feedbacks may effectively reduce fire occurrence by allowing less flammable later stage communities composed of longer lived, obligate seeders to replace earlier stages of light demanding, often more flammable resprouters. Conversely, increases in anthropogenic ignitions, a common global trend of many forested regions may, in synergism with increased climate variability, induce abrupt shifts, and large-scale forest degradation.'

Abstract: 'Improvements in remote sensing technologies and the use of geographic information system (GIS), are increasingly allowing us to develop indicators that can be used to monitor and assess ecosystem condition and change at multiple scales. This paper presents global- and regional-level indicators developed by the World Resources Institute and collaborating partners using remote sensing and GIS. Presented as regional and global maps, these spatial indicators are ideal communication tools to raise awareness of the condition of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystems among different audiences. Global and regional spatial indicators not only inform us about the current condition of, and pressures on, ecosystems, but also about the likely capacity of the ecosystem to continue to provide goods and services to future generations. The increasing focus on integrating socio-economic and biological information with remote sensing and GIS technology can only help to further our understanding and capacity to manage ecosystems in a more sustainable manner.'

Abstract: 'Niche differentiation with respect to habitat has been hypothesized to shape patterns of diversity and species distributions in plant communities. African forests have been reported to be relatively less diverse compared to highly diversed regions of the Amazonian or Southeast Asian forests, and might be expected to have less niche differentiation. We examined patterns of structural and floristic differences among five topographically defined habitats for 494 species with stems \xe2\x89\xa51\xc2\xa0cm dbh in a 50-ha plot in Korup National Park, Cameroon. In addition, we tested for species\xe2\x80\x93habitat associations for 272 species (with more than 50 individuals in the plot) using Torus translation randomization tests. Tree density and basal area were lowest in areas with negative convexity, which contained streams or were inundated during rainy periods and highest in moist well-drained habitats. Species composition and diversity varied along the topographical gradient from low flat to ridge top habitats. The low depression and low flat habitats were characterized by high diversity and similar species composition, relative to slopes, high gullies and ridge tops. Sixty-three percent of the species evaluated showed significant positive associations with at least one of the five habitat types. The majority of associations were with low depressions (75 species) and the fewest with ridge tops (8 species). The large number of species\xe2\x80\x93habitat associations and the pronounced contrast between low (valley) and elevated (ridgetop) habitats in the Korup plot shows that niche differentiation with respect to edaphic variables (e.g., soil moisture, nutrients) contributes to local scale tree species distributions and to the maintenance of diversity in African forests.'

Abstract: 'Phylogeographic research has advanced in South America, with increasing efforts on taxa from the dry diagonal biomes. However, the diversification of endemic fauna from the semiarid Caatinga biome in northeastern Brazil is still poorly known. Here we targeted saxicolous lizards of the Tropidurus semitaeniatus species group to better understand the evolutionary history of these endemic taxa and the Caatinga. We estimated a time-calibrated phylogeny for the species group based on two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes and jointly estimated the species limits and species tree within the group. We also devoted a denser phylogeographic sampling of the T. semitaeniatus complex to explore migration patterns, and the spatiotemporal diffusion history to verify a possible role of the S\xc3\xa3o Francisco River as a promoter of differentiation in this saxicolous group of lizards.'

Abstract: 'The role of plants in global climate change discussions is usually considered only in terms of the albedo and sinks/sources of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The main aim of this review article is to summarize the entire impact of vegetation on the climate change. It describes quantitatively the energy balance of vegetated surfaces and the effect of vegetation on the hydrological cycle. The distribution of solar energy in the landscape is dealt with in thermodynamic terms. The role of water and plants in the reduction of temperature gradients is emphasized. Papers dealing with the relationship between changes in the landscape cover and regional climates are reviewed, and the fundamental role of wetlands and forests in water cycling is outlined. Positive examples of restoration of dry landscapes, based on rainwater retention and the recovery of permanent vegetation, are described. It is recommended that the direct role of water and vegetation in cooling, reducing temperature and air pressure gradients should be included into all future recommendations for policymakers made by scientists.'

Abstract: 'Interaction between soil acidity and vegetation phenolic concentration was investigated to identify mechanisms by which forests sustain productivity on extremely acidic, infertile soils. Contrasting soils on well-preserved marine terraces of the \xe2\x80\x9cEcological Staircase\xe2\x80\x99 near Mendocino, CA comprise an extreme edaphic gradient. Pygmy forests of dwarf (< 5m) Mendocino cypress (Cupressus pygmaea), Bolander pine (Pinus contorta var. bolanderi), and Bishop pine (Pinus muricata) are found on the oldest, most acidic soils, and along a gradient that includes three distinct levels of soil acidity, with pH(CaCl2) ranging from 5.0 to 3.0 in the upper mineral soil and from 4.0 to 2.0 in the litter layer where fine roots are concentrated. Mature foliage was collected from five sites on this edaphic gradient. Aqueous methanol extracts of the samples were analyzed for concentrations of total phenols and condensed tannin by the Prussian blue and acidified vanillin assays, respectively. There were significant differences (p<0.05) in foliar condensed tannin and phenolic concentrations within each species and concentrations were inversely related to soil pH, approximately doubling along the gradient. Natural selection for soil-regulated variation in polyphenol concentration is interpreted in the context of plant-litter-soil interactions as an adaptation that permits these conifers to survive in extremely acidic soils.

Abstract: 'The REDD-ALERT (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation from Alternative Land Uses in the Rainforests of the Tropics) project started in 2009 and finished in 2012, and had the aim of evaluating mechanisms that translate international-level agreements into instruments that would help change the behaviour of land users while minimising adverse repercussions on their livelihoods. Findings showed that some developing tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, thus shifting from declining to expanding forests at a national scale. However, in most of these (e.g. Vietnam), a significant part of the recent increase in national forest cover is associated with an increase in importation of food and timber products from abroad, representing leakage of carbon stocks across international borders. Avoiding deforestation and restoring forests will require a mixture of regulatory approaches, emerging market-based instruments, suasive options, and hybrid management measures. Policy analysis and modelling work showed the high degree of complexity at local levels and highlighted the need to take this heterogeneity into account\xe2\x80\x94it is unlikely that there will be a one size fits all approach to make Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) work. Significant progress was made in the quantification of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes following land-use change in the tropics, contributing to narrower confidence intervals on peat-based emissions and their reporting standards. There are indications that there is only a short and relatively small window of opportunity of making REDD+ work\xe2\x80\x94these included the fact that forest-related emissions as a fraction of total global GHG emissions have been decreasing over time due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions, and that the cost efficiency of REDD+ may be much less than originally thought due to the need to factor in safeguard costs, transaction costs and monitoring costs. Nevertheless, REDD+ has raised global awareness of the world\xe2\x80\x99s forests and the factors affecting them, and future developments should contribute to the emergence of new landscape-based approaches to protecting a wider range of ecosystem services.'

Abstract: 'The nitrogen isotope of soil is of emerging significance as an indicator of climatic change and biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen in nature systems. In this paper, the nitrogen content and isotopic composition of modern ecosystems from arid and semiarid Loess Plateau in northwestern China, including plant roots and surface soil, were determined to investigate trends in \xce\xb415N variation of plant roots and soil along a precipitation and temperature gradient in northwestern China under the East Asian Monsoon climate condition. The \xce\xb415N values of surface soil from the study area vary from \xe2\x88\x921.2\xe2\x80\xb0 to 5.8\xe2\x80\xb0 but from \xe2\x88\x925.1\xe2\x80\xb0 to 1.9\xe2\x80\xb0 in the plant roots. Our results indicate that (1) although the isotopic compositions of both plant roots and surface soil change with a similar trend along the climate gradient, the apparent nitrogen difference between plant roots and soil existed, with \xce\x94\xce\xb415N values ranging from 0.3\xe2\x80\xb0 to 7.2\xe2\x80\xb0 with average of 4.1\xe2\x80\xb0 and (2) mean annual precipitation (MAP) is the dominant factor for isotopic composition of plant-soil nitrogen in the Loess Plateau, and the \xce\xb415N values are less correlated with MAT; we suggest that nitrogen isotopic composition of soil is a potential tracer for environmental changes.'

Abstract: 'The paleotropical tree genusMacaranga (Euphorbiaceae) comprises all stages of interaction with ants, from facultative associations to obligate myrmecophytes. In SE.-Asia food availability does not seem to be the limiting factor for the development of a close relationship since all species provide food for ants in form of extrafloral nectar and/or food bodies. Only myrmecophyticMacaranga species offer nesting space for ants (domatia) inside internodes which become hollow due to degeneration of the pith. Non-myrmecophytic species have a solid stem with a compact and wet pith and many resin ducts. The stem interior of some transitional species remains solid, but the soft pith can be excavated. The role of different ant-attracting attributes for the development of obligate ant-plant interactions is discussed. In the genusMacaranga, the provision of nesting space seems to be the most important factor for the evolution of obligate myrmecophytism.'

Abstract: 'High-throughput sequencing using targeted enrichment and transcriptomic methods enables rapid construction of phylogenomic data sets incorporating hundreds to thousands of loci. These advances have enabled access to an unprecedented amount of nucleotide sequence data, but they also pose new questions. Given that the loci targeted for enrichment are often highly conserved, how informative are they at different taxonomic scales, especially at the intraspecific/phylogeographic scale? We investigate this question using Australian scincid lizards in the Eugongylus group (Squamata: Scincidae). We sequenced 415 anchored hybrid enriched (AHE) loci for 43 individuals and mined 1650 exons (1648 loci) from transcriptomes (transcriptome mining) from 11 individuals, including multiple phylogeographic lineages within several species of Carlia, Lampropholis, and Saproscincus skinks. We assessed the phylogenetic information content of these loci at the intergeneric, interspecific, and phylogeographic scales. As a further test of the utility at the phylogeographic scale, we used the anchor hybrid enriched loci to infer lineage divergence parameters using coalescent models of isolation with migration.'

Abstract: 'It is known that the tribological behaviors of snake skins are contributed by the synergistic action of multiple factors, such as surface morphology and mechanical properties, which has inspired fabrication of scale-like surface textures in recent years. However, the coupling effect and mechanism remain to be elucidated. In this work, the morphology and mechanical properties of the scales from different body sections (leading body half, middle trunk and tailing body half) and positions (dorsal, lateral and ventral) of Boa constrictor and Eryx tataricus were characterized and compared to investigate the corresponding effects on the tribological behaviors and to probe the possible coupling mechanism. The morphological characterizations of scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed significant differences between the two species that the scales from Boa constrictor are rougher in general. The mechanical properties measured by nanoindentation corroboratively demonstrated substantial differences in elastic modulus and hardness. Interestingly, the ventral scales with lower surface roughness, together with relatively larger elastic modulus and hardness, manifest higher friction coefficients. A \xe2\x80\x9cdouble-crossed\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis was proposed to explain the observed coupling effect of morphology and mechanical properties on friction, which may afford valuable insights for the design of bionic surface with desirable tribological performance.'

Abstract: 'Education is broadly defined as the set of processes by which each generation of human beings acquires the culture in which they grow up. By this definition, education is part and parcel of our biological makeup. An analysis of education in hunter-gatherer bands indicates that young humans are designed, by natural selection, to acquire the culture through their self-directed play and exploration. Research at a modern-day democratic school designed to facilitate self-education demonstrates that our hunter-gatherer educative instincts are quite adequate for education today, given an appropriate educational environment. The ideal environment for such education\xe2\x80\x94found both in hunter-gatherer bands and at the school studied\xe2\x80\x94is one in which young people (a) have unlimited free time and much space in which to play and explore; (b) can mix freely with other children of all ages; (c) have access to a variety of knowledgeable and caring adults; (d) have access to culturally relevant tools and equipment and are free to play and explore with those items; (e) are free to express and debate any ideas that they wish to express and debate; (f) are free from bullying (which includes freedom from being ordered around arbitrarily by adults); and (g) have a true voice in the group\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making process. The per-student cost required to create such settings is less than half that of the average for our current public schools.'

The fruits and seeds are over-exploited due to their wide range of uses, and questions have been raised about whether the intensive exploitation poses any threat to the conservation of the species.'

Abstract: 'Excrement scarcity is one of the main historical factors leading dung beetles to adapt to other food resources. In the Caatinga, a seasonally tropical dry forest, harsh environmental conditions seem to restrict the availability of food resources. In this scenario, the aim of our study was to experimentally investigate the attractiveness of different potential food resources to these insects in the Caatinga. Field samplings were performed, and we tested five resources in pitfall baited traps: excrement, carrion, fruits of two species of columnar cacti, and seeds of one species of Euphorbiaceae (Jatropha mollissima (Pohl)). In a controlled setting, we tested dietary preferences of Deltochilum verruciferum Felsche by offering one or two resources simultaneously. In the field experiments, 297 dung beetles (9 species) were recovered from the traps, and D. verruciferum was the most abundant species. Carrion and excrement were the most attractive resources. Controlled dietary preference tests with D. verruciferum evidenced that these beetles used all tested food resources, excrement and carrion most pronouncedly. Our findings support copro-necrophagy as the main feeding habit of D. verruciferum, but also suggest that alternative resources might be utilized if preferred resources are scarce.'

Abstract: 'This study assesses the potential impacts of future global warming on the carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems across monsoon Asia using the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) dataset. We used simulation results of two emission pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), climate projections of five climate models, and seven terrestrial biome models to analyze the changes in net primary production and carbon stocks in the South, Southeast, and East Asian subregions during the period 1981\xe2\x80\x932099. The simulations indicated that by the end of the 21st century, net primary production would increase by 9\xe2\x80\x9345\xc2\xa0% and ecosystem carbon storage would increase by 42\xe2\x80\x9386 Pg C. The clearest climatic impacts were found when using the adaptation-oriented emission scenario (RCP8.5), which assumes a greater CO2 increase and a larger change in climatic conditions. Substantial disparities in temporal trajectories and spatial patterns were found in the estimated changes, owing to the uncertainties in the emission scenarios, climate projections, and ecosystem models. We attempted to derive consistent patterns throughout the simulations to specify potential hotspots of climatic impacts (e.g., soil carbon change in the southern Tibetan Plateau). Finally, we discuss changes to the climatic characteristics in the study region (e.g., a change in the rainy season), the implications for ecosystem services, and the need for collaborative field monitoring studies.'

Abstract: 'All matters related to ethnography flow from a decision that originates at the very beginning of the research process\xe2\x80\x94the selection of the basic object of analysis\xe2\x80\x94and yet fieldworkers pay scant attention to this crucial task. As a result, most take as their starting point bounded entities delimited by location or social classification and in so doing restrict the kinds of arguments available to them. This article presents the alternative\xc2\xa0of relational ethnography. Relational ethnography involves studying fields rather than places, boundaries rather than bounded groups, processes rather than processed people, and cultural conflict rather than group culture. While this approach comes with its own set of challenges, it offers an ethnographic method that works with the relational and processual nature of social reality.'

Abstract: 'Surface temperatures are projected to increase 3\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xb0C over much of Africa by the end of the 21st century. Precipitation projections are less certain, but the most plausible scenario given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that the Sahel and East Africa will experience modest increases (~5%) in precipitation by the end of the 21st century. Evapotranspiration (Ea) is an important component of the water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles that impact several climate properties, processes, and feedbacks. The interaction of Ea with climate change drivers remains relatively unexplored in Africa. In this paper, we examine the trends in Ea, precipitation (P), daily maximum temperature (Tmax), and daily minimum temperature (Tmin) on a seasonal basis using a 31\xc2\xa0year time series of variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface model (LSM) Ea. The VIC model captured the magnitude, variability, and structure of observed runoff better than other LSMs and a hybrid model included in the analysis. In addition, we examine the inter-correlations of Ea, P, Tmax, and Tmin to determine relationships and potential feedbacks. Unlike many IPCC climate change simulations, the historical analysis reveals substantial drying over much of the Sahel and East Africa during the primary growing season. In the western Sahel, large increases in daily maximum temperature appear linked to Ea declines, despite modest rainfall recovery. The decline in Ea and latent heating in this region could lead to increased sensible heating and surface temperature, thus establishing a possible positive feedback between Ea and surface temperature.'

Abstract: 'When Solondz showed up, she walked over to Eldredge and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI recognize you from your picture!\xe2\x80\x9d For a while, they just wandered around looking at the faces, trying to figure out who was who. The artist has moved on to new projects and said now she could not remember everyone she researched for the show last year. Besides, \xe2\x80\x9cweird things have happened to some of them.\xe2\x80\x9d Many images came out strangely bloated or distorted, others have diffused into virtual anonymity, and a few are defaced with cartoon balloon captions. At first, Eldredge was batting about 100 on the recognition scale and he could not identify Darwin or his own portrait, but\xe2\x80\x94as is often the case with both art and science\xe2\x80\x94patient observation led to clearer vision. There was Stephen Jay Gould, uncharacteristically wearing a tie, and one of the surviving Dawkins heads. Solondz said she mostly tried to stick to one image per scientist.

Abstract: 'Some moths species are considered good indicators of habitat quality because they are very responsive to human disturbance, vegetation type, and successional processes. However, Saturniidae moths have not yet been considered as indicators of environmental quality. Little is known on the distribution of moth species in different vegetation types and the moths\xe2\x80\x99 seasonal variations in the Brazilian savannah. Therefore, this study aims to describe the spatial distribution and temporal patterns of moths belonging to the Saturniidae family in two vegetation types\xe2\x80\x94Cerrado sensu stricto on rocky outcrops and semi-deciduous forest\xe2\x80\x94in both the rainy and dry seasons. It addresses the influence of the climatic seasons and vegetation types on abundance, richness, and species composition to describe the temporal and spatial distribution patterns and the relationship between the ecological aspects and the life history of these moths. This study was conducted in the Cerrado phytogeographical domain, in Pireneus State Park, Goi\xc3\xa1s, Brazil. The results revealed that most Saturniidae species sampled are present during the rainy season and typically found in forest habitats. Furthermore, a clear positive connection was found between the abundance pattern and rainfall seasonality and humid habitats; this is apparently related to the physiological tolerance of these moths, due to rudimentary mouthparts during their adulthood. Thus, rainfall and a forest habitat are important to and fundamental requirements for the persistence of the Saturniidae species in the Cerrado domain. Based on the results of this study, we suggest the use of saturniid species as indicators of changes in vegetation and climatic conditions.'

Abstract: 'The present study examined whether or not coexisting congeneric plant species have different defense strategies against herbivores, and the intensity of defense changes ontogenetically. We focused on nine myrmecophytic Macaranga species and estimated the intensity of non-biotic and biotic defense by the degree of leaf damage in ant-free and ant-occupied plants, respectively. Ant colonization of myrmecophytic Macaranga species occurred in the early stage of plant development (5\xe2\x80\x9350 cm-tall seedlings). Following the colonization, damage by leaf eaters was minimized and stable during the ontogenetic development of the host plants due to protection by ants. In ant-free trees, however, herbivore damage was immense in seedlings and decreased as trees grew. Interspecific comparison of leaf damage and herbivore fauna supported that coexisting congeneric plants differ in their types of non-biotic (chemical/structural) defense: without ant protection, Macaranga beccariana, for example, was somewhat resistant to leaf eaters but susceptible to gall-makers, Macaranga trachyphylla was heavily infested by generalist leaf eaters, and Macaranga winkleri was exploited by ant-predatory birds. Despite these variations in chemical/structural defense, ant-colonized plants were generally well defended by ants against all kinds of herbivores. This suggests that the individual host-specific ant mutualists are well adapted to deter the chemically or structurally adapted herbivores. These results imply that in the history of diversification in the Macaranga\xe2\x80\x93ant\xe2\x80\x93herbivore system, a sequence of mutual counter adaptation took place not only between plants and herbivores but also between ants and herbivores.'

Abstract: 'The nodulation of provenances of Acacia seyal, Acacia tortilis and Faidherbia albida, and other indigenous multipurpose tree species were tested in 14 different soil samples collected from diverse agro-ecological zones in southern Ethiopia. Associated rhizobia were isolated from these and from excavated nodules of field standing mature trees, and phenotypically characterized. Indigenous rhizobia capable of eliciting nodules on at least one or more of the woody legume species tested were present in most of the soils. Tree species were markedly different in nodulation in the different site soils. Sesbania sesban and Acacia abyssinica showed higher nodulation ability across the different sites indicating widespread occurrence of compatible rhizobia in the soils. The nodulation patterns of the different provenances of Acacia spp. suggested the existence of intraspecific provenance variations in rhizobial affinity which can be exploited to improve N fixation through tree selection. Altogether, 241 isolates were recovered from the root nodules of trap host species and from excavated nodules. Isolates were differentiated by growth rate and colony morphology and there were very fast-, fast-, slow-, and very slow-growing rhizobia. The bulk of them (68.5%) were fast-growing acid-producing rhizobia while 25.3% were slow-growing alkali-producing types. Fast-growing alkali-producing (2.9%) and slow-growing acid-producing strains (3.3%) were isolated from trap host species and excavated nodules, respectively. All isolates fell into four colony types: watery translucent, white translucent, dull glistering and milky (curdled) type. The diversity of indigenous rhizobia in growth rate and colony morphology suggested that the collection probably includes several rhizobial genera.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation and degradation are important aspects of landscape dynamics and have global significance. Quantification of landscape pattern using landscape metrics help in characterisation of landscapes and thus overall health of the forest cover. Himalayan foothills are one of the most important and fragile landscapes. Developmental activities and depdendence on the forest resources have altered the spatial pattern of these natural landscapes to a great extent. These changes in the landscape were analysed using satellite data from 1990, 2001 and 2006. The vegetation type maps of Dehradun forest division were prepared by supervised classification technique in order to study the landscape dynamics. Patch density, edge density, shape index, cohesion index, interspersion and juxtaposition index, normalised entropy, and relative richness are some important landscape metrics used in the study for quantifying the characteristics of landscape. The landscape metrics analysis and transformation analysis show that the forested areas are getting degraded and physical connectedness between the patches have also decreased making them isolated. The study demonstrates the importance of geospatial tools for monitoring the impact of disturbances on the forest ecosystem health, which can further help in landscape management.'

Abstract: 'A new lung-dwelling nematode species is described from the common lancehead Bothrops atrox (Linnaeus) in the Brazilian Amazon Region. The species is assigned to the genus Serpentirhabdias Tkach, Kuzmin & Snyder, 2014 based on the presence of six lips arranged in two lateral groups, the absence of prominent cuticular inflations, and lung parasitism in snakes. Serpentirhabdias atroxi n. sp. differs from other species of the genus mainly by details of the morphology of the anterior end: cuticularised ring surrounding the anterior part of the buccal cavity and six minute onchia present in the oesophastome. Serpentirhabdias atroxi n. sp. is the seventh species of the genus known from the Neotropical Realm and the second species described from viperid snakes.\n'

Abstract: 'Exposure to ecotourists often disrupts animal behavior, which is known to contribute to heightened mortality rates. In the Amazon, the emblematic, communal nesting Hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) is frequently pursued by tourists eager for close views. Such encounters may cause heightened stress levels, and egg or nestling predation due to decreased parental attendance to nests and nestlings. The effect of reducing conversational tourist noise near wildlife is poorly understood, but represents one potential mechanism of mitigating the impacts of ecotourists on wildlife. In this study, we approached Hoatzins by canoe, playing recorded tourist conversations at different volumes. Both the distances from which we observed Hoatzins becoming agitated (e.g., clucking, defecation, etc.) and flush (e.g., flight or climbing away) were positively correlated with volume. Within 10\xc2\xa0weeks Hoatzins began to habituate to silent approaches. Tourist conversations, however, continued to elicit the same heightened disturbance responses throughout data collection. Therefore, to have the best chance of seeing Hoatzins at a short distance and minimizing potentially negative disturbances, ecotourists should cease all conversation. Although not tested, silence is probably the best strategy when looking for many wildlife species.'

Abstract: 'This paper addresses a central debate in research and policy on population and environment, namely the extent to which rapid population growth is associated with the massive deforestation currently underway in the tropics. We utilize the experience of Costa Rica during the last forty years to illustrate what the main issues are, discuss the history of deforestation in that country, and present results from conventional regression methods and from the application of spatial analyses. These analyses enable us to estimate the magnitude of the relation between population and deforestation and to identify the factors that are responsible for the linkage between them.'

Abstract: 'Global forest ecosystems are under the threat of illegal logging. In this article, illegal logging activities and the principal causes of such violations are discussed in view of the available data and case studies from the Turkish forestry sector. A brief discussion of the importance of illegal logging within a global context, along with a description of Turkish forestry and deforestation activities, is provided. Underlying causes of illegal logging are discussed, and some solutions are recommended. It is concluded that illegal logging is a serious worldwide problem that exploits all forests. Turkish forests have suffered their share of such destructive illegal practices, although the range of impact varies from one period to another, depending upon the circumstances. The underlying causes of illegal logging activities derive from the economic, political, and cultural structures of Turkish society.'

Abstract: 'A number of systemic theories appear to be converging in conclusion. The conclusion is that things are inherently unknowable to the human mind. People are coming to know of the unknowable. This paper introduces such ideas in the context of systemic practice. Implications for efficiency, effectiveness, and ethical matters are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Common property regimes may contribute to environmental conservationand offer a complementary institutional model to state-run protected areas. The potential conservation value of common property management is of particular significance in Mexico, where a large majority of forests are held communally. Systems of common property management often exist in a context of close institutional overlap with state institutions. This project assessed the function of a common property regime nested within Lagunas de Montebello National Park (PNLM) in Chiapas, Mexico. We documented forest status and analyzed common property forest management institutions following severe fires that threatened forest conservation. Forests managed by the common property regime are less intact than federal forests, yet still moderately conserved, and many attributes necessary for common property management are functional, despite the recent fire crisis. Yet external authorities contest common property management by local institutions, resulting in limited joint management by the national park and the community. Formalization and expansion of de facto cooperation between the federal and community institutions may enhance forest conservation within PNLM.'

Abstract: 'The global area of planted biofuel crops has been increasing rapidly, but the environmental and social consequences of widespread adoption of biofuel production remain largely unexplored. How do we measure efficiency and net energy of a complex system, such as the interaction between agriculture, human society and technology? This paper provides background and identifies assumptions in its overview of competing and overlapping methods. We emphasize that biofuels, as well as all other resources with their associated processes, should be analyzed as embedded in complex systems. The reason why society looks at biofuels favorably is because the methodological approaches used in the present scientific literature are narrow and far from holistic. What is excluded from the analysis has crucial implications on what is regarded as sustainable.'

Abstract: 'This essay explores the role of the coca economy in the politics of basic foodstuff production in the lowlands department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Efforts throughout the 1980s and 1990s to diminish the coca economy in Santa Cruz have led to a significant decrease in the physical presence of coca in the region. This paper argues that while coca has been physically eradicated, the relationships and inequalities that characterized the coca economy at its height in the 1980s and 1990s continue to haunt present-day agrarian relations and decisions in the region. Using the framework of haunting and drawing on stories narrating the intersections between the livelihood challenges of rice farmers in the province of Ichilo, Santa Cruz, regional agrarian politics, and regional-state governance conflicts, I explore how the coca economy matters to the dynamics of principal agrarian foodstuff production. While coca cultivation in Ichilo is expressly assigned to the past and modern agrarian politics are explicitly articulated as \xe2\x80\x9cpost-coca,\xe2\x80\x9d this paper offers a reminder about how the coca economy continues to shape present day agrarian politics, even as it is considered \xe2\x80\x9csuccessfully\xe2\x80\x9d eradicated.'

Abstract: 'We present an analysis of local species richness in neotropical forests, based on a number of 0.1 ha samples of woody plants collected by the late Alwyn Gentry. For each of 69 forests, soils were analysed and climatic data were collated. Using transformed independent variables and interaction terms, multiple regression equations were developed that explained the greatest possible amount of variation in species richness, and the best equations were selected on the basis of regression diagnostics. The best models are presented for (a) all neotropical forests, (b) forests west of the Andes (transandean) and (c) east of the Andes (cisandean), and for various subsets based on elevation and annual rainfall. For the whole dataset, and for most subsets, annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality were the most important variables for explaining species richness. Soil variables were correlated with precipitation \xe2\x80\x94 drier forests have more nutrient-rich soils. After the inclusion of rainfall variables, available soil nutrient concentrations contributed little to explaining or accounting for additional variation in species numbers, indicating that tropical forest species richness is surprisingly independent of soil quality. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that plants in mature tropical forests may obtain nutrients through the process of direct cycling, in which mineral nutrients are extracted from litterfall before they enter the soil. The strong relationship between community species richness and rainfall patterns has implications for biodiversity conservation. Wet forests with an ample year-round moisture supply harbour the greatest number of woody plant species and should be a focus of conservation efforts.'

Abstract: "This paper addresses the compatibility of World Bank policies towards population growth, development and biodiversity in the Third World. The World Bank has been central to the design and implementation of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the remit of which includes the conservation of global biodiversity. However, the Bank's influence over the facility has in itself created controversy which may undermine its effectiveness. More significantly, the Bank's commitment to the GEF is subverted by its policies in other social and economic sectors. The World Bank, together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), directs the structural adjustment of Third World economies through economic deregulation and privatization. This approach exacerbates inequalities and further empowers large landowners who may then displace tenant farmers and claim exclusive rights to former common land. Thus, biodiversity loss occurs as large landowners reorientate the land use towards the production of export goods and dispossessed farmers invade marginal land. Population growth influences biodiversity loss through its contribution to agricultural intensification and the settlement of marginal land. The World Bank encourages this trend through its non-committal approach to population control, but more especially through structural adjustment's positive effect on fertility."

Abstract: 'This paper explores issues that are central to ecological economics. In spite of a substantial body of research and other literature that has appeared in recent decades on transition, and countless other efforts, no progress has been made to halt the increase in global warming, global emissions, rampant population growth, or several hundred other critical planet sustainability indicators including global species extinction. The opposite is true. Consumption has escalated and it is poised to double and, with it, planetary decay has followed closely. The aim of this work is to introduce a pragmatic solution and the economics mechanisms solidly rooted in science, in the laws of conservation of mass and energy, and in environmental and ecological sustainability that are necessary to overcome the tremendous forces of social, political, and economic resistance to major change. To advance towards a sustainable civilization, adopting a holistic approach with those underlying principles in all aspects of human activity, among others economy, finance, industry, commerce, engineering, politics, architecture, and education, is both lacking and fundamentally required. A short review of the state-of-the-art of the science on the critical status of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s resources and its life-supporting systems is presented, as well as a brief catalog of the seminal works of the science that gave rise to its metrics and established early on the groundwork for the understanding of the degree of sustainability of the planet. We present the argument why past and current schemes of human economics, organization, culture, and politics cannot achieve anything else, but complete and utter failure under their own underlying precepts. A rigorous and disciplined process on how to overcome and avoid the precipitous decline and collapse of the environmental and planetary biosystems on which all life depends, including human life, and a new view towards the world and the universe we all have no choice but to live in, are also offered.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents a novel methodology in which an individual\xe2\x80\x99s optimization decisions are statistically decomposed into choices of systems, system-specific outcomes, and the overall outcome in an integrative framework. The methodology is applied to individuals\xe2\x80\x99 decisions on natural resource enterprises given climatic changes. This paper finds that when the Goddard Institute scenario comes to pass by the middle of this century, adoption of a crops-only enterprise will fall, so will adoption of a crops\xe2\x80\x93forests enterprise. Instead, people will increase adoption of a livestock-only as well as a crops\xe2\x80\x93livestock\xe2\x80\x93forests enterprise. The impacts of climate change on the six enterprises are varied, which are calculated from the estimated models by altering climate variables. The crops-only enterprise will lose the value of land by 8.3\xc2\xa0%. However, the livestock-only enterprise will gain by 8.9\xc2\xa0%. The crops\xe2\x80\x93livestock\xe2\x80\x93forests enterprise also will gain largely by 7.8\xc2\xa0%. The impacts on the other enterprises are muted, e.g., 1\xc2\xa0% gain for the crops\xe2\x80\x93livestock enterprise. The total damage under the scenario is expected to be a loss of 1.9\xc2\xa0% of land value. Under a severer UK Met Office scenario, the damage is predicted to increase to 6.2\xc2\xa0%.'

Abstract: 'In a meta-analysis we integrate peer-reviewed studies that provide quantified estimates of future projected ecosystem changes related to quantified projected local or global climate changes. In an advance on previous analyses, we reference all studies to a common pre-industrial base-line for temperature, employing up-scaling techniques where necessary, detailing how impacts have been projected on every continent, in the oceans, and for the globe, for a wide range of ecosystem types and taxa. Dramatic and substantive projected increases of climate change impacts upon ecosystems are revealed with increasing annual global mean temperature rise above the pre-industrial mean (\xce\x94Tg). Substantial negative impacts are commonly projected as \xce\x94Tg reaches and exceeds 2\xc2\xb0C, especially in biodiversity hotspots. Compliance with the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Article 2) requires that greenhouse gas concentrations be stabilized within a time frame \xe2\x80\x9csufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change\xe2\x80\x9d. Unless \xce\x94Tg is constrained to below 2\xc2\xb0C at most, results here imply that it will be difficult to achieve compliance. This underscores the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions by accelerating mitigation efforts and by protecting existing ecosystems from greenhouse-gas producing land use change processes such as deforestation.'

Abstract: 'Landscape structure is an important determinant of biological fluxes and species composition, but species do not respond equally to landscape features or spatial extents. Evaluating \xe2\x80\x9cmulti-scale\xe2\x80\x9d responses of species to landscape structure is an important framework to be considered, allowing insights about habitat requirements for different groups. We evaluated the response of Brazilian Cerrado\xe2\x80\x99s bees (eusocial vs. solitary ones) to both the amount and isolation of remnant vegetation in eight nested multiple-local scales. Response variables included abundance, observed, and estimated species richness, and beta diversity (split into nestedness and turnover resultant dissimilarities). Eusocial species\xe2\x80\x99 abundance responded to landscape structure at narrow scales of fragment isolation (250\xc2\xa0m of radius from sampling sites), while solitary species\xe2\x80\x99 abundance responded to broader scales to fragment area (2000\xc2\xa0m). Eusocial species nestedness also responded to landscape features in broader scales (1500\xc2\xa0m), especially to increasing fragment isolation. However, all the remaining response variables did not respond to any other landscape variables in any spatial scale considered. Such contrasting responses of the abundances of eusocial vs. solitary species are related to the inherent life-history traits of each group. Important attributes in this context are different requirements on food resources, population features, and flight abilities. Species-specific dispersal abilities may be the main determinants of the nested patterns found for eusocial species at 1500\xc2\xa0m. Considering these results, we suggest that different bee groups are considered separately in further landscape analyses, especially in other Brazilian biomes, for a better understanding of landscape effects on these organisms.'

Abstract: 'Transnational environmental crime is a global problem encompassing not only criminal violations of the law, but harms against the environment and the people reliant upon it as a natural resource. Grounded in the green criminological theory of eco-global criminology, this paper explores the transnational environmental crime of the illegal timber trade in the Russian Far East unpicking the threats to ecological well-being and the global nature and impacts of this crime. In researching transnational environmental crime, it is crucial to uncover the distinct local and regional variations of the forces at play; for this paper that means analyzing the role of organized crime and corruption in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s timber black market. This information was obtained by using the current literature and interviews with Russian and international experts in order to uncover the role of these actors in the harvesting, smuggling and selling of timber. From this exploration, a structure of the illegal timber trade in this region is proposed including at which points along the black market chain organized crime and/or corruption are involved. Additionally, from an eco-global criminological foundation this paper analyzes the consequences to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s people, its environment and the global community if the illegal timber trade is to continue in its current state.'

Abstract: 'The task of tracing the notion of expression in Merleau-Ponty extends into various domains such as aesthetics, philosophy of biology, and ontology. V\xc3\xa9ronique F\xc3\xb3ti has risen to this challenge and given us a book fully worthy of reading. What makes expression such a difficult subject to focus on is mostly the fact that, with all its ambiguities, it distils the plenitude of Merleau-Ponty\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy, although it is not constantly in the foreground. The topic of expression becomes the vehicle by means of which Merleau-Ponty questions philosophy itself, along with language, art, history, culture, life, perception, nature, and being as flesh; nevertheless, Merleau-Ponty does not always give the notion of expression its proper due. Hence, the most appropriate way of dealing with the topic of expression in Merleau-Ponty is to approach it in its unity and from as many different aspects as possible\xe2\x80\x94precisely what F\xc3\xb3ti does. Thus, in contrast to the common viewing of expression only in its connection to aesthetics or language, F\xc3\xb3ti\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the philosophy of biology and environmental ethics, as well as her deep knowledge of the rationalist tradition, has critically enriched her understanding of expression.'

Abstract: 'Between July 2000 and August 2001 forty-threeair samples were collected in the northernCaribbean: Twenty-six in the US VirginIslands, and 17 samples aboard ship during two1-week cruises. Samples were collected duringAfrican dust events and non-dust conditions andscreened for the presence of culturablebacteria and fungi. A total of 3,652 liters ofair were collected during non-dust conditions,with 19 bacteria and 28 fungi being recovered.During dust conditions a total of 2,369 litersof air were screened resulting in the recoveryof 171 bacteria and 76 fungi.

These results support previousAfrican dust research and further demonstratethat dust particles can serve as a vessel forthe global dispersion of bacteria and fungi.Dustborne microorganisms may play a significantrole in the ecology and health of downwindecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Leaf phenology describes the seasonal cycle of leaf functioning and is essential for understanding the interactions between the biosphere, the climate and the atmosphere. In this study, we characterized the spatial patterns in phenological variations in eight contrasting forest types in an Indian region using coarse resolution NOAA AVHRR satellite data. The onset, offset and growing season length for different forest types has been estimated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Further, the relationship between NDVI and climatic parameters has been assessed to determine which climatic variable (temperature or precipitation) best explain variation in NDVI. In addition, we also assessed how quickly and over what time periods does NDVI respond to different precipitation events. Our results suggested strong spatial variability in NDVI metrics for different forest types. Among the eight forest types, tropical dry deciduous forests showed lowest values for summed NDVI (SNDVI), averaged NDVI (ANDVI) and integrated NDVI (I-NDVI), while the tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh had highest values. Within the different evergreen forest types, SNDVI, ANDVI and INDVI were highest for tropical wet evergreen forests, followed by tropical evergreen forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests and were least for tropical dry evergreen forests. Differences in the amplitude of NDVI were quite distinct for evergreen forests compared to deciduous ones and mixed deciduous forests. Although, all the evergreen forests studied had a similar growing season length of 270 days, the onset and offset dates were quite different. Response of vegetative greenness to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and forest types. Linear correlations between mean monthly NDVI and temperature were found to yield negative relationships in contrast to precipitation, which showed a significant positive response to vegetation greenness. The correlations improved much for different forest types when the log of cumulative rainfall was correlated against mean monthly NDVI. Of the eight forest types, the NDVI for six forest types was positively correlated with the logarithm of cumulative rainfall that was summed for 3\xe2\x80\x934 months. Overall, this study identifies precipitation as a major control for vegetation greenness in tropical forests, more so than temperature.'

Abstract: 'Changes in nutrient and hydrological cycles caused by land disturbance typically lead to detrimental changes to ecosystems. This study utilized a paired, small-catchment approach to examine the effect of deforestation on soils and streams of the tropical Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. The first catchment had been cleared for pasture and the second consisted of undisturbed tropical wet forest. Soil concentrations of organic matter, total and soil-available phosphorus (P) were higher in the forested catchment with reductions of >33\xc2\xa0% of each in the deforested catchment. The effect of deforestation on stream discharge was a 59\xc2\xa0% increase in flow during the wet season and a higher Q5:Q95 (percentile flow) ratio showing that the deforested stream yielded shorter duration, higher magnitude flood peaks. The deforested catchment loss of dissolved inorganic nitrogen increased 95\xc2\xa0% over the forested catchment. Soluble reactive phosphorus showed a 43\xc2\xa0% higher load in the deforested catchment compared to the forested catchment. The molar N:P ratios were low and both streams were well below the level at which N limitation of lotic algal growth has been reported. It, therefore, appears that N is the limiting nutrient in streams in the study area. Soil nutrient depletion in the deforested catchment, accelerated by a changed hydrological regime, is the likely trajectory of soil\xe2\x80\x93water interactions in this tropical ecosystem. Loss of nutrients and organic matter from terrestrial ecosystems will likely lead to long-term impacts on lowland tropical communities. Should deforestation become widespread along this stretch of the Pacific coastline possible eutrophication of receiving transitional and coastal waters may occur.'

Abstract: 'Composition of cocoa beans depends on origin and cocoa processing such as fermentation, drying and roasting. However, less research has been conducted to analyse the composition of Peninsular Malaysia cocoa bean at different processing stages. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the proximate, phytosterol level, antioxidant content and activity of Peninsular Malaysia unfermented, unroasted, roasted cocoa beans and cocoa shells. Analysis involved was proximate analysis, total phenolic compound (Folin\xe2\x80\x93Ciocalteu reagent assay), antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay) and phytosterol composition. Results show that the crude fiber of unroasted cocoa beans and cocoa shells increased from 17.19 to 28.45% and 13.86 to 16.06% respectively after roasting process. The roasting process is suspected to increase the dietary fiber content of cocoa products due to the interaction between polysaccharides, protein, polyphenolic and Maillard products at high temperature. The total phenolic content in cocoa bean and cocoa shells ranged from 2.42 to 10.82\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g GAE/ml. The unfermented cocoa beans contain significantly (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) higher antioxidant activity (92.3%) compared to other samples. This study shows that cholesterol, stigmasterol and \xce\xb2-sitosterol were present in roasted cocoa beans and cocoa shells. Hence, the information on the composition of Malaysia unfermented, unroasted, roasted cocoa beans and cocoa shells are needed to enrich the databases composition as a reference for the cocoa industry.'

Abstract: 'Rapid expansion in biomass production for biofuels and bioenergy in the Americas is increasing demand on the ecosystem resources required to sustain soil and site productivity. We review the current state of knowledge and highlight gaps in research on biogeochemical processes and ecosystem sustainability related to biomass production. Biomass production systems incrementally remove greater quantities of organic matter, which in turn affects soil organic matter and associated carbon and nutrient storage (and hence long-term soil productivity) and off-site impacts. While these consequences have been extensively studied for some crops and sites, the ongoing and impending impacts of biomass removal require management strategies for ensuring that soil properties and functions are sustained for all combinations of crops, soils, sites, climates, and management systems, and that impacts of biomass management (including off-site impacts) are environmentally acceptable. In a changing global environment, knowledge of cumulative impacts will also become increasingly important. Long-term experiments are essential for key crops, soils, and management systems because short-term results do not necessarily reflect long-term impacts, although improved modeling capability may help to predict these impacts. Identification and validation of soil sustainability indicators for both site prescriptions and spatial applications would better inform commercial and policy decisions. In an increasingly inter-related but constrained global context, researchers should engage across inter-disciplinary, inter-agency, and international lines to better ensure the long-term soil productivity across a range of scales, from site to landscape.'

Abstract: 'Soil respiration (SR) is one of the largest contributors of terrestrial CO2 to the atmosphere. Environmental as well as physicochemical parameters influence SR and thus, different land use practices impact the emissions of soil CO2. In this study, we measured SR, bi-monthly, over a one-year period in a terrace tea plantation, a forest tea plantation and a secondary forest, in a subtropical mountain area in Xishuangbanna, China. Along with the measurement of SR rates, soil characteristics for each of the land use systems were investigated. Soil respiration rates in the different land use systems did not differ significantly during the dry season, ranging from 2.7\xc2\xb10.2 jumol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921 to 2.8\xc2\xb10.2 jumol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921. During the wet season, however, SR rates were significantly larger in the terrace tea plantation (5.4\xc2\xb10.5 umol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921) and secondary forest (4.9\xc2\xb10.4 umol m-2 s-1) than in the forest tea plantation (3.7\xc2\xb10.2 umol m\xe2\x88\x922 s\xe2\x88\x921). This resulted in significantly larger annual soil CO2 emissions from the terrace tea and secondary forest, than from the forest tea plantation. It is likely that these differences in the SR rates are due to the 0.5 times lower soil organic carbon concentrations in the top mineral soil in the forest tea plantation, compared to the terrace tea plantation and secondary forest. Furthermore, we suggest that the lower sensitivity to temperature variation in the forest tea soil is a result of the lower soil organic carbon concentrations. The higher SR rates in the terrace tea plantation were partly due to weeding events, which caused CO2 emission peaks that contributed almost 10% to the annual CO2 flux. Our findings suggest that moving away from heavily managed tea plantations towards low-input forest tea can reduce the soil CO2 emissions from these systems. However, our study is a case-study and further investigations and upscaling are necessary to show if these findings hold true at a landscape level.'

Abstract: 'Biochar is normally produced as a by-product of bioenergy. However, if biochar is produced as a co-product with bioenergy from sustainably managed forests and used for soil amendment, it could provide a carbon neutral or even carbon negative solution for current environmental degradation problems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of biochar production as a co-product of bioenergy and its implications. We focus on biochar production with reference to biomass availability and sustainability and on biochar utilization for its soil amendment and greenhouse gas emissions reduction properties. Past studies confirm that northwestern Ontario has a sustainable and sufficient supply of biomass feedstock that can be used to produce bioenergy, with biochar as a co-product that can replace fossil fuel consumption, increase soil productivity and sequester carbon in the long run. For the next step, we recommend that comprehensive life cycle assessment of biochar-based bioenergy production, from raw material collection to biochar application, with an extensive economic assessment is necessary for making this technology commercially viable in northwestern Ontario.'

Abstract: 'Enormous quantities of latex are found in over 40 plant families on a worldwide basis. Despite the proportions involved, the role of this substance within plants is still a matter of conjecture. Latex is closely associated with isoprene which may be emitted as a gas from both plants (that may or may not contain latex) and animals. The volume of isoprene expelled into the atmosphere each year is approximately equal to that of total methane emissions. The latter (but not the former), a known \xe2\x80\x9cgreenhouse gas\xe2\x80\x9d, is the subject of considerable concern. It appears reasonable, therefore, that efforts be made to examine more thoroughly the formation and function of latex and associated compounds in order to obtain a better understanding of a number of critical biological and environmental phenomena known to be associated with these phytochemicals. Possible roles played by these substances in both plants and their surrounding environment are described.'

Abstract: 'Australian aboriginal people who are living in traditional groups often have a variety of characteristic acquired features that distinguish them from those who have been resident in less traditional communities. These features include particular forms of scarification, tooth avulsion, and subincision of the penis. Skeletonized remains may also show acquired features such as marked dental attrition, parry fractures, and squatting notches of the long bones. Once features have been found at autopsy to indicate that the deceased may have come from a traditional aboriginal background, one can check for particular conditions with a high prevalence in tribal communities. Additionally, standard reporting practices may be modified to assist in traditional practices and rituals. The identification of a skeleton as aboriginal often means that the burial was historical and that a concealed homicide with body disposal is unlikely. Steps can then be taken to ensure that the remains are returned to aboriginal people/traditional landowners who will be able to re-inter the bones in a manner that is culturally sensitive and appropriate to their needs and belief systems.'

Abstract: 'The diversity, vegetative and reproductive characteristics, and phenology of litter decomposing macrofungi (LDM) were compared between humus forms and climatic regions. Fruiting bodies of LDM were examined for the forest floor of subtropical (ST), cool temperate (CT), and subalpine (SA) forests in Japan. Field surveys during one growing season yielded 35, 32, and 18 species in ST, CT, and SA, respectively. Species richness was generally higher in mull than in moder humus and in a warmer than in a cooler climate. A total of ten fungal families were observed, and species in the Mycenaceae dominated in the LDM assemblages at all study sites. A larger number of species fruited on deeper F layers of the forest floor in SA than in ST, where 74\xc2\xa0% of species fruited directly on leaf litter. This observation was consistent with the analysis of radiocarbon content in fruiting bodies, implying that LDM tended to utilize older carbon accumulated at deeper layers of the forest floor in cooler climates. Seasonal changes in the fruiting frequency over a growing season exhibited similar two-peak patterns for all the study sites, coinciding with the periods of rainfall and increasing and decreasing air temperatures in early summer and autumn, respectively, but the fruiting period extended longer in a warmer than in a cooler climate.'

Abstract: 'Food system sustainability depends, among other aspects, on the resilience of different components of food systems. By resilience, we mean the ability of a food system to withstand stress and shocks, recover, and adapt to change. In this study, we examined the resilience of food systems, firstly, by compiling the risks perceived by different food system actors in the Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia, and the northwestern Mount Kenya Region, Kenya\xe2\x80\x94two regions that are important to their respective national food supply. Secondly, we evaluated whether and under what circumstances these perceptions translate into adaptive or preventive strategies that benefit food system resilience. Among all actors, the most frequently perceived risks relate to production levels. Further, the many (sometimes contradictory) perceptions of risk and uncertainty among different actor groups do not necessarily translate into adaptation strategies. Reasons for this include structural factors as well as the \xe2\x80\x9crisk perception paradox\xe2\x80\x9d, particularly regarding preventive strategies. However, we also observed many implicit strategies illustrating how different actors develop responses within their possibilities. However, most such strategies were insufficient to mitigate, much less to adapt to, the perceived risks. To build resilience, existing innovative policies need to be enforced in both countries. These include disaster risk reduction programs and programs to reduce the vulnerability of marginalized groups who are crucial to food systems, such as smallholder farmers, pastoralists, and food workers.'

Abstract: 'Parrots are the most threatened group of birds in the world, mainly because of the reduction and fragmentation of their natural habitats. However, few studies have investigated the dynamics of parrot populations in disturbed landscapes on a broad scale. In this paper, we studied the ecological interactions of the vulnerable blue-winged macaw (Primolius maracana) in a fragmented landscape surrounding a large protected park in southeastern Brazil. We sampled 36 forest fragments that varied in size, characteristics, degree of isolation and type of surrounding matrix in order to assess the importance of habitat features on the maintenance of these birds. Blue-winged macaws were recorded in 70% of the satellite remnants that were sampled, which included large and small blocks of forest. These areas were used as sites for feeding, nesting or overnight rests, and also provided connectivity for birds\xe2\x80\x99 displacements. However, the frequency of macaw visits varied among the remnants, and this was related to habitat features such as patch size, human use of surrounding land, and the proximity to the protected park, to urban areas and to the birds\xe2\x80\x99 roosting areas. In general, landscape-scale parameters explained more of the variation in the frequency of visits by macaws than did patch-scale parameters. These results demonstrate the importance of landscape mosaics for the survival of blue-winged macaws.'

Abstract: 'The Ronnbergia Alliance is a recently described lineage composed of two highly supported and identifiable clades with strong geographic correlation: the Pacific and the Atlantic clades. These clades, however, are composed by species currently placed in the polyphyletic genera Aechmea, Hohenbergia, and Ronnbergia. This study aims to reorganize the species that comprise both the Pacific and Atlantic clades into stable and predictable taxonomic categories. In this context, the 26 species that compose the Pacific clade are here circumscribed in the genus Ronnbergia, whereas the 44 species grouped in the Atlantic clade are assigned to the resurrected genus Wittmackia. An updated circumscription of these two genera is presented, including a taxonomic key to recognize the species. Additionally, the respective taxonomic transferences and general information to the species are presented in the form of a synopsis. This taxonomic treatment will facilitate future approaches on the study of the systematics, conservation, and evolution of the Ronnbergia Alliance.'

Abstract: 'In Ghana, forests provide many products on which the local population subsists. However, these resources are depleting due to a variety of factors including agricultural expansion and over-exploitation of forest resources. This paper presents an analysis of the level of local dependence on forest resources and its implications for forest management in Ghana. The paper also outlines the causes of continuing deforestation in the studied region from the perspective of the local residents and discusses what role they could play in addressing the problem. The aim is to share more light on the current causes of deforestation and make suggestions for improved community-based forest management practices that could help to reduce deforestation. Primary data was collected through personal interviews and focus group discussions with 431 household heads randomly selected from three Forest Districts in Ghana. The survey showed that income from agriculture constituted 60% of the average total rural household income. Forest income provided 38% of total household income, and off-farm income 2%. The four most highly ranked causes of deforestation are poverty-driven agriculture, lack of alternative rural wage employment other than farming, household population levels, and conflict in traditional land practices. This shows a shift in the view of local people who in the past were quick to blame logging companies and government policies for deforestation. The majority of the respondents depended on wild animals like snail, bush meat, wild honey and wild and cultivated vegetables. Given the reasons for deforestation, much thought needs to go into agroforestry practices (e.g. snail farming, bee keeping, fish farming, and vegetable production) in efforts to reduce deforestation, which are currently less promoted.'

Abstract: 'To understand the importance of plants in structuring the vertical distributions of soil nutrients, we explored nutrient distributions in the top meter of soil for more than 10,000 profiles across a range of ecological conditions. Hypothesizing that vertical nutrient distributions are dominated by plant cycling relative to leaching, weathering dissolution, and atmospheric deposition, we examined three predictions: (1) that the nutrients that are most limiting for plants would have the shallowest average distributions across ecosystems, (2) that the vertical distribution of a limiting nutrient would be shallower as the nutrient became more scarce, and (3) that along a gradient of soil types with increasing weathering-leaching intensity, limiting nutrients would be relatively more abundant due to preferential cycling by plants. Globally, the ranking of vertical distributions among nutrients was shallowest to deepest in the following order: P > K > Ca > Mg > Na = Cl = SO4. Nutrients strongly cycled by plants, such as P and K, were more concentrated in the topsoil (upper 20 cm) than were nutrients usually less limiting for plants such as Na and Cl. The topsoil concentrations of all nutrients except Na were higher in the soil profiles where the elements were more scarce. Along a gradient of weathering-leaching intensity (Aridisols to Mollisols to Ultisols), total base saturation decreased but the relative contribution of exchangeable K+ to base saturation increased. These patterns are difficult to explain without considering the upward transport of nutrients by plant uptake and cycling. Shallower distributions for P and K, together with negative associations between abundance and topsoil accumulation, support the idea that plant cycling exerts a dominant control on the vertical distribution of the most limiting elements for plants (those required in high amounts in relation to soil supply). Plant characteristics like tissue stoichiometry, biomass cycling rates, above- and belowground allocation, root distributions, and maximum rooting depth may all play an important role in shaping nutrient profiles. Such vertical patterns yield insight into the patterns and processes of nutrient cycling through time.'

Abstract: 'Community-based Forest Operations (CFOs) have played a notable role in promoting sustainability within Cameroon\xe2\x80\x99s indigenous forest-dependent communities, but they are fraught with a range of socio-economic and ecological hurdles. As a means of achieving more sustainable forest practices, one possible solution would be for CFOs to adopt forest certification, though various barriers would have to be overcome. Using a number of examples at the regional level, this paper examines the potential benefits and barriers to community forest certification in Cameroon. Specifically, the paper identifies these barriers as legislative and political, economic, and informational in nature. While adoption of forest certification hinges upon what initiatives are employed by CFOs, it is argued that there is also a need for the government of Cameroon to play a leadership role in removing hurdles and promoting the uptake of certification.'

Abstract: 'There is increasing pressure from communities neighbouring protected areas in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to harvest resources from these areas. For example,Hyphaene coriacea Geartn. (vegetable ivory palm) leaves are extensively used by Zulu people for commercial and subsistence craftwork. This study investigates the effect of varying leaf harvest intensities on leaf production ofHyphaene coriacea in the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and aims to provide some management guidelines for sustainable use. Replicate plots subjected to three different harvest intensities were established and numbers and lengths of unopened leaves were monitored over four years. Results suggest that a harvest intensity of one leaf stem-1 year-1 would be sustainable. This is equivalent to 34% of calculated annual production. The 650 ha harvest area is estimated to produce 191 750 leaves year-1 (4793 bundles) which could be harvested sustainably.'

Abstract: 'Theobroma cacao L. plants over-expressing a cacao class I chitinase gene (TcChi1) under the control of a modified CaMV-35S promoter were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of somatic embryo cotyledons. Southern blot analysis confirmed insertion of the transgene in eight independent lines. High levels of TcChi1 transgene expression in the transgenic lines were confirmed by northern blot analysis. Chitinase activity levels were measured using an in vitro fluorometric assay. The transgene was expressed at varying levels in the different transgenic lines with up to a sixfold increase of endochitinase activity compared to non-transgenic and transgenic control plants. The in vivo antifungal activity of the transgene against the foliar pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was evaluated using a cacao leaf disk bioassay. The assay demonstrated that the TcChi1 transgenic cacao leaves significantly inhibited the growth of the fungus and the development of leaf necrosis compared to controls when leaves were wound inoculated with 5,000 spores. These results demonstrate for the first time the utility of the cacao transformation system as a tool for gene functional analysis and the potential utility of the cacao chitinase gene for increasing fungal pathogen resistance in cacao.'

Abstract: 'Oil exploration and production (E&P) activities in remote regions are often considered a catalyst for landscape change through the direct alterations created by infrastructure features, as well as through the accessibility provided by roads. The construction, expansion and improvement of transportation routes in isolated areas can attract newcomers and resource users who engage in illegal logging, poaching, commercial agriculture, as well as planned and spontaneous colonization. These actions can lead to larger-scale surface disturbances that may also affect indigenous territories and natural preserves. However, do these parallel activities and outcomes always accompany E&P development, or can controlled access minimize changes? To answer this question we utilized an \xe2\x80\x9caccounting from above\xe2\x80\x9d approach that uses remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze surface disturbance patterns linked to infrastructure features for both E&P and parallel activities. Our study area included four neighboring oil blocks in eastern Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s tropical forest, displaying three types of E&P development: public-access, controlled-access and roadless. The first objective was to determine the spatial relationship between infrastructure pattern, disturbance regimes and the type of road access for the year 2000 using land-use land-cover maps, soils data, protected areas and colonization zones. The second objective was to examine the statistical relationships between agricultural conversion and the above factors. Spatial analysis findings suggest that areas of overlap where colonization zones, public-access roads and fertile soils meet are most prone to deforestation. Statistical findings from a linear regression model suggest that the presence of public-access non-oil roads are significant at explaining the conversion of natural vegetation (forest) to agriculture, while the presence of protected areas helps explain the conservation of forested land.'

Abstract: 'Mangroves provide several ecosystem goods and services to society. However, mangroves are frequently subjected to land conversion, overharvesting, and pollution including increased nitrogen (N) availability. Aiming to provide useful information to predict effects of N enrichment on mangroves, we evaluated literature data on N transformation rates in sediment, dissolved N (DN) fluxes across the sediment-water interface, and natural abundance of N stable isotopes (\xce\xb415N) in the sediment-plant system in conserved mangroves and those subjected to anthropogenic N enrichment.'

Abstract: 'A good indicator species should be easy to sample, identify and measure, and be informative about its ecological context. We analysed data from a nation-wide dung beetle survey in Venezuela in order to assess the indicative response of Oxysternon festivum (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) to vegetation and climatic condition in the Orinoco river basin. Our approach consisted of two steps: estimating habitat suitability (HS) from historical records and mean environmental conditions, and analysing four different properties measured during a nationwide survey (occurrence, total abundance, individual body size, and total biomass), in relationship with HS and current environmental covariates measured from remote sensors. O. festivum population status could not be completely explained by historical or current conditions alone, but rather by combinations of both. It was strongly associated with forest vegetation, but abundance, biomass and body size increased under harsher (hotter and drier) climatic conditions. Thus, O. festivum seems to be sensitive to changes in vegetation cover, but tolerant to certain levels of perturbance, where it probably replaces other, more sensitive species. Fully understanding the role of O. festivum requires the analysis of its relationships to other species. We strongly recommend the development of similar protocols for the analysis of other potential ecological indicator species, drawing information from historical and contemporary sources and exploiting the available statistical tools to reveal complex patterns. Given the high diversity of dung beetles, and the growing interest in this group, several candidates will probably be found in most tropical countries.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we evaluate the effects of spatial and environmental factors on the structure of tadpole assemblages in Central Amazonia testing the following hypotheses: (1) environmental factors are more important than spatial ones in tadpole richness distribution and (2) habitat structure variables are more important than biotic variables in tadpole richness distribution. Tadpoles were sampled at 20 riparian plots between February and June 2010. Spatial and environmental components explained the major part of the variation in observed and estimated tadpole richness, respectively. Among all fitted models, the best model that explains species richness distribution is the one that contains only the number of ponds. Our results showed that tadpole richness in streamside ponds is influenced by niche-based processes and can be explained by local factors related to habitat structure. Predator density was not an important biotic factor in our study, contradicting the results found by other studies conducted in tropical areas. However, neutral processes are also important because spatial variation can explain the spatial distribution of species richness, probably as a result of dispersal limitation. Therefore, our results contribute to understanding of the local and landscape features which influence the amphibian species diversity in a tropical forest.'

Abstract: 'Babassu is considered the largest native oil resource worldwide and occurs naturally in Brazil. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of babassu nut residues (epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp) for bioenergy use, especially for direct combustion and charcoal production. The material was collected in the rural area of the municipality of S\xc3\xadtio Novo do Tocantins, in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. Analyses were performed considering jointly the three layers that make up the babassu nut shell. The following chemical characterizations were performed: molecular (lignin, total extractives and holocellulose), elemental (C, H, N, S and O), immediate (fixed carbon, volatiles and ash), energy (higher heating value and lower heating value), physical (basic density and energy density) and thermal (thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis), besides the morphological characterization by scanning electron microscopy. Babassu nut residues showed a high bioenergy potential, mainly due to their high energy density. The use of this biomass as a bioenergy source can be highly feasible, given their chemical and thermal characteristics, combined with a low ash content. Babassu nut shell showed a high basic density and a suitable lignin content for the sustainable production of bioenergy and charcoal, capable of replacing coke in Brazilian steel plants.'

Abstract: 'The Framework Convention on Climate Change separately recognizes sources and sinks of greenhouse gases and provides incentives to establish C offset projects to help meet the goal of stabilizing emissions. Forest systems provide multiple opportunities to offset or stabilize greenhouse emissions through a reduction in deforestation (C sources), expansion of existing forests (CO2 sinks) or production of biofuels (offset fossil fuel combustion). Attributes and dimensions of eight forest-sector C offset projects, established over the past three years, were examined. The projects, mostly established or sponsored by US or European electric utilities, propose to conserve/sequester over 30 \xc3\x97 106 Mg C in forest systems at an initial cost of $1 to 30 Mg C. Given the relative novelty and complexity of forest sector C offset projects, a number of biogeochemical, institutional, socio-economic, monitoring, and regulatory issues merit analysis before the long-term potential and cost effectiveness of this greenhouse gas stabilization approach can be determined.'

Abstract: 'Human modification of the natural environment continues to create habitats in which mosquitoes, vectors of a wide variety of human and animal pathogens, thrive if unabated with an enormous potential to negatively affect public health. Historic examples of these modifications include of impoundments, dams, and irrigation systems that create havens for the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, dengue, and filariasis. Additionally, contemporary deforestation appears to be associated with the expansion of mosquito distributions and the increase in mosquito-borne disease transmission. These observations are not unique to the developing world, as urban sprawl also contributes significantly to mosquito habitats and offers a sanctuary to some vector populations. With foresight and planning, most of these systems can be appropriately managed to control vector populations and pathogen transmission. The key to disease control is developing an understanding of the contribution of human landscape modification to vector-borne pathogen transmission and how a balance may be achieved between human development, public health, and responsible land use.'

Abstract: 'A constant and controlled level of emission of carbon and other gases into the atmosphere is a pre-condition for preventing global warming and an essential issue for a sustainable world. Fires in the natural environment are phenomena that extensively increase the level of greenhouse emissions and disturb the normal functioning of natural ecosystems. Therefore, estimating the risk of fire outbreaks and fire prevention are the first steps in reducing the damage caused by fire. In this study, we build predictive models to estimate the risk of fire outbreaks in Slovenia, using data from a GIS, Remote Sensing imagery and the weather prediction model ALADIN. The study is carried out on three datasets, from three regions: one for the Kras region, one for the coastal region and one for continental Slovenia. On these datasets, we apply both classical statistical approaches and state-of-the-art data mining algorithms, such as ensembles of decision trees, in order to obtain predictive models of fire outbreaks. In addition, we explore the influence of fire fuel information on the performance of the models, measured in terms of accuracy, Kappa statistic, precision and recall. Best results in terms of predictive accuracy are obtained by ensembles of decision trees.'

Abstract: 'How, and under what conditions, can International Organizations (IOs) shape public opinion? The impact of IOs on public support for war has been studied closely by international relations scholars, yet their effects on environmental or human rights issues has not. This is surprising given the extent to which the success of these initiatives will depend upon cooperation through international institutions. This article examines how IOs can influence popular support for two policies aimed at solving global collective action problems: (1) the REDD+ deforestation initiative; and (2) efforts to resettle Syrian refugees. The results presented here use a pair of survey-based experiments to test whether public support for these policies can be affected by the recommendations made by various organizations and their member states. Somewhat surprisingly, the results suggest that endorsements by the United Nations have a greater effect on the US public than do endorsements by organizations known for their technical expertise, or by prominent international NGOs. These findings call into question some of the assumptions we commonly make about the perceived legitimacy of international organizations.'

Abstract: 'The scale at which seed dispersal operates has many implications for the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and diversity. We investigated the effect of short- (ants) and long-distance (birds) seed dispersal of the fleshy-fruited melastome, Miconia rubiginosa, in the Brazilian savanna. We estimated the contribution of dispersal vectors to the removal of the fruit crop from the canopy (birds), and once seeds have reached the cerrado floor (ants) over two fruiting seasons. Birds (13 species) removed up to 23.7% of the fruit crop from the crown, but dropped a substantial proportion of fruits beneath the parent plant. Birds removed a greater proportion of fruits from trees producing large fruit crops, as predicted by the fruit crop size hypothesis. However, up to 18.9% of the fruit crop fell beneath the parent plant as ripe fruit. Most fallen fruits were removed by ants (seven genera), which are likely to play a relatively important role in terms of the quantity of seeds dispersed, especially for plants producing small fruit crops (a conceptual model is presented). Birds and ants did not influence seed germination, but they differ in terms of the spatial scale of dispersal and deposition patterns. Ants probably play an important role in the local population dynamics of Miconia, whereas birds are responsible for long-distance dispersal associated with the colonization of new patches and metapopulation dynamics. By removing seeds from bird droppings, ants may also reshape at a finer scale the seed rain generated by primary dispersers. Indeed, seedlings and saplings of Miconia are more frequently found around leaf-cutter ant nests than in control areas away from ant nests or around large Miconia trees. The quantitative component of dispersal effectiveness by ants acting as \xe2\x80\x9crescuers\xe2\x80\x9d of seeds that fail to be dispersed, or fall under parent trees, is probably more important than currently recognized in other systems.'

Abstract: 'Despite a near universal consensus among scientists regarding the perils of climate change for human civilizations, climate change has not emerged as a key issue among science educators. This position paper advocates for the centrality of climate change in science education. Using Polanyi\xe2\x80\x99s critique of market in capitalist societies, it positions global climate change as an outcome of commodification of nature in market dominated societies. Thus, the paper argues that global climate change is primarily a societal issue that needs a societal response much more than a technological one. Further, it presents a case for considering science education as an important element of societal response to global climate change. In the end, the paper presents some ideas for re-imagining science education for the global climate change era.'

Abstract: 'The influence of prescribed changes in vegetation on the climate of the North American monsoon region is examined using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model Version 3.5 (NCAR CCSM3.5). Initial value ensemble experiments are performed in which the vegetation cover fraction over the North American monsoon region is reduced by 0.2 and the intra-annual climatic response is assessed probabilistically in each one-year ensemble experiment. Changes in the surface radiation budget include decreases in sensible and latent heat fluxes and increases in upward longwave and downward shortwave radiation fluxes, with small net changes in surface albedo. The climatic responses to reduced vegetation cover fraction include year-round increases in ground and surface air temperature, a dampened hydrologic cycle with decreased springtime evaporation, springtime and autumnal precipitation, and autumnal cloud cover, and enhanced atmospheric subsidence in late autumn. Decreased vegetation shifts the monsoon season over the Southwest United States earlier in the year. Within the North American monsoon region, the most robust vegetation feedbacks to climate are found over woody landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Primary productivity has played an important role in the global carbon cycle during the Quaternary. The average Corg/N ratio was 7.0 from the core MD97-2140 in the West Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) over the last 1 755 ka, which indicates a main contribution of marine organic carbon to the organic matter in the sediments. Large fluctuations in mass accumulation rates (MARs) of biogenics and lithogenics from this core since the marine isotope stage (MIS) 6 reflected the moderate variability in oceanographic condition, while little fluctuations in MAR-biogenics and -lithogenics from the MIS 59 to MIS 7 implied the relatively stable and uniform oceanographic condition, although the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) probably fluctuated by ca. 5 \xc2\xb0C. MAR-organic since the MIS 6 increased evidently during the glacial periods, which ascribed to terrestrial inputs, including lithogenic matter and dissolved nutrient, which also contribute to stimulating primary productivity. The results compared among the four cores in the WPWP since the MIS 9 indicate that in the western sector with the shallow thermocline, high primary productivity during the glacial periods was controlled by wind-induced surface water mixing, upwelling, and terrestrial inputs, while in the central and eastern sectors, the little different medium to low productivity might have been made by more intense upwelling driven by strong winds because the thicker warm surface water pool and the deeper thermocline prevented nutrient-bearing water from upwelling to upper water column even during the glacial times.'

Abstract: 'The organic matter in tropospheric aerosol plays animportant, yet undetermined role in atmosphericprocesses. The bulk of organic carbon representing asignificant part of the fine aerosol mass is bound toa polymeric matter whose structure and properties areto date largely unknown. Here we use thefingerprinting technique of derivatization pyrolysis-gas chromatography-massspectrometry tosubstantiate that in terms of chemical structure partof this polymer in rural aerosol in summer can beregarded as natural humic matter. We suggest thatthese compounds are likely to be directly emitted bybiogenic sources.'

Abstract: 'The use of cacao, in its familiar food and beverage form, dates back about 3,800\xc2\xa0years. By the time of the discovery of America by Europeans, the Aztecs and Mayans had developed methods for drying, roasting and grinding cacao beans for use in beverages and foods. Today, the same processes are used, but have been adapted to modern machinery. The current study was conducted to compare the traditional Mesoamerican processing and modern processing methods and their impact on the antioxidant activity and flavan-3-ol content of the resulting processed cocoa mass. Two cocoa bean types were used: unfermented cocoa beans commonly produced and consumed today by the native peoples of Mesoamerica, and fermented Ivory Coast cocoa beans representing the most common country of origin for cocoa in the world today. Both bean types were processed by roasting and grinding using traditional and modern processing methods. The traditional method consisted of roasting whole beans on an earthenware comal heated with wood charcoal, de-shelling the beans, then grinding the beans to a paste using a stone metate and mano. The modern method consisted of roasting cocoa beans with pilot-scale equipment that simulates large-scale chocolate manufacturing using whole bean drum roasters, deshelling the beans followed by mechanical grinding using a ball mill producing a chocolate paste. The antioxidant capacity and flavanol content of these chocolate pastes were then determined. The data show that the antioxidant capacity and flavanol content of unprocessed Mexican Lavado cocoa beans were significantly higher than that of the unprocessed, fermented Ivory Coast cocoa beans. In unfermented Mexican Lavado cocoa beans, the traditional and modern processing revealed no clear advantage with respect to the antioxidant and flavanol contents. However, for fermented Ivory Coast beans, there were some differences in the level of flavanols between traditionally processed and modern processed fermented beans. These differences, while significant for some, but not all of the flavanol measures, were attributed to final roast temperatures achieved and to the possible lack of uniformity of bean fermentation.'

Abstract: 'Habitat loss and fragmentation has long been considered the primary cause for biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation worldwide, and is a key research topic in landscape ecology (Wu 2013). Habitat fragmentation often refers to the reduction of continuous tracts of habitat to smaller, spatially distinct remnant patches, and habitat loss typically occurs concurrently\xc2\xa0with habitat fragmentation (Collinge 2009). Although some habitats are naturally patchy in terms of abiotic and biotic conditions (Wu and Loucks 1995), human actions have profoundly fragmented landscapes across the word (Haddad et al. 2015), altering the quality and connectivity of habitats. Therefore, understanding the causes and consequences of habitat fragmentation is critical to preserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.'

Abstract: 'With botanical collections of five key tree taxa an assessment is made of the usefulness of herbarium collections in a National Protected Areas Strategy in Guyana. Even though botanical collections are often concentrated in a few areas, causing a bias in diversity estimates, the data are useful for the estimation of species richness in large areas (1/10 of the country) and provide information on species distributions. Because of the taxonomic correctness of the names of the specimens, data on endemics is much more reliable than e.g. data in forest inventories. Based on the collections of Licania, Eschweilera, Lecythis, Swartzia, Lauraceae, and Sapotaceae a previous division in seven to eight forest regions is supported. There are significant differences in total species richness, or \xce\xb3-diversity, among the regions, with the Pakaraima Highlands having the highest \xce\xb3-diversity. Endemics are found in two concentrations, one in the Pakaraima Highlands and a very important one in the White Sands Formation in Central Guyana. These endemics are habitat specialists of the poor sandy soils of that area and are under serious threat due to forest exploitation and habitat degradation.'

Abstract: 'Cerrad\xc3\xa3o (Brazilian woodland savannas) and seasonally dry forests (SDF) from southeastern Brazil occur under the same climate but are remarkably distinct in species composition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of soil origin in the initial growth and distribution of SDF and Cerrad\xc3\xa3o species.'

Abstract: 'We review various aspects of the notion ofscale applied to natural systems, in particularcomplex adaptive systems. We argue that scalingissues are not only crucial from the standpointof basic science, but also in many appliedissues, and discuss tools for detecting anddealing with multiple scales, both spatial andtemporal. We also suggest that the techniquesof statistical mechanics, which have beensuccessful in describing many emergent patternsin physical systems, can also prove useful inthe study of complex adaptive systems.'

Abstract: 'Ten years of quantitative studies of forests on Krakatau demonstrate the vegetational difference resulting from multiple successional pathways. Multivariate analysis of the forest data indicates strong statistical separation of forest types within and between the islands. Current rates of forest growth and change within the Krakatau islands are found to vary considerably. The canopy architecture of Panjang and Sertung is observed to have changed dramatically over the past six years while the pace of change on Rakata appears relatively slow, particularly in the uplands. In an area studied in near-coastal, lowland Rakata, seedling recruitment of Neonauclea calycina is poor and its continued status as an overwhelmingly dominant species must be in question. A slightly more diverse forest appears to be developing below about 120 m elevation, in which Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum is an increasingly important component. Disturbance phenomena, ranging from continuing volcanism to individual tree falls, are found to be critical to an understanding of forest development on the islands. Despite the increasing role of Dysoxylum on Rakata our data indicate a continuing divergence of compositional types within the lowland forest.'

Abstract: 'Dengue is the most common arboviral disease of humans, with more than one third of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population at risk. Accurate prediction of dengue outbreaks may lead to public health interventions that mitigate the effect of the disease. Predicting infectious disease outbreaks is a challenging task; truly predictive methods are still in their infancy.'

Abstract: 'Some Mayan peasant-hunters across the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico still carry out a hunting ritual \xe2\x80\x93Loojil Ts\xe2\x80\x99oon, Loj Ts\xe2\x80\x99oon or Carbine Ceremony\xe2\x80\x93 in which they renew the divine permission for hunting in order to continue deserving the gift of prey after a period of hunt.

Abstract: 'The affinity of iron oxides and hydroxides for phosphorus is thought to contribute to phosphorus limitation to net primary productivity in humid tropical forests on acidic, highly weathered soils. Perennially warm, humid conditions and high biological activity in these soils can result in fluctuating redox potential that in turn leads to considerable iron reduction in the presence of labile carbon and humic substances. We investigated the effects of reducing conditions in combination with the addition of labile carbon substrates (glucose and acetate) and an electron shuttle compound on iron reduction and phosphorus release in a humid tropical forest soil. Glucose or acetate was added to soils as a single dose at the beginning of the experiment, and as pulsed inputs over time, which more closely mimics patterns in labile carbon availability. Iron reduction and phosphorus mobilization were weakly stimulated by a single low level addition of carbon, and the addition of the electron shuttle compound with or without added carbon. Pulsed labile carbon additions produced a significant increase in soil pH, soluble iron, and phosphorus concentrations. Pulsed labile carbon inputs also promoted the precipitation of ferrous hydroxide complexes which could increase the capacity for P sorption, although our results suggest that rates of P solubilization exceeded re-adsorption. Plant and microbial P demand are also likely to serve as an important sinks for released P, limiting the role of P re-adsorption. Our results suggest that reducing conditions coupled with periodic carbon inputs can stimulate iron reduction and a corresponding increase in soil phosphorus mobilization, which may provide a source of phosphorus to plants and microorganisms previously undocumented in these ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Tropical and subtropical plants provide to pollinators a range of nutritive and non-nutritive materials as alternative to pollen and nectar, including resins, which are gathered by females of several groups of social and solitary bees. Although resin-like material has previously been recorded in Maxillariinae, these investigations generally did not present data relating to pollinators. In fact, the collection of resins has never been recorded elsewhere in orchids. The aim of this paper was to provide a detailed study of the reproductive biology of an Amazonian Heterotaxis, H. superflua, based on records of flowering phenology, floral morphology, pollinator behavior and breeding system. Heterotaxis superflua offers resin-like material to pollinators and is pollinated by a single species of stingless bee. The resin is a heterogeneous material rich in mucilage, starch and sugars, while lipoidal substances occur as small droplets. Chemical analyses confirm the presence of sugar, which explain the presence of reducing sugars and mucilage detected in the histochemical investigations. Our data also showed the Heterotaxis is self-compatible and pollinator dependent. This study demonstrates for the first time the collection of resin-like material in orchids. The gathering of resin is frequently associated with the nest construction, since this material is considered to be a water-repellent and has anti-pathogen chemical properties. Despite offering of a floral reward, fruit set under natural conditions is lower than for experimental pollinations, suggesting limited pollen flow within the population.'

Abstract: 'Brazil nut flour (BNF), as a byproduct from Brazil nut water-soluble extract production, has high contents of protein and linoleic acid. The effect of minor variations in water activity (aw) on lipid oxidation and nonenzymatic browning reactions (NBR) rates in BNF has been studied. For that, the tendency of radical formation detected directly by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, formation of lipid hydroperoxides and browning index were measured in samples with initial aw of 0.101 and 0.196 throughout 18 days of storage at 60\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. The tendency of radical formation and the formation of lipid hydroperoxides sharply increased and linearly correlated with browning index for BNF with initial aw of 0.196, but not for BNF with initial aw of 0.101. Furthermore, volatile aroma compounds (VACs) including those from the scission of lipid hydroperoxides and those from the breakage of brown polymeric compounds formed during NBR were determined by HS-SPME\xe2\x80\x93GC\xe2\x80\x93MS analysis and the latter were tentatively identified only in BNF with initial aw of 0.196. Hence, there is indication that the lower the initial aw, the greater the storage stability of BNF. Moreover, lipid oxidation products may have contributed to NBR for BNF with initial aw of 0.196.'

Abstract: 'From the perception of human populations, we can assess the changes occurring in certain landscapes and the factors that cause those changes. Such studies have proven helpful in increasing the knowledge of the history of a landscape, recognizing past formations and projecting its future. Our research objective was to determine how a landscape dominated by the palm tree Attalea speciosa, a species of ecological, economic, and cultural importance, has been changing over time by synthesizing and comparing historical documents and local perceptions. This study was conducted in Araripe Environmental Protection Area, Northeast Region, Brazil. To understand local landscape change, we interviewed active harvesters in four communities in which A. speciosa use has been documented. Historical documents were evaluated as a complement to the interview data. According to local informants, areas previously used for cultivation and animal husbandry that were abandoned or decimated by droughts in the region may have fostered the expansion of a monodominant A. speciosa forest. Furthermore, other forms of landscape management resulting from human population growth may also have affected the current and past distribution of this forest.'

Abstract: 'Closely integrated research between archaeologists and ecologists provides a long-term view of human land use that is rare in the ecological literature, allowing for investigation of activities that lead to enduring environmental outcomes. This extended temporal perspective is particularly important in aridlands where succession occurs slowly and ecosystem processes are mediated by abiotic, geomorphic factors. Numerous studies show that impacts from ancient human actions can persist, but few have explored the types of practices or mechanisms that lead to either transient or long-term environmental change. We compared plant and soil properties and processes from a range of landscape patch types in the Sonoran Desert of the US Southwest that supported different, well-documented prehistoric farming practices from AD 750\xe2\x80\x931300. Our results show that the types of ancient human activities that leave long-term ecological legacies in aridlands are those that fundamentally alter \xe2\x80\x9cslow variables\xe2\x80\x9d such as soil properties that regulate the timing and supply of water. Prehistoric Hohokam floodwater-irrigation practices, but not dryland farming techniques, substantially altered soil texture, which was strongly associated with desert plant community and functional composition. However, prehistoric agriculture did not consistently alter long-term nutrient availability and thus had no impact on \xe2\x80\x9cfast variables\xe2\x80\x9d such as production of seasonal annual plants that are restricted to periods of ample rainfall. In this arid ecosystem, the inverse texture model explained patterns in plant functional composition at large scales, but is less predictive of production of short-lived desert annuals that experience a more mesic precipitation regime.'

Abstract: 'We review recent progress in our understanding of the global cycling of mercury (Hg), including best estimates of Hg concentrations and pool sizes in major environmental compartments and exchange processes within and between these reservoirs. Recent advances include the availability of new global datasets covering areas of the world where environmental Hg data were previously lacking; integration of these data into global and regional models is continually improving estimates of global Hg cycling. New analytical techniques, such as Hg stable isotope characterization, provide novel constraints of sources and transformation processes. The major global Hg reservoirs that are, and continue to be, affected by anthropogenic activities include the atmosphere (4.4\xe2\x80\x935.3 Gt), terrestrial environments (particularly soils: 250\xe2\x80\x931000 Gg), and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., oceans: 270\xe2\x80\x93450 Gg). Declines in anthropogenic Hg emissions between 1990 and 2010 have led to declines in atmospheric Hg0 concentrations and HgII wet deposition in Europe and the US (\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01.5 to \xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa02.2% per year). Smaller atmospheric Hg0 declines (\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa00.2% per year) have been reported in high northern latitudes, but not in the southern hemisphere, while increasing atmospheric Hg loads are still reported in East Asia. New observations and updated models now suggest high concentrations of oxidized HgII in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere where deep convection can scavenge these HgII reservoirs. As a result, up to 50% of total global wet HgII deposition has been predicted to occur to tropical oceans. Ocean Hg0 evasion is a large source of present-day atmospheric Hg (approximately 2900\xc2\xa0Mg/year; range 1900\xe2\x80\x934200\xc2\xa0Mg/year). Enhanced seawater Hg0 levels suggest enhanced Hg0 ocean evasion in the intertropical convergence zone, which may be linked to high HgII deposition. Estimates of gaseous Hg0 emissions to the atmosphere over land, long considered a critical Hg source, have been revised downward, and most terrestrial environments now are considered net sinks of atmospheric Hg due to substantial Hg uptake by plants. Litterfall deposition by plants is now estimated at 1020\xe2\x80\x931230\xc2\xa0Mg/year globally. Stable isotope analysis and direct flux measurements provide evidence that in many ecosystems Hg0 deposition via plant inputs dominates, accounting for 57\xe2\x80\x9394% of Hg in soils. Of global aquatic Hg releases, around 50% are estimated to occur in China and India, where Hg drains into the West Pacific and North Indian Oceans. A first inventory of global freshwater Hg suggests that inland freshwater Hg releases may be dominated by artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM; approximately 880\xc2\xa0Mg/year), industrial and wastewater releases (220\xc2\xa0Mg/year), and terrestrial mobilization (170\xe2\x80\x93300\xc2\xa0Mg/year). For pelagic ocean regions, the dominant source of Hg is atmospheric deposition; an exception is the Arctic Ocean, where riverine and coastal erosion is likely the dominant source. Ocean water Hg concentrations in the North Atlantic appear to have declined during the last several decades but have increased since the mid-1980s in the Pacific due to enhanced atmospheric deposition from the Asian continent. Finally, we provide examples of ongoing and anticipated changes in Hg cycling due to emission, climate, and land use changes. It is anticipated that future emissions changes will be strongly dependent on ASGM, as well as energy use scenarios and technology requirements implemented under the Minamata Convention. We predict that land use and climate change impacts on Hg cycling will be large and inherently linked to changes in ecosystem function and global atmospheric and ocean circulations. Our ability to predict multiple and simultaneous changes in future Hg global cycling and human exposure is rapidly developing but requires further enhancement.'

Abstract: 'Preserved remains of manioc(Manihot) from 6 archaeological sites in the Casma Valley of Peru are illustrated and described. The combined collections from these sites total 197 pieces of root, 32 bark fragments, 22 pieces of stem, 4 capsules, and 2 leaf twigs. Based on radiocarbon assays, the specimens range in age from 1800 B.C. to A.D. 1532. This collection of sweet manioc is unique for its age, number, and wealth of different plant parts. A theory on the place of origin and time of domestication of these ancient cultivars is given in the conclusions of this paper.'

Abstract: 'Loss of mangroves and consequent habitat fragmentation is a major concern throughout the world\xe2\x80\x99s tropical countries. Conversion of mangrove habitat due to aquaculture, agriculture, urbanization and industrialization, ecotourism, overlapping bureaucracy and conflicting policies is occurring at a striking rate. This paper reviews the trends of mangrove area changes in Bangladesh and compares them with four other countries in tropical regions that have significant mangrove areas. The rate of mangrove loss from the 1980 to 2005 was calculated using the compound interest rate formula for its explicit biological implication. In Bangladesh, the area of mangroves was found to have increased due to its higher accretion rate. In India the rate of mangrove loss had fallen. The rate of mangrove loss in Malaysia in the 1990s (\xe2\x88\x920.008 ha\xc2\xb7a\xe2\x88\x921) was higher than the 1980s (\xe2\x88\x920.004 ha\xc2\xb7a\xe2\x88\x921). In Indonesia, the rate decreased, from the 1980s (\xe2\x88\x920.018 ha\xc2\xb7a\xe2\x88\x921) to the 1990s (\xe2\x88\x920.010 ha\xc2\xb7a\xe2\x88\x921). Finally in Myanmar the rate of mangrove loss gradually accelerated. Aquaculture was found to be the common cause of mangrove conversion in the regions. Loss of mangroves is now a prominent global issue, associated with the loss of biodiversity, deterioration of habitat integrity, climatic changes, the amount of carbon sequestration, and resulting sea-level rise. Therefore, a systematic evaluation of these environmental impacts is prerequisite to realize sustainable mangrove management.'

Abstract: 'Results from chronosequences from the arctic to the tropics show that phosphorus (P) availability, total P, and the fraction of bedrock-derived P remaining in soil diminishes as soils age. Thus we predict that ecosystems mantling old substrates are likely to have low available P. Yet there are myriad examples in the biogeochemical literature where the results from chronosequences are used to argue the reverse, and ecosystems observed to be P poor are assumed to mantle an old substrate. This premise is difficult to test, for while the concept of substrate age is useful on uneroded surfaces that formed at a particular time, it becomes obscured in denuding landscapes, where substrate ages instead reflect the rates of rock weathering, denudation  and mixing of dust into soil. Here we explore this premise as it relates to one of the most ubiquitous assumptions in the biogeochemical literature: that the differences in nitrogen (N) and P cycling between temperate and tropical regions are driven by gradients in substrate age. We build a conceptual framework for quantifying the fraction of parent material P remaining in soil ([SoilP]/[RockP]), by estimating P inputs (rock weathering and dust deposition) and outputs (P leaching). We parameterize our model with spatially explicit (0.5\xc2\xb0) estimates of global denudation, weathering zone thickness, and P deposition. To test the assumption that latitudinal gradients in P status are the result of soil age, we apply a single P loss rate, derived from a humid tropical system in the Hawaiian Islands, to our spatially explicit map of soil residence times. Surprisingly, in this formulation, we find only a modest latitudinal gradient in soil P depletion, with mean depletion values in the humid tropics <2\xc3\x97 greater than in the previously unglaciated humid temperate zone. This small latitudinal gradient in P depletion is unlikely to be sufficient to drive the observed differences in tropical vs. temperate ecosystem stoichiometry (e.g. trends in foliar and litter N:P). Thus our results suggest that, to the extent P depletion is greater in the tropics, the appropriate conceptual model for attributing causation may not be one of a chronosequence where time is the primary driver of P loss. We hypothesize that the covariation of inferred P availability with latitude may be strongly controlled by latitudinal changes in rates of P leaching and occlusion, rather than gradients in substrate age.'

Abstract: 'Flood tolerance is commonly regarded as the main factor explaining low diversity and monodominance in tropical swamps. In this study we examined seedling mortality in relation to seasonality, i.e., flooding versus drought, of the dominant tree species (Prioria copaifera), and three associated species (Pterocarpus officinalis, Carapa guianensis and Pentaclethra macroloba), in seasonally flooded forests (SFF) in Darien, Panama. Seedling mortality differed among species, years and seasons. Prioria seedlings experienced the lowest overall mortality, and after 3\xc2\xa0years many more Prioria seedlings remained alive than those of any of the associated species. In general, within species, larger seedlings had greater survival. Seed size, which can vary by close to 2 orders of magnitude in Prioria, had a confounding effect with that of topography. Large-seeded Prioria seedlings experienced 1.5 times greater mortality than small-seeded seedlings, as large-seeded Prioria seedlings were more likely to be located in depressions. This finding suggests that seed size, plant size and topography are important in understanding SFF regeneration. For all species, seedling mortality was consistently greater during the dry season than during flooding. For Prioria, dry season seedling mortality was correlated with drought stress, that is, high mortality during the long El Ni\xc3\xb1o dry season of 1998 and the normal dry season of 2000, but very low dry season mortality during the mild dry season of 1999. Prioria\xe2\x80\x99s ability to dominate in seasonally flooded forest of Central America is partly explained by its low drought-related mortality in comparison to associated species.'

Abstract: 'The study of habitat fragmentation is complex because multiple, potentially synergistic, ecological processes may be acting simultaneously. Further, edge effects themselves may be complex in that additivity from multiple edges can give rise to heterogeneous nearest\xe2\x80\x93edge gradients.'

Abstract: 'Soil is fragile and nonrenewable but the most basic of natural resources. It has a capacity to tolerate continuous use but only with proper management. Improper soil management and indiscriminate use of chemicals have contributed to some severe global environmental issues, e.g., volatilization losses and contamination of natural waters by sediments and agricultural fertilizers and pesticides. The increasing substitution of energy for labor and other cultural inputs in agriculture is another issue. Fertilizers and chemicals account for about 25% of the production energy investment in agriculture. An additional 60% is accounted for by machinery, gasoline, electricity, and power-related inputs. Fertilizer additions to cropland are not utilized fully and significant amounts, depending on conditions, are either lost in surface runoff or leached into the ground water. The annual discharge of dissolved solids from agricultural lands to the waterways in the USA is substantial. The increasing use of herbicides in agriculture is a threat to the quality of surface and ground water, although this threat is dependent upon both the chemistry of the compound and the ecosystem in which it is used. Especially within the Third World, development of an environmental ethic and environmental laws have not kept pace with the increase in pesticide use. Above all is the severe and global problem of soil degradation currently occurring at the rate of five to seven million hectares per year. The policy and moral aspects of these issues are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Indigenous and rural societies who have contributed least to anthropogenic climate change are facing its harshest consequences. One of the greatest challenges of climate change is lack of predictability, especially at the local scale. An estimated 70-80% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s food is produced by small-holders with less than two hectares of land (FAO 2014; Lowder et al. 2016). These small-scale farmers and herders face an ever-shifting \xe2\x80\x98new normal\xe2\x80\x99 climate, increasing inconsistency in the seasonality of temperature and precipitation, and higher frequency of what were once considered extreme weather events (Jolly et al. 2002; Thornton et al. 2014).

Anticipatory capacity \xe2\x80\x93 the ability to envision possible futures and develop a plan of action to deal with uncertainties \xe2\x80\x93 is needed urgently (Tschakert and Dietrich 2010).'

Abstract: 'This research aims to identify the essence of the Polish national brand and the way Polish culture is being communicated through the national brand. Having conducted both quantitative and qualitative research into the cultural symbols of the nation and their representations within and outside of Poland, the findings show a discrepancy between what is perceived as the national brand within Poland, the way the brand is communicated, and the way the brand is perceived outside of the country. The paper concludes with some reflections upon the relationship between national brand and national culture, and how this could be better managed.'

Abstract: 'Lung cancer constitutes one of the malignancies with the greatest incidence and mortality rates with 1.6 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths each year. Prognosis remains poor due to deleterious development of multidrug resistance resulting in less than 15% lung cancer patients reaching five years survival. We have previously shown that Phyllanthus induced apoptosis in conjunction with its antimetastastic action. In the current study, we aimed to determine the signaling pathways utilized by Phyllanthus to exert its antimetastatic activities.'

Abstract: 'The intellectual property rights debate focuses on the flow of germplasm from developing tropical countries to developed temperate nations. Few investigators have addressed the converse. We discuss the abundance and importance of introduced plants in pharmacopoeias of northern South America. Introduced species commonly are employed as medicines throughout the region and include at least 216 Eurasian, North American, African, and Pacific species. Among the Shuar of lowland Ecuador, four introduced plants (Citrus aurantium, Cymbopogon citratus, Saccharum officinarum, and Zingiber officinale) are included in their most commonly prescribed remedies. The widespread use of introduced plants is due, in part, to the medicinal value of plants whose primary use is for food (e.g., Musa X paradisiacal Similarly, many introduced ornamentals also have therapeutic value (e.g., Hedychium coronarium). Other species have been introduced specifically as medicines (e.g., Aloe vera). Restrictions on the flow of germplasm and plant knowledge may protect the economic interests of governments and national industry. If applied bilaterally, however, constraints on the movement of plants will limit the continued evolution of traditional medicinal systems in areas where they are most needed.'

Abstract: 'The Brazilian Savanna, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cCerrado\xe2\x80\x9d, is the richest and most diverse savanna in the world and has been ranked as one of the main hotspots of biodiversity. The Cerrado is a representative biome in Central Brazil and the second largest biome in species diversity of South America. Nevertheless, large areas of native vegetation have been converted to agricultural land including grain production, livestock, and forestry. In this view, understanding how land use affects microbial communities is fundamental for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems. The aim of this work was to analyze and compare the soil bacterial communities from the Brazilian Cerrado associated with different land use systems using high throughput pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Relevant differences were observed in the abundance and structure of bacterial communities in soils under different land use systems. On the other hand, the diversity of bacterial communities was not relevantly changed among the sites studied. Land use systems had also an important impact on specific bacterial groups in soil, which might change the soil function and the ecological processes. Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant groups in the Brazilian Cerrado. These findings suggest that more important than analyzing the general diversity is to analyze the composition of the communities. Since soil type was the same among the sites, we might assume that land use was the main factor defining the abundance and structure of bacterial communities.'

Abstract: 'Archaeological approaches to social boundaries are currently emphasizing the dynamic nature of processes thought which individuals construct, maintain, and negotiate their identity. Although the integration of such concepts has led to a more accurate reconstruction of past social boundaries, it has also revealed a need for more sophisticated ways of interpreting material culture. This paper is a step in that direction. Focusing on pottery cha\xc3\xaenes op\xc3\xa9ratoires and addressing questions about the salience and scale of particular behaviors, I seek to develop general propositions regarding the relationships between technological styles and aspects of social identity. To that end, I compare African pottery techniques at a subcontinental level and see whether there are recurrent patterns in their distribution and whether these can be related to specific social boundaries or historical processes of group formation.'

Abstract: 'During the 1950s, there was a burst of enthusiasm about whether artificial intelligence might surpass human intelligence. Since then, technology has changed society so dramatically that the focus of study has shifted toward society\xe2\x80\x99s ability to adapt to technological change. Technology and rapid communications weaken the capacity of society to integrate into the broader social structure those people who have had little or no access to education. (Most of the recent use of communications by the excluded has been disruptive, not integrative.) Interweaving of socioeconomic activity and large-scale systems had a dehumanizing effect on people excluded from social participation by these trends. Jobs vanish at an accelerating rate. Marketing creates demand for goods which stress the global environment, even while the global environment no longer yields readily accessible resources. Mining and petroleum firms push into ever more challenging environments (e.g., deep mines and seabed mining) to meet resource demands. These activities are expensive, and resource prices rise rapidly, further excluding groups that cannot pay for these resources. The impact of large-scale systems on society leads to mass idleness, with the accompanying threat of violent reaction as unemployed masses seek to blame both people in power as well as the broader social structure for their plight. Perhaps, the impact of large-scale systems on society has already eroded essential qualities of humanness. Humans, when they feel \xe2\x80\x9csocially useless,\xe2\x80\x9d are dehumanized. (At the same time, machines (at any scale) seem incapable of emotion or empathy.) Has the cost of technological progress been too high to pay? These issues are addressed in this paper.'

Abstract: 'Here, we report fossil leaves, woods, and pollen grains comparable to Calophyllum L. (mainly to Calophyllum inophyllum L. and Calophyllum polyanthum Wall. ex Choisy) of Calophyllaceae from the upper (Kimin Formation, late Pliocene-early Pleistocene),  middle (Subansiri Formation, Pliocene) Siwalik sediments of the Arunachal sub-Himalaya, and lower (Gish Clay Formation of Sevok Group; middle to late Miocene) Siwalik sediments of the Darjeeling foothills, eastern Himalaya. Their presence indicates a warm and humid tropical environment in the region during the period of Siwalik sedimentation. Considering all records of Calophyllum, it is suggested that Calophyllum was a frequent forest element throughout the period of Siwalik sedimentation during the Neogene (Miocene time). At present, C. polyanthum grows in the eastern Himalaya, but C. inophyllum is totally absent from north-eastern regions suggesting differential adaptability of these taxa to changing ecoclimatic conditions. Distinct climate change in the area, possibly related to the Himalayan Orogeny during Miocene\xe2\x80\x93Pleistocene times, might have caused the disappearance of C. inophyllum from the entire eastern Himalaya and north-east Indian plains and a move to littoral/coastal and swampy forests of India and other adjoining south-east Asian regions, Polynesia, and the east coast of Africa. The past global distribution of Calophyllum is also discussed, and it is suggested that India may have been its primary centre of origin. This is the first time Cenozoic fossil leaves Calophyllum siwalikum Khan, R.A.Spicer & Bera, sp. nov. comparable to C. inophyllum are described using the both macro- and micromorphological characters.'

Abstract: 'How to wean humanity off the use of fossil fuels continues to receive much attention but how to replace these fuels with renewable sources of energy has become a contentious field of debate as well as research, which often reflects economic and political factors rather than scientific good sense. It is clear that not every advertized energy source can lead to a sustainable, humane and environment-friendly path out of a future energy crisis. Our proposal is based on two assertions: that the use of food crops for biofuels is immoral, and that for this purpose using land suitable for growing crops productively is to be avoided. We advocate a focus on new \xe2\x80\x9cextremophile\xe2\x80\x9d crops. These would either be wild species adapted to extreme environments which express genes, developmental processes and metabolic pathways that distinguish them from traditional crops or existing crops genetically modified to withstand extreme environments. Such extremophile energy crops (EECs), will be less susceptible to stresses in a changing global environment and provide higher yields than existing crops. Moreover, they will grow on land that has never been valuable for agriculture or is no longer so, owing to centuries or millennia of imprudent exploitation. Such a policy will contribute to striking a balance between ecosystem protection and human resource management. Beyond that, rather than bulk liquid fuel generation, combustion of various biomass sources including extremophiles for generating electrical energy, and photovoltaics-based capture of solar energy, are superbly suitable candidates for powering the world in the future. Generating electricity and efficient storage capacity is quite possibly the only way for a sustainable post-fossil and, indeed, post-biofuel fuel economy.'

Abstract: 'The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are among a rare group of ice-free regions lying along the coast of an otherwise ice-burdened continent. For Antarctica, these are highly atypical regions of exposed rock and barren soils. Within their 4,000\xc2\xa0km2 expanse, the valleys contain a number of permanently ice-covered, closed-basin lakes, which range from freshwater to highly saline environments. This paper examines the physical structure, geochemistry, nutrient and trace metal dynamics, biology, and hydrologic history of saline Lake Bonney (both east and west lobes), Fryxell, Vanda, and Joyce and provides an update to recently published volumes on these pristine systems.'

Abstract: 'This article presents examples that illustrate how teachers use children\xe2\x80\x99s literature in the teaching of mathematics.

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x9cIf only they had chosen to develop natural product drugs in a sustainable manner at the turn of the century\xe2\x80\x9d. In 2050, when the Earth has a population of at least 9 billion, will this be our legacy as the world contemplates the costs and availability of synthetic and gene-based products for primary health care? For most people in the world, plants, in their various forms, remain a primary source of health care. However, in the developed countries, natural products derived from plants assume a very minor role as prescription and over-the-counter products, even with the widespread use of phytotherapeutical preparations. With the continuing decline of natural products in large scale, ultrahigh-throughput screening programs in pharmaceutical industry, and acknowledging the recent history of the relationship between humankind and the Earth, it is essential that we consider what are the health care issues that we are leaving for our descendants? Where do our responsibilities as global citizens and scientists coalesce? What is the vision for natural product research that we must create now in order to maintain the choices of drug discovery and pharmaceutical development for future generations? In order to assist us in creating this vision, we will examine some facets of how natural products must be involved globally in a sustainable manner for improving health care. We will discuss access to the biome, the acquisition, analysis and dissemination of plant knowledge, the safety and efficacy of traditional plant remedies, analytical and biotechnology development, and natural product structure diversification and drug discovery potential. Finally, we will address the question of who will fund this vision?'

Abstract: 'The Felidae family represents a challenge for molecular phylogenetic reconstruction because it consists of 38 living species that evolved from a relatively recent common ancestor (10\xe2\x80\x9315 million years ago). We have determined mitochondrial DNA sequences from two genes that evolve at relatively rapid evolutionary rates, 16S rRNA (379 bp) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (NADH-5, 318 bp), from multiple individuals of 35 species. Based on separate and combined gene analyses using minimum evolution, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods, we recognized eight significant clusters or species clades that likely reflect separate monophyletic evolutionary radiations in the history of this family. The clusters include (1) ocelot lineage, (2) domestic cat lineage, (3) Panthera genus, (4) puma group, (5) Lynx genus, (6) Asian leopard cat group, (7) caracal group, and (8) bay cat group. The results confirm and extend previously hypothesized associations in most cases, but in others, e.g., the bay cat group, suggest novel phylogenetic relationships. The results are compared and evaluated with molecular, cytogenetic, and morphological data to derive a phylogenetic synthesis of field evolutionary history.'

Abstract: 'In this review paper, we aim to describe the potential for, and the key challenges to, applying PES projects to mangroves. By adopting a \xe2\x80\x9ccarbocentric approach,\xe2\x80\x9d we show that mangrove forests are strong candidates for PES projects. They are particularly well suited to the generation of carbon credits because of their unrivaled potential as carbon sinks, their resistance and resilience to natural hazards, and their extensive provision of Ecosystem Services other than carbon sequestration, primarily nursery areas for fish, water purification and coastal protection, to the benefit of local communities as well as to the global population. The voluntary carbon market provides opportunities for the development of appropriate protocols and good practice case studies for mangroves at a small scale, and these may influence larger compliance schemes in the future. Mangrove habitats are mostly located in developing countries on communally or state-owned land. This means that issues of national and local governance, land ownership and management, and environmental justice are the main challenges that require careful planning at the early stages of mangrove PES projects to ensure successful outcomes and equitable benefit sharing within local communities.'

Abstract: ' Cecropia is a pioneer genus from the Neotropics, whilst Macaranga is an ecological analog with a center of distribution in Southeast Asia. In the past few decades, introduced populations of Cecropia spp. have spread rapidly in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In Singapore, Cecropia pachystachya now occupies habitats that would have been expected to be occupied by Macaranga gigantea. We conducted germination experiments under 0, 20, 50, and 70\xc2\xa0% shading and measured the survival rates and functional traits of the seedlings of these two species from material collected in Singapore. Seeds of C. pachystachya germinated in 3\xe2\x80\x9312\xc2\xa0days, whereas seeds of M. gigantea germinated from day 13 onwards. Germination success for C. pachystachya was between 90.3\xc2\xa0% under full-light conditions and 55.8\xc2\xa0% under 50\xc2\xa0% shading, while for M. gigantea only 69.1\xc2\xa0% of seed germinated under full-light conditions and germination completely failed when seeds were shaded by 20\xc2\xa0% or more. The seedlings of C. pachystachya also had higher survival rates, faster shoot and root biomass accumulation, larger leaves, and lower total water content than those of M. gigantea. Thus overall, C. pachystachya possesses traits that may provide a competitive edge over the native M. gigantea and will be advantageous for its spread given the increasing proliferation of disturbed landscapes in tropical Southeast Asia.'

Abstract: 'Global heating is happening. The opportunity to prevent it has been missed. Originating in the Industrial Revolution, the ever greater use of fossil fuels impacts the entire world \xe2\x80\x93 especially future generations, who contribute nothing to the problem and who have no say today. The near-universal consensus is that the accumulation in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases heats the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate, that an increase above 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C imperils the basis of human life, and that one beyond 3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C threatens its destruction. Global heating is the flipside of the phenomenal economic and demographic development of the past half century. Ever more people are enjoying, or pursuing, ever more comfortable and mobile lifestyles, the cumulative effect is to push the Earth beyond its carrying capacity. Recognizing these dangers, the 2015 Paris Agreement was a major achievement \xe2\x80\x93 but not good enough, because chances are slim that it will be realized and, even if it were, it would not suffice. Global heating is beyond individual or national remedial action. Organizing decarbonization at the proper scale and speed is the formidable global public policy challenge on which the survival of the human species depends. Can governments deliver? And what, if they can\xe2\x80\x99t?'

Abstract: 'Currently, about 400 million hectares of tropical moist forests worldwide are designated production forests, about a quarter of which are managed by rural communities and indigenous peoples. There has been a gradual impoverishment of forest resources inside selectively logged forests in which the volume of timber extracted over the first cutting cycle was mostly from large, old trees that matured over a century or more and grew in the absence of strong anthropological pressures. In forests now being logged for a second and third time, that volume has not been reconstituted due in part to the lack of implementation of post-logging silvicultural treatments. This depletion of timber stocks renders the degraded forests prone to conversion to other land uses. Although it is essential to preserve undisturbed primary forests through the creation of protected areas, these areas alone will not be able to ensure the conservation of all species on a pan-tropical scale, for social, economic and political reasons. The conservation of tropical forests of tomorrow will mostly take place within human-modified (logged, domesticated) forests. In this context, silvicultural interventions are considered by many tropical foresters and forest ecologists as tools capable of effectively conserving tropical forest biodiversity and ecosystem services while stimulating forest production. This systematic review aims to assess past and current evidence of the impact of silviculture on tropical forests and to identify silvicultural practices appropriate for the current conditions in the forests and forestry sectors of the Congo Basin, Amazonia and Southeast Asia.'

Abstract: 'Planted forests are increasingly contributing wood products and other ecosystem services at a global scale. These forests will be even more important as carbon markets develop and REDD-plus forest programs (forests used specifically to reduce atmospheric emissions of CO2 through deforestation and forest degradation) become common. Restoring degraded and deforested areas with long-rotation planted forests can be accomplished in a manner that enhances carbon storage and other key ecosystem services. Knowledge from natural systems and understanding the functioning novel of ecosystems can be instructive for planning and restoring future forests. Here we summarize information pertaining to the mechanisms by which biodiversity functions to provide ecosystem services including: production, pest control, pollination, resilience, nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, and water quality and quantity and suggest options to improve planted forest management, especially for REDD-plus.'

Abstract: 'Anthropogenic factors constitute the primary deterministic causes of species declines, endangerment and extinction: land development, overexploitation, species translocations and introductions, and pollution. The primary anthropogenic factors produce ecological and genetic effects contributing to extinction risk. Ecological factors include environmental stochasticity, random catastrophes, and metapopulation dynamics (local extinction and colonization) that are intensified by habitat destruction and fragmentation. Genetic factors include hybridization with nonadapted gene pools, and selective breeding and harvesting. In small populations stochastic factors are especially important, including the ecological factors of Allee effect, edge effects, and demographic stochasticity, and the genetic factors of inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variability, and fixation of new deleterious mutations. All factors affecting extinction risk are expressed, and can be evaluated, through their operation on population dynamics.'

Abstract: 'We characterized dung beetles food preference and diel activity and examined the way such characteristics may structure a Scarabaeinae community in a dry forest. We sampled a fragment of Arboreal Caatinga in Milagres, Bahia, Brazil, during the dry and wet seasons, using baited pitfall (bovine spleen, human feces, cow dung, and rotten banana). Species were classified by activity (nocturnal and diurnal) and food preference (coprophagous, necrophagous, saprophagous, copro-necrophagous, and generalist). In total, 1,581 individuals belonging to 16 morphospecies were sampled, with six new records for Caatinga. The dung beetles were mainly from generalist and coprophagous species; seven species presented nocturnal activity, and five were diurnal. There was higher species richness during the day and greater abundance during the night. Species composition differences were influenced by functional guilds and beetle size according to temporal segregation. These factors may be related to physiological, morphological, and behavioral differences.'

Abstract: 'Permanent sample plots (PSP), where trees are individually and permanently marked, have received increased interest in Central Africa as a tool to monitor vegetation changes. Although techniques for mounting PSP in tropical forests are well known, their planning still deserves attention. This study aims at defining a rationale for determining the size and number of replicates for setting up PSP in mixed tropical forests. It considers PSP as a sampling plan to estimate a target quantity with its associated margin of error. The target quantity considered here is the stock recovery rate, which is a key parameter for forest management in Central Africa. It is computed separately for each commercial species. The number of trees to monitor for each species defines the margin of error on the stock recovery rate. The size and number of replicated plots is obtained as the solution of an optimization problem that consists in minimizing the margin of error for every species while ensuring that the mounting cost remains below a given threshold. This rationale was applied using the data from the M\xe2\x80\x99Ba\xc3\xafki experimental site in the Central African Republic. It showed that the stock recovery rate is a highly variable quantity, and that the typical cost that forest managers are prone to devote to PSP leads to high margins of error. It also showed that the size and number of replicated plots is related to the spatial pattern of trees: clustered or spatially heterogeneous patterns favor many small plots, whereas regular or spatially homogeneous patterns favor few large plots.'

Abstract: 'Global governance and sustainable development may be at odds with each other if the former implies highly centralized forms of natural resource management. Proponents of international regulation of trade in animal and plant parts argue that the dictates of environmental necessity outweigh the concerns of those to whom this regulation represents a fundamental imposition upon their way of life and economic opportunities. More specifically, such regulation (represented primarily by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) is necessary because the value of biodiversity must supersede that of cultural tradition and economic opportunity costs associated with either refraining from trade or enforcing trade bans/regulation. Critics charge this is a western-oriented approach that fails to take into account the need for international trade in order to sustain local enthusiasm for trade limitations in southern states and amongst indigenous communities in the south. This paper will analyze this debate, with reference to CITES, and suggest that the need for habitat protection may be the only way to close the divide between hardened ideological positions.'

Abstract: "Humans are making increasing demands on natural ecosystems. One recent study has concluded that our species is consuming or diverting some 40% of the net photosynthetic productivity of our planet. Many habitats are being converted to simpler systems which provide more harvestable goods to people. As a result, genetic diversity, species and whole ecosystems are disappearing; some scientists suggest that as many as 25% of the world's species could be lost in the next several decades."

Abstract: 'We studied the food and habitat preferences of beetles of the subfamily Scarabaeinae in a protected tropical monsoon forest, theWasgomuwa National Park in Sri Lanka. While gaining an insight into the capacity of different resources to support dung beetles, we tested the hypothesis that, in a landscape with a mosaic of habitat types and a diversity of large mammals, specialization facilitates coexistence of the scarabs. Pitfall traps were laid in five distinct habitat types (forest, riverine, sandy banks, scrub and grassland), and baitedwith five dung types (leopard, cervid, elephant, bear and buffalo). Four hundred and fifty seven beetles of 22 species in seven genera were recorded. Significant differences were seen in the species richness and abundance of dung beetles between different habitats and dung types, indicating habitat and food preferences. The highest richness of scarabs was in the riverine habitat and in leopard dung. Niche breath values of the individual species indicated differences in the degrees of specialization, while niche overlap values indicated a greater sharing of dung beetle species between similar habitats and dung types than between dissimilar ones. These findings provide evidence that selectivity of habitat, and dung, may be important in promoting coexistence among the scarabs in a tropical environment.'

Abstract: 'Establishing secure tenure is widely recognized as a fundamental component of sustainable forest management. Policy-makers generally prefer privatization to achieve these ends, although common property institutions may also be appropriate. But if common property tenure is insecure and fails to control exploitation, theory predicts that private tenure should lead to better forest conditions. In this case study of a western Honduras community, forest mensuration data were collected from four private forests and two relatively open access common property forests. Statistical analyses failed to find consistent, significant differences in vegetation structure or soils related to tenure. Notable contrasts between forests reflected historical conditions and owner preferences. Neither form of tenure appeared to emphasize concerns for sustainable management, and ongoing processes of change constrained the possibility for limiting common property forest exploitation. The study adds to others which show that the outcomes of private or common property tenure relate substantially to the socioeconomic, political, and ecological context.'

Abstract: 'In tropical seasonal semideciduous forests (TSSF), plants face alternating drought or light shortage in dry and rainy seasons, respectively. To understand how emergent trees deal with seasonality across ontogeny, we sampled all individuals of the widely distributed species Astronium graveolens Jacq. (Anacardiaceae) in 100 random plots (10\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0m each) in a TSSF fragment in southeastern Brazil, and conducted greenhouse experiments on photosynthetic and gas exchange responses to drought and shade. We recognized six ontogenetic stages by external structures, and analyzed height-diameter allometry and biomechanical design across ontogeny. Trade-offs were inferred in early life (increasing height, diameter, or leaf number implied smaller leaves; height growth implied less leaf production) and in mid-life (height or diameter growth implied no branch production). The population did not adjust to a biomechanical model, implying a growth pathway between pioneer and canopy species. All stages were biomechanically stable, and the safety factor decreased with height. In adult trees, the asymptotic height indicated water limitation. In young plants, drought did not affect gas exchange. Light\xe2\x80\x93shadow experiments suggested a trade-off between shoot and root growth. Our results indicate how a light-demanding emergent tree balances trade-offs across ontogeny to deal with seasonally alternating water or light shortage.'

Abstract: 'Using a history-inspired game theoretic approach, the paper shows how dictatorship and pro-ethnic voting under democracy, in a society characterized by bi-communal polarization, can result in sub-optimal economic performance. The relatively poor economic outcome is facilitated by an adverse institutional construct, the constitution, which inadvertently encourages low intensity but persistent ethnic rivalry. Mutual distrust in how the other side will vote on the day of secret ballot induces the members of each group to vote for their respective elites, hence non-cooperation. The model is extended to include Gintis\xe2\x80\x99 psychic gain parameter that shows cooperation is possible in the prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 dilemma framework. The latter theoretical result implies a policy proposal of constitutional reform that promotes inter-group cooperation of the distribution of economic resources.'

Abstract: 'The causes and consequences of mammoth extinction and the disappearance of the mammoth fauna in the late Quaternary period and during the Holocene are considered. With the vast distribution ranges of mammoths (almost the whole Holarctic), climatic factors could not be the initial reason for their extinction. The hypothesis of huge ice sheets is getting ever more contradictory and cannot be accepted. Since the mammoth extinction coincided with the time of Homo sapiens expansion around the world (together with the dog, a domesticated wolf), the elimination of the mammoth by hunters is probable. Presumably, the domestication of wolf was the major factor that increased hunting efficiency and safety in prehistoric times, as well as the life span of hunters and their spare time, allowing for improvement of tools, arms, and skills and the development of ancient art and culture. Since mammoths were the main edificators of the pasture ecosystems in the Holarctic, their extinction, together with other large phytophages, entailed the destruction of pasture ecosystems over vast areas and the formation of the current \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d zones by the end of the Holocene. With the domestication of wolf, the anthropogenic factor becomes decisive for the further fate of pasture ecosystems, while climatic fluctuations during ocean regressions and transgressions either inhibited or enhanced its impact. The destruction of the initial structure of pasture ecosystems over most of the mammoth distribution range and its alteration could not be climatically neutral.'

Abstract: 'The protected areas of Bolivia cover 10.2% of its territory, but only 60% of this surface is considered to be of conservation value. Protected areas are unevenly distributed over the eight phyto-geographic regions of Bolivia. The Pantanal is not represented in any conservation unit. Inventories and basic information are usually lacking as plant surveys have been carried out mostly outside protected areas.'

Abstract: 'Accurate and continuous monitoring of forest production is critical for quantifying the dynamics of regional-to-global carbon cycles. MOD17A2 provides high frequency observations of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) and is widely used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability and responses to changing climate. However, the effectiveness of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in measuring GPP is directly constrained by the large uncertainties in the modeling process, specifically for complicated and extensive forest ecosystems. Although there have been plenty of studies to verify the MODIS GPP product with ground-based measurements covering a range of biome types, few have comprehensively validated the performance of MODIS estimates (C5.5) for diverse forests. Thus, this study examined the degree of correspondence between the MODIS-derived GPP and the EC-measured GPP at seasonal and interannual time scales for the main forest ecosystems, encompassing evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF), evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF), deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), and mixed forest (MF) relying on 16 flux towers with a total dataset of 68 site-years. Overall, the site-specific evaluation of multi-year mean annual GPP estimates indicates that the current MODIS product works more significantly for DBF and MF, less for ENF, and least for EBF. Except for the tropical forest, MODIS estimates could capture the broad trends of GPP at an 8-day time scale for the other sites. At the seasonal time scale, the highest performance was observed in ENF, followed by MF and DBF, and the least performance was observed in EBF. Trend analyses also revealed the weak performance in EBF and DBF. This study suggested that current MODIS GPP estimates still need to improve the quality of different upstream inputs in addition to the algorithm for accurately quantifying forest production.'

Abstract: 'Biomass burning, in a broad sense, encompasses different burning practices, including open and confined burnings, and different types of vegetation. Emission factors of gaseous or particulate trace compounds are directly dependent both on the fuel type and the combustion process. Emission factors are generally calculated by stoichiometric considerations using the carbon mass balance method, applied either to combustion chamber experiments or to field experiments based on ground-level measurements or aircraft sampling in smoke plumes. There have been a number of experimental studies in the last 10 years to investigate wildfires in tropical, temperate, or boreal regions. This article presents an overview of measurement methods and experimental data on emission factors of reactive or radiatively active trace compounds, including trace gases and particles. It focuses on fires in tropical regions, that is, forest and savanna fires, agricultural burns, charcoal production, use of fuelwood, and charcoal combustion.'

Abstract: 'Habitat loss, landscape fragmentation, and agriculture intensification constitute the main threats to bees. As the organisms responsible for almost one third of the food produced worldwide, there are growing concerns on bees\xe2\x80\x99 response to human-related disturbances. Among all bee groups, orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) compose an interesting group to test landscape-related hypotheses. In here, we tested the effect of landscape features (amount of anthropic areas and isolation) on the probability of occurrence and the abundances of both Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier and Eufriesea auriceps Friese in the Cerrado savanna. In general, we did not observe any effect of landscape features on the probability of occurrence and abundances of both species in our sampling sites. Given their potential high dispersal abilities, these bee species may be less sensitive to fragmented landscapes or even positively affected by the increase of anthropic habitats. Since we sampled many E. nigrita specimens in highly preserved Cerrado savanna areas, we believe that at least for this biome, this species may not be a good indicator of landscape disturbance.'

Abstract: 'Myrmecophytes (ant\xe2\x80\x93plants) have special hollow structures (domatia) in which obligate ant partners nest. As the ants live only on the plants and feed exclusively on plant food bodies, sap-sucking homopterans in the domatia, and/or the homopteran\xe2\x80\x99s honeydew, they are suitable for the study of colony size regulation by food. We examined factors regulating ant colony size in four myrmecophytic Macaranga species, which have strictly species-specific association with Crematogaster symbiont ants. Intra- and interspecific comparison of the plants showed that the ant biomass per unit food biomass was constant irrespective of plant developmental stage and plant species, suggesting that the ant colony size is limited by food supply. The primary food offered by the plants to the ants was different among Macaranga species. Ants in Macaranga beccariana and Macaranga bancana relied on homopterans rather than food bodies, and appeared to regulate the homopteran biomass and, as a consequence, regulate the ants\xe2\x80\x99 own biomass. In contrast, ants in Macaranga winkleri and Macaranga trachyphylla relied primarily on food bodies rather than homopterans, and the plants appeared to manipulate the ant colony size. Per capita plant investment in ants (ant dry weight plant dry weight\xe2\x88\x921) was different among the four Macaranga species. The homoptera-dependent M. beccariana and M. bancana harbored lower biomass of ants than the food-body dependent M. winkleri, suggesting that energy loss is involved in the homoptera-interposing symbiotic system which has one additional trophic level. The plants\xe2\x80\x99 investment ratio to the ants generally decreased as plants grew. The evolution of the plant reward-offering system in ant\xe2\x80\x93plant\xe2\x80\x93homopteran symbioses is discussed with an emphasis on the role of homopterans.'

Abstract: 'Impact of extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was analyzed in a thorn scrub forest in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) wildlife sanctuary, India. Six species are most commonly extracted from BRT scrub for subsistence and income generation by an aboriginal tribe, the Soliga. Although the forest has been provided protection from indiscriminate felling since 1978 under a wildlife sanctuary cover, changes in vegetation structure are still occurring as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of fuelwood and other NTFPs. The results indicate that large woody species are being replaced by small woody species. The population structure also is becoming increasingly skewed to the smaller size classes due to extraction-bound mortality of the individuals, particularly those>7 cm dbh and above. The data suggest that the scrub community itself may be a manifestation of long persisting anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of a variety of forest products, and it currently represents a downward transition from a deciduous forest to a shrub thicket.'

Abstract: ' Existing climate data for Bolivian Amazonia rely on observations from a few sparse weather stations, interpolated on coarse-resolution grids. At the same time, the region hosts numerous indigenous groups with rich knowledge systems that are hitherto untapped in the quest to understand local climate change. Drawing on an empirical dataset of climate change observations by an Amazonian native society, we assess the potential use of indigenous knowledge for complementing available climate data. We find indigenous observations to be robustly associated with local station data for climatic changes over the last five decades. By contrast, there are discrepancies between gridded climate data and both indigenous observations and local station observations. Indigenous knowledge can be instrumental to enhance our understanding of local climate in data-deficient regions. Indigenous observations offer a tool to ground-truth gridded descriptions of climatic changes, thereby making adaptation strategies more robust at local scales. We contend that the use of indigenous knowledge could help to assist the climate interpolation process and address the prevailing uncertainties in local assessments of climate change.'

Abstract: 'Forests play a leading role in regional and global carbon (C) cycles. Detailed assessment of the temporal and spatial changes in C sinks/sources of China\xe2\x80\x99s forests is critical to the estimation of the national C budget and can help to constitute sustainable forest management policies for climate change. In this study, we explored the spatio-temporal changes in forest biomass C stocks in China between 1977 and 2008, using six periods of the national forest inventory data. According to the definition of the forest inventory, China\xe2\x80\x99s forest was categorized into three groups: forest stand, economic forest, and bamboo forest. We estimated forest biomass C stocks for each inventory period by using continuous biomass expansion factor (BEF) method for forest stands, and the mean biomass density method for economic and bamboo forests. As a result, China\xe2\x80\x99s forests have accumulated biomass C (i.e., biomass C sink) of 1896 Tg (1 Tg=1012 g) during the study period, with 1710, 108 and 78 Tg C in forest stands, and economic and bamboo forests, respectively. Annual forest biomass C sink was 70.2 Tg C a\xe2\x88\x921, offsetting 7.8% of the contemporary fossil CO2 emissions in the country. The results also showed that planted forests have functioned as a persistent C sink, sequestrating 818 Tg C and accounting for 47.8% of total C sink in forest stands, and that the old-, mid- and young-aged forests have sequestrated 930, 391 and 388 Tg C from 1977 to 2008. Our results suggest that China\xe2\x80\x99s forests have a big potential as biomass C sink in the future because of its large area of planted forests with young-aged growth and low C density.'

Abstract: 'Habitat structure and anthropogenic disturbance are known to affect primate diversity and abundance. However, researchers have focused on lowland rain forests, whereas endangered deciduous forests have been neglected. We aimed to investigate the relationships between primate diversity and abundance and habitat parameters in 10 deciduous forest fragments southeast of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. We obtained primate data via line-transect surveys and visual and acoustic observations. In addition, we assessed the vegetation structure (canopy height, understory density), size, isolation time, and surrounding forest area of the fragments. We interpreted our results in the context of the historical distribution data for primates in the area before fragmentation and interviews with local people. We detected 5 of the 8 historically observed primate species: Alouatta caraya, Aotus azarae boliviensis, Callithrix melanura, Callicebus donacophilus, and Cebus libidinosus juruanus. Total species number and detection rates decreased with understory density. Detection rates also negatively correlated with forest areas in the surroundings of a fragment, which may be due to variables not assessed, i.e., fragment shape, distance to nearest town. Observations for Alouatta and Aotus were too few to conduct further statistics. Cebus and Callicebus were present in 90% and 70% of the sites, respectively, and their density did not correlate with any of the habitat variables assessed, signaling high ecological plasticity and adaptability to anthropogenic impact in these species. Detections of Callithrix were higher in areas with low forest strata. Our study provides baseline data for future fragmentation studies in Neotropical dry deciduous forests and sets a base for specific conservation measures.'

Abstract: "The raw materials of Iran's plywood industry are procured from the northern forests of Iran, and development of the plywood industry is intensively related to the situation of these forests. Previous research has indicated that the future development and location of plywood units in Iran will be highly dependent on the northern forests of Mazandaran & Gilan provinces, which have the second and fifth priorities among thirty provinces in this regard (Azizi, Memariani, 2004). Annual and per capita deforestation is a key factor in development planning, and the structure and operations of all sections of the wood industry, including plywood, needs to take account of this. In this research, we have estimated the number of plywood units required over an extended future period, taking into account annual deforestation, durability of the forests and per capita deforestation, using case study and exponential smoothing methods. The results have shown that the plywood industry will need to establish new plants, area of the forests will decrease by half, and per capita deforestation will increase in the coming decade."

Abstract: 'Changes in climatic characteristics such as seasonal and inter-annual variability may affect ecosystem structure and function, hence alter carbon and water budgets of ecosystems. Studies of modelling combined with field experiments can provide essential information to investigate interactions between carbon and water cycles and climate. Here we present a first attempt to investigate the long-term climate controls on seasonal patterns and inter-annual variations in water and carbon exchanges in an arid-zone savanna-woodland ecosystem using a detailed mechanistic soil\xe2\x80\x93plant\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere model (SPA), driven by leaf area index (LAI) simulated by an ecohydrological model (WAVES) and observed climate data during 1981\xe2\x80\x932012. The SPA was tested against almost 3\xc2\xa0years of eddy covariance flux measurements in terms of gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). The model was able to explain 80 and 71% of the variability of observed daily GPP and ET, respectively. Long-term simulations showed that carbon accumulation rates and ET ranged from 20.6\xc2\xa0g C m\xe2\x88\x922 mon\xe2\x88\x921 in the late dry season to 45.8\xc2\xa0g C m\xe2\x88\x922 mon\xe2\x88\x921 in the late wet season, respectively, primarily driven by seasonal variations in LAI and soil moisture. Large climate variations resulted in large seasonal variation in ecosystem water-use efficiency (eWUE). Simulated annual GPP varied between 146.4 and 604.7\xc2\xa0g C m\xe2\x88\x922 y\xe2\x88\x921. Variations in annual ET coincided with that of GPP, ranging from 110.2 to 625.8\xc2\xa0mm y\xe2\x88\x921. Annual variations in GPP and ET were driven by the annual variations in precipitation and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) but not temperature. The linear coupling of simulated annual GPP and ET resulted in eWUE having relatively small year-to-year variation.'

Abstract: 'Soil phosphorus (P) availability can be an important regulator of ecosystem processes. Changes in P availability over time have long been studied, but the P concentration of soil parent materials\xe2\x80\x94which determines ecosystem P concentration at the onset of soil formation\xe2\x80\x94have never been systematically explored. Here we ask two questions: 1) how does P concentration vary among soil parent materials? and 2) under what range of conditions do those differences influence soil P concentration?'

Abstract: 'The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) comprises extensive river and canal networks, both natural and man-made, and has a history of extensive land use change and development. The delta\xe2\x80\x99s wetlands are under considerable ecological stress because of hydrological changes, agricultural and aquaculture development, urban and industrial pollution, climate change, and upstream water resource development. In this paper, we review the current threats and challenges to the conservation and management of the wetlands in the VMD. We recommend that the current water management practices of the Ramsar-listed Lang Sen Wetland Reserve are changed so that the natural flood regimes are reinstated and the risks to the community from forest fires are managed. Ongoing investment is needed to support further research, set up long-term monitoring, and to develop hydrodynamic models for the Lang Sen Wetland Reserve so that management and conservation efforts can achieve the specific objectives for the wetland. This approach may be useful for managing other wetlands across the VMD.'

Abstract: 'The Rufous Gnateater, Conopophaga lineata, is a small insectivorous understory bird which is endemic to and widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic forest of South America. Its distribution makes it ideally suited for testing two major hypotheses for the origin of biodiversity, namely, the riverine barrier and the forest refuge hypotheses. In this study, we sequenced mitochondrial (control region) and nuclear markers (intron 5 of the \xce\xb2-fibrinogen gene) for individuals distributed in the southern Atlantic forest and obtained a strong genetic structure with one clear discontinuity in northern Brazilian state of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo. We consistently detected signals of demographic expansion for both markers, with estimates indicating that expansion started in the Late Pleistocene (250,000\xc2\xa0years ago), suggesting that the forest refuge hypothesis potentially explains Rufous Gnateater\xe2\x80\x99s diversification. We also found evidence of gene flow between populations from each side of this discontinuity, with a possible secondary contact zone occurring in the states of Minas Gerais, S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro.'

Abstract: "The relationship of global climate change to plant growth and the role of forests as sites of carbon sequestration have encouraged the refinement of the estimates of root biomass and production. However, tremendous controversy exists in the literature as to which is the best method to determine fine root biomass and production. This lack of consensus makes it difficult for researchers to determine which methods are most appropriate for their system. The sequential root coring method was the most commonly used method to collect root biomass data in the past and is still commonly used. But within the last decade the use of minirhizotrons has become a favorite method of many researchers. In addition, due to the high labor-intensive requirements of many of the direct approaches to determine root biomass, there has been a shift to develop indirect methods that would allow fine root biomass and production to be predicted using data on easily monitored variables that are highly correlated to root dynamics. Discussions occur as to which method should be used but without gathering data from the same site using different methods, these discussions can be futile. This paper discusses and compares the results of the most commonly used direct and indirect methods of determining root biomass and production: sequential root coring, ingrowth cores, minirhizotrons, carbon fluxes approach, nitrogen budget approach and correlations with abiotic resources. No consistent relationships were apparent when comparing several sites where at least one of the indirect and direct methods were used on the same site. Until the different root methods can be compared to some independently derived root biomass value obtained from total carbon budgets for systems, one root method cannot be stated to be the best and the method of choice will be determined from researcher's personal preference, experiences, equipment, and/or finances."

Abstract: 'The concept of ecosystem services has become important for our understanding of the role of nature for maintaining human livelihoods. But is biodiversity essential to maintain ecosystem services? Many studies suggest that higher biodiversity allows a higher level of ecosystem services, but others argue that there is little hard evidence, especially from tropical environments, to document the necessity of high biodiversity for provision of most ecosystem services. Thus, effective valuation of biodiversity for ecosystem services and long-term studies and monitoring are needed to fully understand the complex biodiversity-ecosystem service interface. This introduction briefly reviews some of the main arguments in this debate and provides an overview of the other five special issue papers. Exploring biodiversity and ecosystem interactions in the context of the provision of ecosystem services, these papers address population and biodiversity coexistence, the importance of dung beetles in agricultural landscapes, the knowledge and use of palms by local communities, bioprospecting for drugs and how biodiversity conservation may have added benefits in terms of improved watershed functions and health.'

Abstract: 'Mathematical models of transmission dynamics are routinely fitted to epidemiological time series, which must inevitably be aggregated at some spatial scale. Weekly case reports of chikungunya have been made available nationally for numerous countries in the Western Hemisphere since late 2013, and numerous models have made use of this data set for forecasting and inferential purposes. Motivated by an abundance of literature suggesting that the transmission of this mosquito-borne pathogen is localized at scales much finer than nationally, we fitted models at three different spatial scales to weekly case reports from Colombia to explore limitations of analyses of nationally aggregated time series data.'

Abstract: 'Even though \xe2\x80\x9csustainable development\xe2\x80\x9d seems to have emerged as the development paradigm of the 1990s, a great deal of vagueness still surrounds the meaning, definition, and theoretical underpinnings of the concept. There is also a general lack of emphasis on the spatial dimension of sustainable development when developing relevant conceptual or environmental accounting frameworks. In clarifying the concept, this article proposes a definition that explicitly incorporates the temporal as well as the spatial dimension of sustainability. It also develops a logically consistent conceptual framework for the analysis and evaluation of sustainable development, following a spatial systems approach. Five interconnected aspatial subsystems or subsets of a spatial system are identified and their respective operational dimensions discussed. A proposed composite index calleddegree of stainable development (DSD) and its five component indicators are also outlined. The difficulties involved in operationalizing the DSD measure and the conceptual framework are noted, and the various tasks that need to be undertaken in this regard are specified. It is concluded that future research utilizing the proposed conceptual framework should not only foster the development of appropriate methodologies for the comparative evaluation of sustainable development at global, national, or regional scales, but also offer insights to appropriate decision makers at various levels regarding available options and alternative actions for the healthy development of their respective societies.'

Abstract: 'Management may influence abiotic environments differently across time and spatial scale, greatly influencing perceptions of fragmentation of the landscape. It is vital to consider a priori the spatial scales that are most relevant to an investigation, and to reflect on the influence that scale may have on conclusions. While the importance of scale in understanding ecological patterns and processes has been widely recognized, few researchers have investigated how the relationships between pattern and process change across spatial and temporal scales. We used wavelet analysis to examine the multiscale structure of surface and soil temperature, measured every 5 m across a 3820 m transect within a national forest in northern Wisconsin. Temperature functioned as an indicator \xe2\x80\x93 or end product \xe2\x80\x93 of processes associated with energy budget dynamics, such as radiative inputs, evapotranspiration and convective losses across the landscape. We hoped to determine whether functional relationships between landscape structure and temperature could be generalized, by examining patterns and relationships at multiple spatial scales and time periods during the day. The pattern of temperature varied between surface and soil temperature and among daily time periods. Wavelet variances indicated that no single scale dominated the pattern in temperature at any time, though values were highest at finest scales and at midday. Using general linear models, we explained 38% to 60% of the variation in temperature along the transect. Broad categorical variables describing the vegetation patch in which a point was located and the closest vegetation patch of a different type (landscape context) were important in models of both surface and soil temperature across time periods. Variables associated with slope and microtopography were more commonly incorporated into models explaining variation in soil temperature, whereas variables associated with vegetation or ground cover explained more variation in surface temperature. We examined correlations between wavelet transforms of temperature and vegetation (i.e., structural) pattern to determine whether these associations occurred at predictable scales or were consistent across time. Correlations between transforms characteristically had two peaks; one at finer scales of 100 to 150 m and one at broader scales of >300 m. These scales differed among times of day and between surface and soil temperatures. Our results indicate that temperature structure is distinct from vegetation structure and is spatially and temporally dynamic. There did not appear to be any single scale at which it was more relevant to study temperature or this pattern-process relationship, although the strongest relationships between vegetation structure and temperature occurred within a predictable range of scales. Forest managers and conservation biologists must recognize the dynamic relationship between temperature and structure across landscapes and incorporate the landscape elements created by temperature-structure interactions into management decisions.'

Abstract: 'The mosquito Aedes (Ae). aegypti transmits the viruses that cause dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. We investigate how choosing alternate emissions and/or socioeconomic pathways may modulate future human exposure to Ae. aegypti. Occurrence patterns for Ae. aegypti for 2061\xe2\x80\x932080 are mapped globally using empirically downscaled air temperature and precipitation projections from the Community Earth System Model, for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Population growth is quantified using gridded global population projections consistent with two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), SSP3 and SSP5. Change scenarios are compared to a 1950\xe2\x80\x932000 reference period. A global land area of 56.9\xc2\xa0M\xc2\xa0km2 is climatically suitable for Ae. aegypti during the reference period, and is projected to increase by 8\xc2\xa0% (RCP4.5) to 13\xc2\xa0% (RCP8.5) by 2061\xe2\x80\x932080. The annual average number of people exposed globally to Ae. aegypti for the reference period is 3794\xc2\xa0M, a value projected to statistically significantly increase by 298\xe2\x80\x93460\xc2\xa0M (8\xe2\x80\x9312\xc2\xa0%) by 2061\xe2\x80\x932080 if only climate change is considered, and by 4805\xe2\x80\x935084\xc2\xa0M (127\xe2\x80\x93134\xc2\xa0%) for SSP3 and 2232\xe2\x80\x932483\xc2\xa0M (59\xe2\x80\x9365\xc2\xa0%) for SSP5 considering both climate and population change (lower and upper values of each range represent RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively). Thus, taking the lower-emissions RCP4.5 pathway instead of RCP8.5 may mitigate future human exposure to Ae. aegypti globally, but the effect of population growth on exposure will likely be larger. Regionally, Australia, Europe and North America are projected to have the largest percentage increases in human exposure to Ae. aegypti considering only climate change.'

Abstract: 'Genetic diversity represents the heritable variation both within and among populations of organisms, and in the context of this paper, among bamboo species. Bamboo is an economically important member of the grass family Poaceae, under the subfamily Bambusoideae. India has the second largest bamboo reserve in Asia after China. It is commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9cpoor man\xe2\x80\x99s timber\xe2\x80\x9d, keeping in mind the variety of its end use from cradle to coffin. There is a wide genetic diversity of bamboo around the globe and this pool of genetic variation serves as the base for selection as well as for plant improvement. Thus, the identification, characterization and documentation of genetic diversity of bamboo are essential for this purpose. During recent years, multiple endeavors have been undertaken for characterization of bamboo species with the aid of molecular markers for sustainable utilization of genetic diversity, its conservation and future studies. Genetic diversity assessments among the identified bamboo species, carried out based on the DNA fingerprinting profiles, either independently or in combination with morphological traits by several researchers, are documented in the present review. This review will pave the way to prepare the database of prevalent bamboo species based on their molecular characterization.'

Abstract: 'Soil compaction, a process that decreases the free space among soil particles and hinders the underground movement of soil organisms, is one of the increasing impacts of mankind on the world\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystems. We investigated the responses of subterranean ants to soil compaction by testing the following predictions: (i) soil from a trail is more compressed, leading to (ii) a decrease in species richness and a selective shift in ant assemblage composition, which is made up by (iii) species with a smaller body size that can apply a greater relative strength to move through soil particles. We carried out this study in and outside of a recreational ecology trail in a forest fragment in Vi\xc3\xa7osa, MG, Southeastern Brazil. The compaction was higher in the soil from the trail than outside of it. No change was observed in species richness, but soil compaction promoted a shift in ant assemblage composition, with ant size decreasing with an increase in soil compaction. However, ants did not appear to apply a greater strength to soil particles for moving in habitats with a high soil compaction. Overall, organisms at superficial soil layers appeared to be sensitive to even moderate human impacts that promote a filtering of the ant assemblage species composition, with small body size being a required trait.'

Abstract: 'The study of animal sound signals can be useful in assisting conservation strategies. Understanding the vocal repertoires of endangered species and the behavioral contexts in which they are given is relevant for monitoring protocols, such as those based on automated sound recordings. The pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor) is at risk of extinction because of deforestation and urban growth in its restricted geographic range. Between 2012 and 2015 we studied the vocal repertoire of the species and the contexts in which different signals are emitted. We made focal recordings of eight free-living groups, two rescued individuals, and one temporarily captive group of pied tamarins in Manaus, central Brazilian Amazonia. From the 766 sounds analyzed we identified 12 distinct signals within the range of 2\xe2\x80\x9311\xc2\xa0kHz. Most signals were emitted during resting or locomotion. Less frequently emitted signals were associated with intergroup agonistic interactions, foraging, and infant-exclusive vocalizations. These results increased the known vocal repertoire of the pied tamarin providing more reliable baseline data for monitoring the species by means of automated or focal sound recordings.'

Abstract: 'Among many indigenous peoples of Amazonia, shamanism and Christianity co-exist as central cultural elements shaping the ways in which people interpret and interact with the world. Despite centuries of co-existence, the relationship between shamanism and Christianity has entered an especially dynamic era as many of Amazonia\xe2\x80\x99s indigenous peoples abandon Catholicism for Evangelical and Sabbatarian churches. Testing the relationship between Christian church affiliation and shamanism in 23 Makushi and Wapishana communities in southern Guyana, we found that Evangelicals and Sabbatarians are less likely to visit shamans or accept their legitimacy than are Anglicans and Catholics. However, conversion does not necessarily imply a complete rejection of indigenous religious systems as many self-identified Evangelicals and Sabbatarians continue to adhere to some indigenous beliefs and practices. We conclude by positing possible implications of religious conversion for natural resource use on indigenous lands.'

Abstract: 'This study details the development and validation of a measure of mindful self-care, the Mindful Self-Care Scale (MSCS). Based on theory and emerging empirical work, the MSCS items were developed to align with a set of actionable practices that promote positive embodiment and well-being. The extant literature on self-care was reviewed and a set of items developed. Following expert review, the retained items were factor analyzed (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0448, aged 18\xe2\x80\x9371, 79.7% female, 90.0% Caucasian) resulting in six factors: physical care, supportive relationships, mindful awareness, self-compassion and purpose, mindful relaxation, and supportive structure. Overall, the MSCS was significantly and positively correlated with body esteem and negatively correlated with eating disorder risk. Confirmatory factor analyses were applied to a second independent sample (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0452, aged 18\xe2\x80\x9378, 69.7% female, 70.8% Caucasian) providing cross-validation of the six-dimensional structure of the MSCS. Internal consistency was upheld for the total scale and subscales. Findings and implications for future research follow along with a review of the limitations of this study.'

Abstract: 'Institutional theory implies that normative societal expectations create pressures for organizations to respond acceptably to important institutional constituents. Although the role of the institutional environment on marketing has been studied, the organizational mechanisms by which firms respond to societal pressures remain under-investigated. We suggest that an important determining factor involves organizational identity, which drives firm response to societal norms and facilitates its quest for legitimacy. Accordingly, this study contributes to organizational theory in marketing by casting identity as the focal mechanism in the firm\xe2\x80\x99s response to the institutional environment. Marketing ethics and CSR issues frame this research given natural synergies with institutional and organizational identity theories and evidence that increasingly, firms must respond to societal expectations involving ethics in their marketing practices. Using game theoretical models and economic experiments, we find that the influence of the institutional environment emerges through firm identity, affecting resource allocation to ethical product augmentation.'

Abstract: 'This study examined the inclusion of nature of science (NOS) in popular science writing to determine whether it could serve supplementary resource for teaching NOS and to evaluate the accuracy of text mining and classification as a viable research tool in science education research. Four groups of documents published from 2001 to 2010 were analyzed: Scientific American, Discover magazine, winners of the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books, and books from NSTA\xe2\x80\x99s list of Outstanding Science Trade Books. Computer analysis categorized passages in the selected documents based on their inclusions of NOS. Human analysis assessed the frequency, context, coverage, and accuracy of the inclusions of NOS within computer identified NOS passages. NOS was rarely addressed in selected document sets but somewhat more frequently addressed in the letters section of the two magazines. This result suggests that readers seem interested in the discussion of NOS-related themes. In the popular science books analyzed, NOS presentations were found more likely to be aggregated in the beginning and the end of the book, rather than scattered throughout. The most commonly addressed NOS elements in the analyzed documents are science and society and empiricism in science. Only one inaccurate presentation of NOS were identified in all analyzed documents. The text mining technique demonstrated exciting performance, which invites more applications of the technique to analyze other aspects of science textbooks, popular science writing, or other materials involved in science teaching and learning.'

Abstract: 'Forested tropical landscapes around the world are being extensively logged and converted to agriculture, with serious consequences for biodiversity and potentially ecosystem functioning. Here we investigate associations between habitat disturbance and functional diversity of ants and termites\xe2\x80\x94two numerically dominant and functionally important taxa in tropical rain forests that perform key roles in predation, decomposition, nutrient cycling and seed dispersal. We compared ant and termite occurrence and composition within standardised volumes of soil and dead wood in old growth forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Termites occurred substantially less frequently in converted habitats than in old growth forest, whereas ant occurrences were highest in logged forest and lowest in old growth forest. All termite feeding groups had low occurrence in disturbed habitats, with soil feeders occurring even less frequently than wood feeders. Ant functional groups showed more variable associations, with some opportunist and behaviourally dominant groups being more abundant in degraded habitats. The importance of ants and termites in tropical ecosystems and such differing patterns of assemblage variation suggest that ecosystem functioning may be significantly altered in converted habitats.'

Abstract: 'Reliable soil organic carbon (SOC) stock measurements of all major ecosystems are essential for predicting the influence of global warming on global soil carbon pools, but hardly any detailed soil survey data are available for tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) and adjacent high elevation grasslands above (puna). TMCF are among the most threatened of ecosystems under current predicted global warming scenarios. We conducted an intensive soil sampling campaign extending 40\xc2\xa0km along the tree line in the Peruvian Andes between 2994 and 3860\xc2\xa0m asl to quantify SOC stocks of TMCF, puna grassland, and shrubland sites in the transition zone between the two habitats. SOC stocks from the soil surface down to the bedrock averaged (\xc2\xb1standard error SE) 11.8 (\xc2\xb11.5, N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa024) kg\xc2\xa0C/m2 in TMCF, 14.7 (\xc2\xb11.4, N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09) kg\xc2\xa0C/m2 in the shrublands and 11.9 (\xc2\xb10.8, N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa035) kg\xc2\xa0C/m2 in the grasslands and were not significantly different (P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05 for all comparisons). However, soil profile analysis revealed distinct differences, with TMCF profiles showing a uniform SOC distribution with depth, shrublands a linear decrease, and puna sites an exponential decrease in SOC densities with soil depth. Organic soil layer thickness reached a maximum (~70\xc2\xa0cm) at the upper limit of the TMCF and declined with increasing altitude toward puna sites. Within TMCF, no significant increase in SOC stocks with increasing altitude was observed, probably because of the large variations among SOC stocks at different sites, which in turn were correlated with spatial variation in soil depth.'

Abstract: 'Cities are highly modified environments in which the only areas that resemble natural landscapes are urban parks with low human population density. Attempts are frequently made to maintain high bird diversity in cities for aesthetic or educational reasons. However, it remains unclear whether local site characteristics are important in determining bird assemblage composition or whether simplification of the assemblage is an inevitable consequence of the changes associated with human population density. From May 1998 to December 1999, we undertook bird counts at 521 points in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Our main goal was to understand the pattern of distribution of the bird species richness and density within the city and determine which variables most affect species assemblages. We recorded 132 species belonging to 43 families that are common in Rio Grande do Sul and obtained quantitative data on 121 species in survey sites. The two most abundant species (House Sparrow, Passer domesticus and Rock dove, Columba livia) were exotics. Analysis based on a reduced subset of 134 points surveyed in spring/early summer suggested that there was a North\xe2\x80\x93south gradient in assemblage structure. Variation in assemblage structure was also affected by the number of trees, urban noise and human population density. However, human population density had a much smaller effect on richness and assemblage structure than variables subject to management, such as tree density and noise levels. These results suggest that complex communities may be maintained in densely populated urban areas of sub-tropical South-America given adequate urban planning.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents a comparative discussion of the application of principles of international environmental law in the Latin American region and the European Union. The question we seek to answer is how (international) environmental principles are employed by Supreme Courts in Latin America, with a brief comparison with the approach by the European Court of Justice. This research presents an illustrative sample of Court of Justice cases and Supreme Court cases in Latin American countries to create an overview of different principles and approaches in practice. We construct a database and an illustrative sample of cases related to the environment since the Rio Declaration of 1992. This sample shows a wide range of principles of and approaches to environmental law in Latin America. Preliminary findings point to strong harmonization in the application of the principle of public participation and participation of indigenous groups in development projects. However, other principles, such as participation by women, are not widely disseminated or regularly deployed in arguments in court or in rulings. Others international environmental principles such as the precautionary principle, the polluter pays principle and the principle of sustainable development are also part of our analysis. This paper concludes that the application of environmental law principles in the regions needs to be integrated and strengthened.'

Abstract: 'Robotic systems for outdoor applications can play an important role in the future. Tasks like exploration, surveillance or search and rescue missions benefit greatly from increased autonomy of the available systems. Outdoor environments and their high complexity pose a special challenge for existing autonomous behaviour technologies in robots. Some of these challenges in the area of navigation, plan management and sensor integration are investigated in the Intelligent Mobility (iMoby) project at the DFKI. An introduction to the project goals and the current achievements is given. Further, an outlook towards the end of the project and beyond is provided.'
