Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Native coffee AFS and forests have comparable carbon (C) stocks and tree diversity.\xe2\x80\xa2Introducing exotic shade trees in AFS negatively affects C stocks and tree diversity.\xe2\x80\xa2Conversion from Arabica to Robusta coffee AFS system affects C storage.\xe2\x80\xa2C storage and tree diversity positively covary in the agroforests of the study area.AbstractThe ongoing introduction of the exotic Grevillea robusta tree species into agroforestry systems (AFS) of the Indian Western Ghats could become a threat to both climate change mitigation and tree diversity conservation.Here, we quantified carbon (C) storage and shade tree diversity in native forests and coffee AFS under contrasted management (native versus exotic shade trees, Robusta versus Arabica systems) at 67 plots along a 3500\xe2\x80\xafmm precipitation gradient in the Cauvery watershed, India.Despite a substantial reduction of shade tree cover in native AFS compared to forest (from 90% to 32% in the high precipitation area), native AFS and forests displayed high and comparable C stocks (max. 228 MgC ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 234 MgC ha-1, respectively) and tree diversity (max. 44 and 45 species, respectively). Both variables were negatively impacted by the introduction of G. robusta, especially in Robusta coffee systems (max. 158 MgC ha\xe2\x88\x921, 12 species).The current trend toward the introduction of G. robusta in coffee AFS of the study area (exotic agroforestry) negatively affects C storage and tree diversity, especially in Robusta coffee systems. Policy makers should take advantage of the carbon-tree diversity positive correlation found in the agroforestry landscape of the Western Ghats of India to promote conservation and climate change mitigation.'

Large scale land use land cover (LULC) change leading to deforestation is one of the drivers of global climate changes and alteration of biogeochemical cycles with significant consequences in ecosystem services and biodiversity. This has necessitated the investigation of LULC by mapping, monitoring and modelling spatio-temporal patterns and evaluating these in the context of human-environment interactions. The current work investigates LULC changes with temperature dynamics of select protected areas in Western Ghats. The land use analyses reveal changes in the forest cover across Kudremukh National Park (KNP), Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (RTR), Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR). KNP region has lost evergreen forest cover during 1973\xe2\x80\x932016 from 33.46 to 27.22%, while BTR lost deciduous cover from 61.69 to 47.3% due to mining, horticulture plantations, human habitations, etc. The LST increase has impacted regeneration of species with the induced water stress, etc. CA-Markov modelling was used for forecasting the likely land uses in 2026 and validation was done through Kappa indices. Results highlight decline of evergreen cover in KNP (9%) and deciduous cover in RTR (2%) followed by BTR (3%) with further expansion of plantations, which will impact biodiversity, hydrology and ecology. Insights of LULC dynamics help natural resource managers in evolving appropriate strategies to ensure conservation of threatened biota in Western Ghats.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (494KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractWildlife utilization in the tropics is massive, with nearly 5 million tons of bushmeat consumed by local communities. In India, a megadiversity nation, hunting\xe2\x80\x94although illegal\xe2\x80\x94is widespread among indigenous communities. However, the extent, frequency, and rationale for hunting, and factors influencing wildlife utilization are poorly known. Our study, based on 19 different indigenous communities in the Western Ghats region, revealed the utilization of 54 wild species/taxa. Although freshwater fish, herpetofauna, and small mammals were most frequently utilized, enforcement by the Forest Department was largely focused on large mammals. Gender, land ownership, number of domestic meats consumed, distance to markets, time spent hunting, and distance to hunting areas were major factors that affected wild meat utilization in the region. Although conservation needs to be focused on the most utilized groups, increasing access to domestic meats at remote settlements and integrating utilization of common, culturally prominent species can improve conservation of threatened fauna.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Tribal people in the south Indian area of Attappady have become progressively marginalised over the past decades.\xe2\x80\xa2Planned adaptation is important for coping but did not succeed in creating capacities that incentivise autonomous adaptation.\xe2\x80\xa2Prevalent adaptation strategies are ill-attuned to the complex socio-ecological and cultural matrix of Attappady.\xe2\x80\xa2Root causes of vulnerability remain persistent, posing challenges for future adaptation trajectories.AbstractClimate change adaptation has become an important aspect of research and policy agendas at different scales \xe2\x80\x93 globally, nationally and locally. One stream of thought relates to the thematic area of barriers or challenges that adaptation faces. This article explores local adaptation trajectories and challenges in a tribal development block in south India. Through the lens of key livelihood strategies pursued in the block \xe2\x80\x93 namely income from development interventions, migration and on-farm strategies \xe2\x80\x93 it explores the challenges and factors that contribute or have contributed, to impeding successful adaptation outcomes in Attappady. The article argues that development interventions (i.e planned adaptations) have not succeeded in addressing structural causes of vulnerability; they have, however, provided an important coping mechanism. Migration is a socially and culturally differentiated phenomenon and is not a viable diversification option for the most vulnerable population segments in Attappady. Finally, it is found that recent on-farm adaptation strategies present a case of maladaptation that promote marginalisation and are ill-suited to the local ecological and cultural landscape.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Sacred forest groves are protected historically through cultural practices.\xe2\x80\xa2We show that some sacred groves are regenerated patches of forest.\xe2\x80\xa2The social\xe2\x80\x93ecological system of sacred forest groves changes over time.\xe2\x80\xa2Various cultural, social, political and ecological drivers are identified.\xe2\x80\xa2We provide insights for modern-day forest restoration and management.AbstractSacred forest groves in the Western Ghats of India are small fragments of tropical forest that have received protection due to religious beliefs and cultural practices. These forest fragments are an example of community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400\xc2\xa0years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches? How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s (1956) framework of \xe2\x80\x98cultural revitalization\xe2\x80\x99 and based on historical literature and palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India. It suggests various social, ecological and economic drivers of such revitalization, recognizing strong linkages between the \xe2\x80\x98social\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98ecological\xe2\x80\x99 within the social\xe2\x80\x93ecological system of sacred forest groves. This example of reforestation suggests that contemporary restoration of forests needs to operate at a landscape scale and look at restoration as a social\xe2\x80\x93ecological intervention in forest management.'

Title: 'Sustaining biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes in the Western Ghats: Remnant forests matter'
Author: 'M.O.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000145
Abstract: 'AbstractHuman-modified tropical landscapes under semi-natural or agro-ecosystems often harbor biodiversity of significant conservation value. In the Western Ghats of India, these ecosystems also provide connectivity between protected areas and other remnant forests. We investigated the conservation value of these landscapes and agro-ecosystems using results from 35 studies covering 14 taxonomic groups. Large, conspicuous taxonomic groups and tree-covered land-use types have received much focus in this area of research in the Western Ghats. We computed a response ratio defined as the log ratio of species richness in human land use to species richness in forest control site from 17 studies. In a meta-analysis, we investigated variation of this ratio across studies with respect to three variables: taxonomic group, the land-use type sampled and the extent of forest cover within the study landscape. Higher forest cover within the landscape emerged as a major positive influence on biodiversity in human-modified landscapes for vertebrates and vegetation while no patterns emerged for invertebrates. Our results suggest that loss of remnant forest patches from these landscapes is likely to reduce biodiversity within agro-ecosystems and exacerbate overall biodiversity loss across the Western Ghats. Conservation of these remnant forest patches through protection and restoration of habitat and connectivity to larger forest patches needs to be prioritized. In the densely populated Western Ghats, this can only be achieved by building partnerships with local land owners and stakeholders through innovative land-use policy and incentive schemes for conservation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe negative impact of anthropogenic activity on tropical forests is well documented, but the underlying factors, including socioeconomic conditions, government policy, and agricultural practices, that influence forest degradation in developing countries are poorly understood. For centuries, Soppinabetta forests (SBFs) in the Western Ghats of India have provided essential habitat for wildlife and vital organic resources (leaf litter, green foliage) for the cultivation of betel nut palms (Areca catechu) and rice paddy (Oryza sativa). Historically, betel nut farmers carefully managed resource extraction in SBFs, but recent changes in land use policy allow for unmitigated resource extraction by site dwellers, which may imperil the traditional sustainable management of SBFs. Site dwellers live on government allotted sites and primarily derive their income through the sale of forest-based products. We used SBFs as a model system to investigate the factors governing: (i) forest resource extraction, (ii) the effect of changing agricultural practices on the rate of resource extraction, and (iii) farmers\xe2\x80\x99 perception of SBFs conservation in response to changes in governmental land use policy. Results from surveys of 90 households (57 farmers and 33 site-dwellers) and the forest department indicate individual farmers collected an average of 31.09 (range 0\xe2\x80\x93125)\xc2\xa0metric\xc2\xa0tons of leaf litter and 19.11\xc2\xa0metric\xc2\xa0tons (range 0\xe2\x80\x93120) of green foliage per year. Organic resource harvesting by farmers was positively correlated with the size of betel nut plantations, size of SBFs, and number of livestock owned per household. Betel nut plantations require six times more compost than food grains cultivated in field paddies. In past one decade, 33% of field paddies have been converted into betel nut plantations, increasing the strain on SBFs for forest resources. Farmers believe that when they lose provisional ownership of SBFs, site dwellers unsustainably harvest resources and severely damage SBFs. We suggest that an inclusive, local-level, farmer-driven protection be implemented to preserve the SBF heritage system of Western Ghats.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba Soppinabetta forests are farmer-managed wet evergreen forests of Sringeri in the Western Ghats. \xe2\x96\xba These forests are allotted proportionately to the betel nut plantation area of a farmer. \xe2\x96\xba Farmers collect leaf litter and green foliages from these forests to manure agricultural lands. \xe2\x96\xba Recent land use policy alienates the local control of farmers over Soppinabetta forests. \xe2\x96\xba This policy leads to unsustainable harvest of resources by landless poor peoples, competition for forest resources and degradation of the forest. \xe2\x96\xba Inclusive local-level and farmer driven protection system is required to preserve Soppinabetta forests.'

Title: 'Mottled motivations and narrow incentives: Exploring limitations of direct incentive policies in the Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Arshiya'

Abstract: 'AbstractMarket-based instruments (MBIs) have proliferated to address environmental degradation outside Protected Areas (PAs). Coffee plantations have been one of the most active spaces for MBIs through third-party certifications. In the certification context, the logic of extrinsic motivators is explicitly used to incentivise coffee growers in the short-term to adopt environmentally sustainable and socially responsible production, including maintaining native tree species on plantations. Coffee growers that qualify with the environmental and social standards are audited, certified and eligible to the incentive. However, there is little empirical evidence on what encourages people to adopt and maintain an ecologically compatible lifestyle. This paper attempts to question the assumption regarding the importance of extrinsic catalysts as a motivation for changes in land management strategies. We test this hypothesis in the Indian context, where the history of direct payments for conservation has been very limited. Our work finally ask the question: have conservation programmes that use direct payments ignored intrinsic motivations in their programme design? The empirical findings presented in this paper contribute to a better understanding of the range of psychological, behavioral and social factors that drive these land-use and land management decisions and explicitly engage with debates on crowding-in and crowding-out in conservation.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2A farmer plants 237 trees yr\xe2\x88\x921 on average, of which 78% are Grevillea robusta trees.\xe2\x80\xa2Native species received more multipurpose utility citations than exotic species.\xe2\x80\xa2Economic value received from native timber was 12% of that from exotic G. robusta.\xe2\x80\xa2Dry climate, large farms and improved tenure security promoted more tree planting.\xe2\x80\xa2Improved ownership and economic value for native trees will increase their planting.AbstractFarmers worldwide regularly plant trees to obtain provisioning and other ecosystem services. This practice has come under scrutiny by conservationists who perceive a reduction of biodiversity due to preferential planting of exotic trees. In order to reverse this preference for exotic trees it is necessary to identify the key drivers of exotic species planting and propose alternative species of interest to farmers. We examined this question in a coffee agroforestry landscape of the Western Ghats, India, a global biodiversity hotspot. We interviewed farmers regarding tree planting behaviour, preferences and constraints, and assessed the relative performance and value of native versus exotic species. Multivariate analyses were used with six species-level characteristics and four farm-level characteristics, to reveal the most significant predictors of planting frequency.The exotic species Grevillea robusta was planted 5.4 times more often than native trees. Individual species\xe2\x80\x99 planting frequencies were most strongly related to their realised economic values, which was highest for G. robusta. Native trees with greater multipurpose utility value and stature were also more likely to be planted. Farm-level characteristics related to increased planting efforts were increasing climatic dryness, increased land area with native tree tenurial rights and farm size. However, farmers with a greater proportion of land under secure tree tenure planted fewer trees.We conclude that although native trees had higher multipurpose utility and potential economic value than the exotic G. robusta, the latter is grown more often due to existing legal frameworks that restrict private ownership and realising monetary value from native species. If current laws were amended to increase the economic benefits obtained from native trees, they are likely to be planted more often by farmers. We propose that our results can help in implementation of the recent National Agroforestry Policy of India, as well as inform agroforestry policies and practice elsewhere.'

Abstract: 'AbstractInvasions by exotic plants threaten the biodiversity and integrity of Protected Areas (PAs) by manipulating the species composition, the nutrient cycling and the hydrology prevailing in the specific habitat. Invasion of plant species in the natural ecosystem especially in the precincts of Western Ghats is due to rampant anthropogenic pressures. Complete assessment of the vegetation, richness distribution of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and their association with the environmental drivers is essential to manage the PAs effectively. The present study analyses the richness of native vegetation with a comparative view on the distribution of Lantana camara, Chromolena odorata and Pteridium aquilinum in proposed Palani Hill National Park (PHNP), Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. Secondly prepare models of the distribution of the target invasive species in the region. The biotic and abiotic data along with the vegetation type were generated and overlaid on IAS distribution to model the spread of target plant species. The study revealed that the distribution of invasive species negative relationship between the native species richness and positive relationship between the species dominance. Among the forest types dry evergreen, moist deciduous and tree savanna were found to be more vulnerable to invasion of Lantana camara and Chromolena odorata, wherein tree savanna and plantation were more vulnerable to invasion of Pteridium aquilinum. The information will strongly support effective management of Protected Areas.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We assessed status of community-managed sacred groves (SG) in the Western Ghats.\xe2\x80\xa2Current extent and recent trends in forest cover and biomass were examined.\xe2\x80\xa2SG network smaller than officially reported, with biomass declines in recent years.\xe2\x80\xa2Local communities perceived encroachment and logging as threats to SG.\xe2\x80\xa2Dynamism in conservation status of SG highlights need for rigorous monitoring.AbstractAlthough the potential for community-conserved areas (CCAs) to extend conservation beyond formal protected areas is widely acknowledged, the scarcity of conservation assessments and monitoring hinders the rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness in many regions. In India, which hosts a high density and diversity of CCAs, the need for more assessments of the ecological and socio-economic properties of these systems to guide conservation planning and policy has been emphasised in recent years. We inventoried the extant sacred grove network against official records of 407 groves across 70 villages in the Kodagu District of India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats, and interviewed local communities about their management and conservation. We also evaluated recent trends in aboveground biomass of sacred groves using time-series satellite data from six time-points during the 2000\xe2\x80\x932010 period, and made comparisons to corresponding trends in nearby State-managed protected forests. Although most of the larger (>2\xc2\xa0ha) groves officially listed were forested at present, over two-thirds of the smaller groves listed were either not forested or could not be located. Local communities attributed these declines to encroachment and illicit logging. Time-series satellite data revealed aboveground biomass declines of \xe2\x88\xbc0.5% annually across the sacred grove network over the 2000\xe2\x80\x932010 period. In contrast, biomass increased during this period at the interiors and edges of State-managed forests in the landscape. Our results highlight that the conservation status of even well-protected CCAs can vary considerably over time, especially given the dynamism in socio-economic, cultural and ecological factors that govern their status. We argue that understanding and addressing this dynamism is crucial to the conservation of CCAs.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMaintaining forest cover is important for Biodiversity Hotspots that support many endangered and endemic species but have lost much of their original forest extent. In developing countries, ongoing economic and demographic growth within Hotspots can alter rates and patterns of deforestation, making it a concern to quantify rates of forest loss and assess landscape-scale correlates of deforestation within Hotspots. Such analyses can help set baselines for future monitoring and provide landscape-scale perspectives to design conservation policy. For the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot in India, we examined correlates of forest loss following rapid economic expansion (post-2000\xe2\x80\xafCE). First, we used open-source remote-sensing data to estimate annual trends in recent forest loss (from 2000 to 2016) for the entire Hotspot. Across the entire Western Ghats, we assessed the relative importance of and interactions among demographic, administrative, and biophysical factors that predicted rates of forest loss\xe2\x80\x94measured as the number of 30\xe2\x80\xaf\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\xaf30-m\xe2\x80\xafpixels of forest lost within randomly selected 1\xe2\x80\xafkm2 cells. Protected areas reduced forest loss by 30%, especially when forests were closer to roads (33%) and towns (36%). However, the advantage of protection declined by 32% when local population densities increased, implying that the difference in forest loss between protected and non-protected areas disappears at high local population densities. To check scale-dependency of spatial extent, we repeated the modelling process for two landscape subsets within Western Ghats. In contrast with results for the entire Western Ghats, both focal landscapes showed no difference in deforestation with protection status alone or its interactions with village population density and distance to towns. However, deforestation was 88% lower when forests were protected and farther from roads. Overall, our results indicate that protected areas help retain forest cover within a global Biodiversity Hotspot even with rapid development, but high human population densities and road development can reduce the benefits of protection.'

We surveyed 1972 households from 1371 villages in a 7449-km2 area surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats. Our observational study modeled self-reported crop and livestock loss and compensation access by households. Crop loss was reported by 64% of households and associated with growing cotton, sugarcane, coffee and rice. Livestock loss was reported by 15% of households, and associated with grazing animals inside reserves. Losses incurred by households varied across reserves, averaging INR Rs 23,010 for crop loss and Rs 5423 for livestock loss. Compensation receipt was reported by 31% of households, and associated with reporting loss to authorities and elephant related incidents. Overall, landscape estimated probability of crop loss was 0.91, livestock loss was 0.19 and compensation was 0.29. Common mitigation measures for crop protection were night watching (46%), fencing (34%) and scare devices (34%); and for livestock protection were closer watch on animals (7%), guard animals (3%) and fencing (2%). Among 13 reported mitigation measures, no individual measure appeared to be associated with lowering crop or livestock loss. Unexpectedly, reported losses were similar across all reserves with higher losses incurred by households closer to the reserves. We identified conflict hot spots and influential factors across five reserves to improve current management efforts directed at conflict prevention and mitigation, and this approach is extendable to other human-dominated wildlife rich landscapes.'

Title: 'The rain\xe2\x80\x93runoff response of tropical humid forest ecosystems to use and reforestation in the Western Ghats of India'
Author: 'Jagdish'

Abstract: 'SummaryThe effects of forest degradation and use and establishment of tree-plantations on degraded or modified forest ecosystems at multi-decadal time-scales using tree-plantations on the streamflow response are less studied in the humid tropics when compared to deforestation and forest conversion to agriculture. In the Western Ghats of India (Uttar Kannada, Karnataka State), a previous soil hydraulic conductivity survey linked with rain IDF (intensity\xe2\x80\x93duration\xe2\x80\x93frequency) had suggested a greater occurrence of infiltration-excess overland within the degraded forest and reforested areas and thus potentially higher streamflow (Bonell et al., 2010). We further tested these predictions in Uttar Kannada by establishing experimental basins ranging from 7 to 23\xc2\xa0ha across three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen Forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest (DF) and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. In total, 11 basins were instrumented (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF) in two geomorphological zones, i.e., Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad) and at three sites (one Coastal, two Up-Ghat). The rainfall\xe2\x80\x93streamflow observations collected (at daily and also at a 36\xc2\xa0min time resolutions in the Coastal basins) over a 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0year period (2003\xe2\x80\x932005) were analysed.In both the Coastal and Up-Ghat basins, the double mass curves showed during the rainy season a consistent trend in favour of more proportion of streamflow in the rank order DF\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0AC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0NF. These double mass curves provide strong evidence that overland flow is progressively becomes a more dominant stormflow pathway. Across all sites, NF converted 28.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa06.41stdev% of rainfall into total streamflow in comparison to 32.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa06.97stdev% in AC and 45.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa09.61stdev% in DF.Further support for the above trends emerges from the quickflow ratio QF/Q for the Coastal basins. There are much higher values for both the DF and AC land covers, and their rank order DF\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0AC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0NF. The quickflow response ratio QF/P is also the highest for the DF basin, and along with the QF/Q ratio, can exceed 90%. The corresponding delayed flow response ratios, QD/P clearly show the largest QD yields as a proportion of event precipitation from the Forest (NF1). The application of linear model supported these differences (e.g. 10\xe2\x80\x9336% difference between NF and DF, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) in the storm hydrologic response of the Coastal basins. The exception was QF/P where there was a higher uncertainty connected with inter-basin mean differences. Cross-correlation plots for rain\xe2\x80\x93streamflow and corresponding lag regression models for three storm events in the Coastal basins suggested the existence of alternative stormflow pathways with multiple lags with peaks between \xe2\x88\xbc12 and 24\xc2\xa0h in NF, compared to respective bimodal peaks at \xe2\x88\xbc1 and 16\xc2\xa0h in AC and \xe2\x88\xbc1 and 12\xc2\xa0h in DF. The long time lags for NF are suggestive of deep subsurface stormflow and groundwater as the contributing sources to the storm hydrograph. The short time lags in DF and AC are indicative of overland flow and so \xe2\x80\x98memory\xe2\x80\x99 of the previous degraded land cover is retained in AC as supported by previous hydraulic conductivity data. As potential and actual evapotranspiration is likely to be depressed during the monsoon, differences in streamflow and run-off responses between land-cover types is largely attributed to differences in soil infiltration and hydrologic pathways. Enhancing infiltration and reducing run-off in managed ecosystems should be explored in the terms of the context of other ecosystem services and biodiversity.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Unique data on hydrologic effects of tropical reforestation and human-use. \xe2\x96\xba Clear evidence for the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration trade-off hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x96\xba Comprehensive paper on hydrology of Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot. \xe2\x96\xba Hydrologic processes across land-cover analysed using multiple approaches.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa240% reduction in overall forest cover during the last 95 years.\xe2\x80\xa2Agricultural land is often converting into Scrubland.\xe2\x80\xa2Currently mining and urbanization are the key factors of forest and LUCC.\xe2\x80\xa2The habitats of group of rare, endangered and threatened and endemic species either reduced or degraded due to anthropogenic pressure.\xe2\x80\xa2The habitat of RET and endemic species fragmented alarmingly.AbstractNatural resources are experiencing unprecedented pressures due to land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Such changes in LULC have significantly affected the extent and condition of forests in the Eastern Ghats of India causing a decline in the forest cover as well as disturbing the habitats of several rare, endangered, threatened (RET) and endemic species. The current study attempts to determine the habitat suitability and threat of a selected group of plants viz, RET and endemic species. This is realized in light of LULC change and forest fragmentation over a period of \xe2\x88\xbc100 years to understand the possible conservation strategies in the study area. Historical maps and satellite images from 1920 to 2015 were used to develop the LULC and fragmentation maps. MaxEnt species distribution model were used to simulate the distribution of RET and endemic species. Our study reveals that, by and large, the Eastern Ghats have lost 15.83% of its forest area over a span of \xe2\x88\xbc100 years. For the study period from 1920 to 2015, it is estimated that about 7.92% of forest area was converted into agriculture, and up to 3.80% into scrub/grassland respectively. Also, it was found that the total number of forest patches have been increased from 1509 in 1920\xe2\x80\x939457 in 2015, core area has declined from 93461.05\xc2\xa0sq.km in 1920\xe2\x80\x9361262.11\xc2\xa0sq.km in 2015, and edge length has increased to 2.20\xc2\xa0sq.km in 2015 as compared to 0.82\xc2\xa0sq.km in 1920. Best suitable habitats of RET and endemic species have reduced by 0.08% and 0.22% respectively. Habitat reduction has mainly occurred in the districts of Gajapati (Odisha state), Mahbubnagar (Telangana state) and also in Nallamalai and Kolli hill ranges. The species mostly spread across and the suitable habitats was found outside the rages of protected areas. From the present study we recommend that appropriate conservation strategies should be initiated on these threatened areas to prevent further decline in the extent and habitat quality of the RET and endemic species in Eastern Ghats.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (214KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Biodiversity values of abandoned teak, Tectona grandis plantations in southern Western Ghats: Is there a need for management intervention?'
Author: 'S.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAbandoned plantations could potentially support a large number of native tree species through succession and restore the original tree community. In order to assess the ability of abandoned teak plantations to recover through regeneration, teak stands from 29 to 80 years old were sampled for seedling and sapling density, species richness and the use by large ungulates in the southern Western Ghats using 10\xc2\xa0m circular plots. The influence of the forest-plantation edge was also studied. There was regeneration of a species-rich tree community in the understorey of abandoned teak plantations. However, regeneration was arrested, and thereby the large girth-class tree community remained species-poor. There was no significant change in the tree species richness with distance from natural forest, suggesting that the forest-plantation edge had little influence on the penetration of native tree species inside plantations. Asian elephant and Indian gaur dung densities were significantly lower in the plantations than in the forest. Indian gaur and sambar used the younger plantations intensively, and the density of their dung was negatively correlated with age of the plantation. Abandonment of mature teak stands arrested the succession of native trees. We provide evidence that abandoned teak plantations might not serve as suitable habitats for large herbivores during the dry months of the year in the region. The study highlights the need for active management of mature teak plantations inside wildlife reserves, in order to promote succession and improve the habitat for wild flora and fauna in the Western Ghats.ZusammenfassungAufgegebene Plantagen k\xc3\xb6nnten m\xc3\xb6glicherweise eine gro\xc3\x9fe Anzahl einheimischer Baumarten durch Sukzession erhalten und die urspr\xc3\xbcngliche Baumgesellschaft wieder herstellen.

Es gab keinen signifikanten Unterschied im Artenreichtum der B\xc3\xa4ume in Abh\xc3\xa4ngigkeit vom Abstand zu nat\xc3\xbcrlichem Wald, so dass vermutet werden kann, dass der Waldrand nur einen geringen Effekt auf das Einwandern der einheimischen Baumarten in die Plantage hat.

Indische Gaur und Sambarhirsche nutzten die jungen Plantagen intensiv und die Dungdichte war negativ mit dem Alter der Plantagen korreliert.

Abstract: 'AbstractUnplanned large scale developmental projects in recent times have been causing alterations in land use land cover [LULC] at spatial and temporal scales with the substantial changes in the landscape. Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human\xe2\x80\x93animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355\xc2\xa0Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072\xc2\xa0Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022. This necessitates framing appropriate policy measures to sustain natural resources focusing on the landscape\xe2\x80\x99s ecological, hydrological, economic and social factors.'

Title: 'Research PaperAssessing the impact of land use and land cover changes on the remnant patches of Kondapalli reserve forest of the Eastern Ghats, Andhra Pradesh, India'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Kondapalli reserve forest (KRF) of the Eastern Ghats, India is subjected to severe anthropogenic interference, despite its status as reserve forest. The present research focuses on assessing the land use and land cover changes in and around KRF using temporal satellite data. It is evident from the current study that there has been a considerable decrease in the forest cover from 1990 to 2015; as seen from 2017 data, huge urban expansions and development activities were observed around KRF. This increase is linked to the growth in population, thereby consuming land available for their basic needs. To assess the rate of urban expansion around the forest, Land consumption rate and Land absorption coefficient were computed. The result of this analysis showed a rapid growth in built-up land between 1990 and 2017 while the periods between 1990 and 2015 witnessed a reduction in the forest class. Further, the study projected adverse impact of the growth of the new capital city-Amaravati on the KRF and proposed requiring suitable conservation measures with respect to its current deforestation and degradation trends.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Colonial foresters misperceived Indian tropical grasslands as degraded ecosystems.\xe2\x80\xa2This led to natural tropical grassland transformation into exotic tree plantations.\xe2\x80\xa2Exotic trees became invasive in grasslands, causing biodiversity and habitat loss.\xe2\x80\xa2Even today, tropical grasslands are misperceived, mismanaged, & threatened globally.\xe2\x80\xa2Without recognition as legitimate ecosystems, these grasslands face a bleak future.AbstractColonial encounters with tropical ecosystems were primarily driven by profit-oriented management practices; witness the extensive network of timber and forestry practices that were set up across colonial India. In contrast, the colonial engagement with the montane forest-grassland mosaics of the higher reaches of the Western Ghats in southern India was marked by intensive investment in vegetation management by colonial foresters that yielded no profits. In this archival study, we trace the history of extensive vegetation transformation in this landscape from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. We show how the misperception that the grasslands within this mosaic must have resulted from tree felling, fire-setting and buffalo grazing by indigenous communities led colonial foresters into a century-long effort at \xe2\x80\x98foresting\xe2\x80\x99 the grasslands, primarily through large-scale planting of exotic tree species. These efforts persisted despite economic losses and ecological evidence that native tree seedlings planted in the grasslands repeatedly failed to establish. These policies continued unabated into the late twentieth century in newly independent India. Today, the once picturesque landscapes of these ancient forest-grassland mosaics are diminished by large-scale plantations of exotic species. Some of these species have become invasive and pose significant threats to the remnant natural grasslands. While this historical narrative is set in the forest-grassland mosaics of southern India, it finds striking parallels in the current day, with grasslands and savannas globally threatened by the misperception that they are \xe2\x80\x98degraded ecosystems\xe2\x80\x99 that can be \xe2\x80\x98forested\xe2\x80\x99 or converted to other \xe2\x80\x98productive\xe2\x80\x99 land uses. We suggest that this case history portends the potential fates of many of earth's threatened tropical grasslands and savannas."

Title: 'Spatiotemporal analysis of the effects of forest covers on stream water quality in Western Ghats of peninsular India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Studies the effect of mixed forest cover on stream water quality in tropics.\xe2\x80\xa2Quantifies the impact of forest cover on important water quality parameters.\xe2\x80\xa2Observes contrasting response of the old and disturbed forests on water quality.\xe2\x80\xa2Observes tradeoff between provisioning services and hydrological services of forests.SummaryThe hydrological research has largely concentrated on two extremes \xe2\x80\x93 undisturbed forest cover versus cleared forest land, whereas most tropical forest areas are now a mix of secondary vegetation, and old forest interspersed with patches cleared for agriculture or other non-forest use (Bruijnzeel, 2004; Giambelluca, 2002). For this reason, research on spatiotemporal variations in the effects of a mix of primary forest, mature secondary forests and disturbed forests on stream water quality was conducted in four watersheds in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. The study indicated that every one percent decrease in the forest cover (all lands with tree cover of canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of one ha) increases turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS) and Escherichia coli by 8.41%, 4.17% and 3.91%, respectively as also decreases calcium hardness by 0.49%. However, when the forest cover was segregated into old forests (primary forest, mature secondary forest and undisturbed mature plantations) and, open and disturbed forests the old forests were observed to significantly improve (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) most water quality parameters. In contrast the open and disturbed forests were observed to deteriorate the observed water quality parameters except for turbidity and TSS. The magnitudes of regression coefficients indicated that the old forests were 2.2 and 2.74 times more effective than the disturbed forests in reducing turbidity and TSS, respectively. Tradeoffs between the provisioning services and water quality improvement services of the forest were apparent.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper investigates the ways in which different groups of people arrive at decisions regarding what tree species to plant. Data is drawn from a case study of afforestation that is taking place under the policy of Joint Forest Planning and Management in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, India.

Abstract: 'AbstractSpatial information at the landscape scale is extremely important for conservation planning, especially in the case of long-ranging vertebrates. The biodiversity-rich Anamalai hill ranges in the Western Ghats of southern India hold a viable population for the long-term conservation of the Asian elephant. Through rapid but extensive field surveys we mapped elephant habitat, corridors, vegetation and land-use patterns, estimated the elephant population density and structure, and assessed elephant\xe2\x80\x93human conflict across this landscape. GIS and remote sensing analyses indicate that elephants are distributed among three blocks over a total area of about 4600\xc2\xa0km2. Approximately 92% remains contiguous because of four corridors; however, under 4000\xc2\xa0km2 of this area may be effectively used by elephants. Nine landscape elements were identified, including five natural vegetation types, of which tropical moist deciduous forest is dominant. Population density assessed through the dung count method using line transects covering 275\xc2\xa0km of walk across the effective elephant habitat of the landscape yielded a mean density of 1.1 (95% CI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.99\xe2\x80\x931.2)\xc2\xa0elephant/km2. Population structure from direct sighting of elephants showed that adult male elephants constitute just 2.9% and adult females 42.3% of the population with the rest being sub-adults (27.4%), juveniles (16%) and calves (11.4%). Sex ratios show an increasing skew toward females from juvenile (1:1.8) to sub-adult (1:2.4) and adult (1:14.7) indicating higher mortality of sub-adult and adult males that is most likely due to historical poaching for ivory. A rapid questionnaire survey and secondary data on elephant\xe2\x80\x93human conflict from forest department records reveals that villages in and around the forest divisions on the eastern side of landscape experience higher levels of elephant\xe2\x80\x93human conflict than those on the western side; this seems to relate to a greater degree of habitat fragmentation and percentage farmers cultivating annual crops in the east. We provide several recommendations that could help maintain population viability and reduce elephant\xe2\x80\x93human conflict of the Anamalai elephant landscape.'

Title: 'A comparative analysis of spatial, temporal, and ecological characteristics of forest fires in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems in the Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Narendran'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811270800399X
Abstract: 'AbstractThe Western Ghats in India is one of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity, and it is the hotspot with the highest human density. This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900\xc2\xa0ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration.'

But valuation and BCA have also attracted criticisms. \xe2\x80\x98Internal\xe2\x80\x99 criticisms point to the absence of alternative scenarios in valuation, overlooking of ecological trade-offs and dis-services, and inattention to context. Others criticize aggregation across diverse stakeholders and the problem of non-monetizable benefits, and dismiss BCA as fatally flawed. They suggest approaches such as deliberative decision-making and multi-criteria analysis. We propose a middle path that uses the strengths of economic analysis for decision support while avoiding the pitfalls. We disaggregate economic impacts by stakeholder groups, link ecosystem changes to benefits as well as dis-benefits, and examine how socio-technological context shapes the magnitude of economic impact. We illustrate this approach by studying the impact of creating the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple wildlife sanctuary in the Western Ghats forests of southern India. Our analysis shows that while some stakeholders are net beneficiaries, others are net losers. Changes in forest rights, irrigation technologies, and ecosystem dynamics influence the magnitude of benefits and sometimes convert gainers into losers. Such disaggregated analysis can provide useful information for deliberative decision-making and important academic insights on how economic value is generated.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGlobal biodiversity has already been altered by the climatic changes in various means like species migration, changes in habitat distribution, seasonality changes in phenology etc. In order to implement sustainable conservation or adaptation strategy, it is necessary to understand the impacts of climate change on both ecosystem and species level. Here we present an assessment on current and future habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides Gaertn. (MD), a medicinally and ecologically important tree species by using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model. The future predictions were done for the year 2050 and 2070 using the bioclimatic variables having 1\xc2\xa0km spatial resolution from two different models of fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5). This study was carried out in the Kolli hill, Eastern Ghats of India. The AUC values confirmed the accuracy of model prediction based on 22 occurrence points. Environmental variables\xe2\x80\x99 contributions were evaluated using jackknife test. The more influencing variables will be annual temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation of wettest month. Finally, this study found that there will be a significant reduction in the habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides in the year 2050 and 2070 in the study area. Hence with the performance of the model, this study found that MaxEnt could be an effective tool for species rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation planning in the light of climate change.'

Title: 'Poverty, biodiversity and institutions in forest-agriculture ecotones in the Western Ghats and Eastern Himalaya ranges of India'
Author: 'Kamaljit S.'

Abstract: "AbstractForest-agricultural ecotones are defined as areas that adjoin forests and other natural habitats and that lie between forests and zones of intensive agriculture. These ecotones are critical for conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest-agriculture ecotones? (2) How can forest-agriculture ecotones contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture ecotones? We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, in the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE's interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest-agriculture ecotones. Simultaneously, ATREE's interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that play a critical role in the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive, strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture ecotones by the governmental agencies and international organizations. We argue that forest-agriculture ecotones offer a means to conserve biodiversity through alleviation of poverty and development of community-based institutions."

Title: 'Spatiotemporal analysis of the effects of forest covers on water yield in the Western Ghats of peninsular India'
Author: 'Sunita'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216941200296X
Abstract: 'SummaryBiotic interference has greatly disturbed the forest cover, the forest soils and, therefore, the hydrological functioning of the forest (Bonell and Bruijnzeel, 2005). Though widely debated, reduction in water yield (Water Yield: Total quantity of surface water that can be expected in a given period from a stream at the outlet of its catchment (Subramanya, 2008)) appears to be one such consequence. Scientific understanding of how this contentious issue affects the benefits of forests for water is critical to avoid unintended consequences (IUFRO, 2007). Gaps in research exist for tropical forest areas that are now a general mix of primary forest and secondary vegetation interspersed with patches cleared for agriculture or other non-forest uses (Bruijnzeel, 2004, Giambelluca, 2002). For this reason, research on spatiotemporal variations in the effects of a mix of primary forest (Primary Forests: Old forests with no or inconsequential human disturbance), mature secondary forests (Secondary Forests: Forests regenerating largely through natural processes after significant human and/or natural disturbance of the original forest vegetation at a single point in time or over an extended period, and displaying a major difference in forest structure and/or canopy species composition with respect to nearby primary forests on similar sites (Chokkalingam and Jong, 2001)) and disturbed forests (Disturbed Forests: Forests that have been exploited on moderate to large scale for timber, fuel wood, fodder, shifting cultivation and other tangible benefits. Reforestation activities may or may not have been undertaken in them) on runoff coefficients was conducted in four watersheds in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. Forest cover (Forest Cover: All lands with tree cover of canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of one Ha) significantly (0.01\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) and positively influenced the runoff coefficient and, thus, the water yield. Despite wide variations in the forest cover, the Tulsi Watershed having mainly primary forests, the Tansa having over 52% forest cover of primary and mature secondary forests and nearly 60\xe2\x80\x9370% of forest cover of Bhatsa and Upper Vaitarna being disturbed forests, the impact of forest cover on runoff coefficient did not vary significantly from one watershed to the other. However, when the forest cover was segregated into old forests (primary forest, mature secondary forest and undisturbed mature plantations) and mixed forests (disturbed forests and to lesser extent naturally occurring open forest (Open Forests: All lands with tree cover of canopy density between 10% and 40%)), the old forests were observed to positively and highly significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) influence runoff coefficient. In contrast, the mixed forests exhibited negative trend that was not statistically significant. The change in water yield in relation to the changes in forest cover is quantified for three watersheds that face moderate to heavy biotic pressure.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Studies the effect of mixed forest cover on runoff coefficient in tropics. \xe2\x96\xba Loss of old/mature forests observed to reduce runoff coefficient. \xe2\x96\xba Loss of forests that are largely disturbed increased runoff coefficient. \xe2\x96\xba In mixed scenario runoff coefficient net result of the individual influences. \xe2\x96\xba Tradeoff between provisioning services and hydrological services of old forests.'

Title: 'AnalysisThe economics of biodiversity conservation: a study of a coffee growing region in the Western Ghats of India'
Author: 'K.N.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper analyses the economics of biodiversity conservation in the context of a tropical forest ecosystem in the Western Ghats region of India, where coffee is the main competitor for land use. Using primary data covering a cross-section of coffee growers, the study notes that the opportunity costs of biodiversity conservation in terms of coffee benefits foregone are quite high. Even after including external costs due to wildlife damages and defensive expenditure to protect against wildlife, the NPVs and IRRs from coffee for all land holding groups were high. Including external costs, these NPVs across different land holding groups ranged between Rs 17 thousand to over Rs 106 thousand per acre at 12% discount rate, and the IRRs between 16.6% and 23%. Even if the expected benefits were to decrease by 20% and costs rise by a similar proportion, still the IRRs from coffee were quite high (19.5\xe2\x80\x9320.1%). The study notes that the external costs accounted for between 7% and 15% of the total discounted costs of coffee cultivation, and smaller holdings proportionately incurred higher external costs as compared to large holdings. The study also notes high transaction costs incurred by the growers to claim compensation for wildlife damages. Notwithstanding these disincentives, the study notes that the local community had a positive attitude towards biodiversity conservation and were willing to pay in terms of spending time for participatory biodiversity conservation. Taking elephants, a keystone and threatened species in Asia and the study region, for the contingent valuation survey, the study notes that the respondents are willing to spend 25.8 humandays per household annually which works to over Rs 6003 per household per annum in terms of the income foregone. They also preferred a decentralized government institution for participatory biodiversity conservation.'

However, for Gambian HAT (gHAT), this link is not supported by field data, which show foci of disease unrelated either to tsetse distribution or fly infection rates.The focal nature of gHAT and Rhodesian HAT (rHAT) may relate to differences within human populations in susceptibility to or tolerance of trypanosome infection, evolved during the Bantu expansion period.Epidemics of gHAT emerge when trypanotolerant silent carriers of disease are stressed, particularly by famine, entraining epigenetic events and generational epidemic cycling.This view challenges present policy around diagnosis and treatment of gHAT that demands visualisation of parasites before treatment can commence. If HAT is to be eliminated as a public health problem by 2030, investments will be needed to improve early diagnosis paying special attention to women of child-bearing age.Epidemics of both forms of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) are confined to spatially stable foci in Sub-Saharan Africa while tsetse distribution is widespread. Infection rates of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in tsetse are extremely low and cannot account for the catastrophic epidemics of Gambian HAT (gHAT) seen over the past century. Here we examine the origins of gHAT epidemics and evidence implicating human genetics in HAT epidemiology. We discuss the role of stress causing breakdown of heritable tolerance in silent disease carriers generating gHAT outbreaks and see how peculiarities in the epidemiologies of gHAT and Rhodesian HAT (rHAT) impact on strategies for disease control.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Karl W. Butzer opened up an important line of historical geomorphology on the human use of landforms.\xe2\x80\xa2Human use of landforms encompasses defensive, commercial, and sacred, as well as natural resource-driven processes.\xe2\x80\xa2The Deccan Volcanic Plateau has supported at least four major precolonial landform-settlement configurations over the past two millennia.\xe2\x80\xa2Collectively, these configurations have shaped the formation of a coherent geocultural region.AbstractThis paper takes its inspiration from Karl W. Butzer's course on the Human Use of Landforms at the University of Chicago. It builds upon that concept through an exploration of regional settlement patterns and landforms in the Deccan volcanic province of west-central India. The first section develops a conceptual framework for analyzing human adjustment to landforms on regional, settlement, and site scales. The second section employs that framework to analyze four major landform-settlement configurations in the Deccan from antiquity to the end of the eighteenth century. The Satavahana kingdom (ca. 100\xe2\x80\xafBCE to 200\xe2\x80\xafCE) had a strong southeast to northwest alignment along the Godavari River lineament. Their capital city of Paithan was located at a navigable sacred ford across the river (tirtha), which was linked with upstream confluences (sangams), tanks (kunds), mountain passes (ghats), and port cities on the Arabian Sea. Subsequent Hindu dynasties (ca. 850\xe2\x80\x931300\xe2\x80\xafCE) shifted from fluvial landforms to a north-south alignment along steep mesa escarpments and buttes that provided defensive fortress and cave temple sites. Sultanate and Mughal forces expanded the urban footprint on nearby plateau lands at sites protected by surrounding mesas (ca. 1330\xe2\x80\x931700\xe2\x80\xafCE). These cities were supported by local watershed runoff and long distance water channels. The final precolonial phase of Deccan settlement entailed a shift from the semiarid central plateaus to humid headwaters of the Western Ghats, whose buttes and scarps provided sites for scores of forts controlled by the founder of the Maratha empire Chhatrapati Shivaji in the seventeenth century. Maratha success led to development downstream at the capital city of Pune (1627\xe2\x80\x931803\xe2\x80\xafCE), located at a river confluence flanked by mesas, which combined the strategies of previous periods. Over two millennia these four distinct, yet intersecting, patterns of human-landform relations have shaped an evolving geocultural region on the Deccan plateau that deserves comparison with other flood basalt regions."

Title: 'The groundwater recharge response and hydrologic services of tropical humid forest ecosystems to use and reforestation: Support for the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Unique data on hydrologic effects of tropical reforestation and human-use.\xe2\x80\xa2Clear evidence for the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d in relation to hydrologic services.\xe2\x80\xa2Comprehensive paper on hydrology of Western Ghats, a globalbiodiversity hotspot.\xe2\x80\xa2Hydrologic processes and recharge to ground-water across land-coveranalyzed using multiple approaches and spatial scales.SummaryThe hydrologic effects of forest use and reforestation of degraded lands in the humid tropics has implications for local and regional hydrologic services but such issues have been relatively less studied when compared to the impacts of forest conversion. In particular, the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis which predicts a net gain or loss to baseflow and dry-season flow under both, forest degradation or reforestation depending on conditions has not been tested adequately. In the Western Ghats of India, we examined the hydrologic responses and groundwater recharge and hydrologic services linked with three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest(DF), and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. Instrumented catchments ranging from 7 to 23\xc2\xa0ha representing these three land-covers (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF, in total 11 basins), were established and maintained between 2003 and 2005 at three sites in two geomorphological zones, Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad). Four larger (1\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0km2) catchments downstream of the head-water catchments in the Malnaad with varying proportions of different land-cover and providing irrigation water for areca-nut and paddy rice were also measured for post-monsoon baseflow. Daily hydrological and climate data was available at all the sites. In addition, 36\xc2\xa0min data was available at the Coastal site for 41\xc2\xa0days as part of the opening phase of the summer monsoon, June\xe2\x80\x93July 2005.Low potential and actual evapotranspiration rates during the monsoon that are similar across all land-cover ensures that the main control on the extent of groundwater recharge during the south-west monsoon is the proportion of rainfall that is converted into quick flow rather than differences in evapotranspiration between the different land cover types. The Flow duration curves demonstrated a higher frequency and longer duration of low flows under NF when compared to the other more disturbed land covers in both the Coastal and Malnaad basins. Groundwater recharge estimated using water balance during the wet-season in the Coastal basins under NF, AC and DF was estimated to be 50%, 46% and 35% respectively and in the Malnaad it was 61%, 55% and 36% respectively. Soil Water Infiltration and Movement (SWIM) based recharge estimates also support the pattern (46% in NF; 39% in AC and 14% in DF). Furey\xe2\x80\x93Gupta filter based estimates associated with the Coastal basins also suggest similar groundwater recharge values and trends across the respective land-covers: 69% in NF, 49% in AC, and 42% in DF. Soil water potential profiles using zero flux plane methods suggest that during the dry-season, natural forests depend on deep soil moisture and groundwater. Catchments with higher proportion of forest cover upstream were observed to sustain flow longer into the dry-season. These hydrologic responses provide some support towards the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration-evapotranspiration trade-off\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis in which differences in infiltration between land-cover rather than evapotranspiration determines the differences in groundwater recharge, low flows and dry-season flow. Groundwater recharge is the most temporally stable under natural forest, although substantial recharge occurs under all three ecosystems, which helps to sustain dry-season flow downstream in higher order streams that sustain local communities and agro-ecosystems. In addition to spatial scale effects, greater attention also needs to be given to the role of hydrogeology within the context of the above hypothesis and its implications for hydrologic services.'

Title: 'Research PaperHydrogeological delineation of groundwater vulnerability to droughts in semi-arid areas of western Ahmednagar district'
Author: 'Renie'

Abstract: 'AbstractGroundwater, a renewable and finite natural resource, is a vital source of sustenance for humans and different ecosystems in the semi-arid regions. Rapid population growth in the last three decades has caused a rise in water demand which has inadvertently posed a stress on its availability. Occurrence of groundwater in the Deccan Volcanic Province is governed by the subsurface hydrogeological heterogeneity of basaltic lava flows and by the presence of geological structures like dykes, sills and fractures that influence spatial & vertical groundwater flow. The main objective of this paper is to map and assess areas that are naturally most susceptible to groundwater scarcity and at risk of depletion due to over extraction. The current study involves a field hydrogeological mapping that was integrated with remote sensing and GIS to delineate areas. This technique was based on using different thematic layers viz. lithology, slope, land-use and land cover, lineament, drainage, soil type, depth to groundwater and annual rainfall. Additionally, pumping tests were carried out to classify the study area into different hydrogeological typologies to help delineate communities that are most vulnerable to subsurface heterogeneity. This paper attempts to underline the groundwater scarcity zones based on different influencing thematic layers and provide a robust methodology to prioritize areas vulnerable to groundwater unavailability, by categorizing the study area into different vulnerable class types \xe2\x80\x93 extreme, high, moderate and low.'

Tourism has long been linked with spirituality and where this is the case (for example pilgrimage travel), it is considered to pave the way for personal transformation. Linking spiritual tourism to yoga tourism is a fait accompli, as is drawing similar associations with wellness and pilgrimage tourism on account of allied and abiding motivations predicated on uniting mind, body and spirit and these ruminations are central to this paper. More recently, there has been a growing chorus calling for the decolonisation of yoga on account of its commodification and industrialisation, and especially concerning what is argued to be a shift away from its spiritual and transformative tenets. The underlying meaning of the Sanskrit word yuj from which yoga is derived alludes to the pursuit of achieving a sense of union with something higher than oneself, and this is arguably one of the key drivers for its contemporary acceptance. Linkages between spirituality and yoga tourism through an examination of the motivations of Western yoga devotees in Maharashtra, India provide the canvas for this analysis. The motivations for yoga related travel and the broader implications for yoga and spiritual tourism are discussed. This article draws from two periods of exploratory fieldwork conducted in 2014 and 2015 in Maharashtra, India. A qualitative, case study scaffold underpinned by serious leisure as a conceptual framework (Stebbins, 2001) was constructed.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Inter-regional heterogeneity in monsoon variability and its impacts were investigated at district level in Maharashtra.\xe2\x80\xa2We demonstrate the need for separate district-level plans for action on climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Information regarding the cropping pattern for the districts showing highest monsoon variability has been provided.\xe2\x80\xa2Districts were ranked to help the government in specifying the expenditure in different sectors.\xe2\x80\xa2District-scale adaptation measures to help formulate better policies for farmers.AbstractIndian Summer Monsoon (ISM) variability has always been a feature affecting Indian agriculture. However, nature of this variability is varying in the backdrop of climate change, and as a consequence, agriculture is getting significantly affected and subsequently threatening food security. To address the climate variability, most of the studies conducted so far have focused on a coarse scale such as Central India or Western Ghats. However, finer scale analysis for identification and quantification of the link between agriculture vulnerability and climate variables has not yet been attempted in a comprehensive manner. The latter is essential, as considering state and national domain as a single entity for regional level policy formulations have led to under-representation of grievances and issue related to agriculture and farmers in the past. In order to address these issues, focus of the current study is on finer scale analysis of districts of Maharashtra state in Western India. Inter and intra-regional spatio-temporal heterogeneity in monsoon variability parameters was found across districts of Maharashtra. Here, we ranked the districts of Maharashtra using monsoon variability index which includes six different monsoon variability parameters (Wet/Dry Spells, frequency/intensity of extreme rainfall events, deviation from the long-period average and daily-scale variability) by using factor analysis. Monsoon variability index indicated that districts under Vidarbha and Marathwada regions are at highest risk and need immediate attention from decision-makers and scientists. This index was further linked to average yield and cropped area using Structural equation modeling that will help to determine the ideal cropping pattern for the most vulnerable districts. An empirical model of monsoon variability is also proposed at district level for the state of Maharashtra that can contribute to the currently operating \xe2\x80\x98State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC)\xe2\x80\x99 or can be used to formulate a new action plan at district level i.e. \xe2\x80\x98District Action Plan on Climate Change (DAPCC)\xe2\x80\x99. The current study differs from other studies in terms of its application, levels of spatial aggregation and areas of coverage. The findings can be utilized by farmers and policy makers while formulating agricultural policies, risk reduction measures, and adaptation mechanisms to address the adverse impacts of climate change.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (153KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Invasiveness of two plants with varied phenology was assessed using modelling.\xe2\x80\xa2Use of three models abetted identifying determinants with reasonable poise.\xe2\x80\xa2Species with advantages of growth complementarity could succeed invasion.\xe2\x80\xa2Study of multiple species invasion in overlain niches offers management inputs.AbstractUnderstanding the impact of climate change on species invasion is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation. Through this study, we try to answer how species differing in phenological cycles, specifically Cassia tora and Lantana camara, differ in the manner in which they invade new regions in India in the future climate. Since both species occupy identical niches, exploring their invasive potential in different climate change scenarios will offer critical insights into invasion and inform ecosystem management. We use three modelling protocols (i.e., maximum entropy, generalised linear model and generalised additive model) to predict the current distribution. Projections are made for both moderate (A1B) and extreme (A2) IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios for the year 2050 and 2100. The study reveals that the distributions of C.\xc2\xa0tora (annual) and L.\xc2\xa0camara (perennial) would depend on the precipitation of the warmest quarter and moisture availability. C.\xc2\xa0tora may demonstrate physiological tolerance to the mean diurnal temperature range and L.\xc2\xa0camara to the solar radiation. C.\xc2\xa0tora may invade central India, while L.\xc2\xa0camara may invade the Western Himalaya, parts of the Eastern Himalaya and the Western Ghats. The distribution ranges of both species could shift in the northern and north-eastern directions in India, owing to changes in moisture availability. The possible alterations in precipitation regimes could lead to water stress, which might have cascading effects on species invasion. L.\xc2\xa0camara might adapt to climate change better compared with C.\xc2\xa0tora. This comparative analysis of the future distributions of two invasive plants with contrasting habits demonstrates that temporal complementarity would prevail over the competition.'

Author: 'Mahmuda'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Fragmented forests stored 36% less carbon than contiguous forests together in tree biomass and in soils.\xe2\x80\xa2Structural variation and changes in tree allometry caused reduced carbon storage in forest fragments.\xe2\x80\xa2Carbon loss due to forest fragmentation should be considered in existing carbon accounting systems for tropical forests which is currently overlooked.AbstractForest fragmentation is continued to be widespread in the tropics resulting in reduced ecosystem services including carbon storage. However, the effect of forest fragmentation is not considered in the current carbon policy. We investigated the effect of forest fragmentation on tree biomass carbon and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh. Above and below-ground tree biomass carbon were calculated by using widely accepted allometric equations and SOC was measured by sampling soils up to 10\xc2\xa0cm depth and analyzing them in a soil laboratory. Results showed that carbon storage in tree biomass was significantly lower in fragmented forests (16.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.37\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) than in contiguous forests (31.21\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.75\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). Likewise, a significantly lower SOC was contained in the soils of fragmented forests (17.26\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.83\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) than in contiguous forests (21.62\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.78\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). Thus a total of 36% less carbon retained in tree biomass and soils in fragmented forests than in contiguous forests. Backward multiple linear regression analysis revealed tree density, tree height, tree DBH, height-diameter ratio (H/D) and tree species richness as influential factors of carbon variation in fragmented forests. All these structural parameters except tree species richness were significantly lower in fragmented forests, were positively associated with carbon storage and explained together 69% of the carbon storage variation. These findings suggest that the altered stand structure and tree allometry likely caused reduced carbon storage in fragmented forests and highlight the importance of landscape scale management intervention in the tropics. Here, we provided with the evidence of strong negative impact of forest fragmentation on carbon storage and argue that this effect should be in consideration which is currently overlooked in existing carbon accounting systems for tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMost of the world\xe2\x80\x99s remaining terrestrial biodiversity exists in tropical ecosystems affected by human activities. Despite the threats to seasonally dry tropical ecosystems, little is known about the impact of human land use change on their conservation value. We used savanna woodlands within the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot as a case study to understand the effects of human land use on plant diversity. We investigated the effects of three common land-use activities \xe2\x80\x93 biomass extraction, livestock grazing and ground fire \xe2\x80\x93 on species richness and diversity, as well as species composition in terms of the breadth of geographic ranges of species present. We found that total species richness increased with livestock grazing due to increased understory richness. Overstory diversity and tree sapling diversity and richness decreased with more recent fire. Greater canopy openness was associated with increased understory richness and reduced overstory richness. The combination of fire and livestock grazing are likely to increase canopy openness, leading to a shift in diversity from the overstory to the understory. Although we found no change in species richness or diversity with biomass extraction, areas with biomass extraction had more widely distributed species and fewer narrowly distributed species, indicating land use may lead to biotic homogenization. Our results suggest that a mosaic of protected areas along with areas managed for biomass extraction and livestock grazing would be an effective way to balance the conservation of plant diversity with local communities\xe2\x80\x99 needs while maintaining overall levels of plant species diversity in these savanna woodlands.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba We assessed the effects of moderate land use on savanna woodlands in South India. \xe2\x96\xba Moderate land use maintained overall plant diversity and species richness. \xe2\x96\xba Fire and livestock grazing shifted diversity from the overstory to the understory. \xe2\x96\xba Areas with biomass extraction had more common and fewer rare species. \xe2\x96\xba A mosaic of land uses could balance local needs with biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn India, conservation of biodiversity goes hand in hand with human welfare, as millions of people live adjacent or within protected areas and depend upon forests products. The high density and biomass requirements of these households could result in the degradation of forests and loss of biodiversity. We assessed the collection of forest products among households in five sites in the Western and Eastern Ghats of peninsular India: the Kogar region of the Central Western Ghats, the Bandipur and Sigur regions of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Kalakad\xe2\x80\x93Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of the southern Western Ghats and Similipal Tiger Reserve of the northern Eastern Ghats, and tested whether extraction pressure on forests was associated with the proportion of agricultural households, wage labour and population density. We also examined whether data on loss of cover as stated by the State of the Forest Reports was supported by field data. The regions differed in land use: Kogar, KMTR and Similipal were primarily agricultural regions, whereas households engaged in wage labour or in running small businesses were predominant in Sigur and Bandipur. Fuel\xe2\x80\x93wood was collected ubiquitously for household use in all sites, used mainly for domestic requirements and secondarily for generating income. Green leaves for making fertilizer and fodder were collected for household use and did not enter the market. Cattle manure for the global organic coffee industry was a major forest product in Bandipur and Sigur. Extraction pressure on forests was positively associated with the availability of wage labour and was negatively with the proportion of agricultural households. Data from official sources seem inadequate to measure forest degradation in protected forests. Accurate estimation of forest condition through field assessments and remote sensing, and understanding the socio-economic variables associated with forest loss and degradation are needed for the sustainable management of Indian protected areas.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2AMOVA using ISSR data revealed 43% and 57% variation, within and among the populations of S. asoca.\xe2\x80\xa2High variations of gallic acid, catechin and epicatechin was observed by HPLC.\xe2\x80\xa2Study advocates delineate provenance regions of S. asoca for conservation.AbstractSaraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde (Caesalpiniaceae) is a highly traded IUCN red listed tree species used in Ayurvedic medicines for the treatment of various disorders, especially gynaecological problems. However, information about the genetic variations between populations and corresponding variation in specialized metabolites of S. asoca remains unclear. To address this issue, we analysed 11 populations of S. asoca with 106 accessions collected from Western Ghats of India using ISSR markers along with selected phytocompounds using RP-HPLC. Twenty primers were screened, out of which seven were selected for further analysis based on generation of clear polymorphic banding patterns. These seven ISSR primers produced 74 polymorphic loci. AMOVA showed 43% genetic variation within populations and 57% among the populations of S. asoca. To estimate the genetic relationships among S. asoca populations, UPGMA and Bayesian Models were constructed, which revealed two clusters of similar grouping patterns. However, excluding minor deviations, UPGMA and dissimilarity analysis showed close association of genotypes according to their geographical locations. Catechin (CAT), epicatechin (EPI) and gallic acid (GA) were quantified from bark and leaf samples of corresponding genotypes collected from 106 accessions. ROC plots depicted the sensitivity and specificity of the concentrations of tested phytocompounds at various cut-off points. Although, multiple logistic regression analysis predicted some association between few loci with GA, EPI and CAT, but PCA for phytochemical data failed to distinguish the populations. Overall, there were no significant trends observed to distinguish the populations based on these phytocompounds. Furthermore, the study advocates the delineate provenance regions of S. asoca genotypes/chemotype snapshots for in-situ conservation and ex-situ cultivation.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (332KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractHigh population pressure and the rapid pace of human activity including urbanization, industrialization and other economic activities have led to a dwindling supply of arable land per capita as well as water, especially ground water in underdeveloped countries. This has entailed considerable damage to the physical environment, including degradation and depletion of natural resources and unsustainable use of land and water resources. With the impact of climate change, the depletion of water resources will be faster both at the ground as well as the surface level due to rising temperatures in the region. This paper underscores the need for an eclectic approach to policy responses stemming from private and common property rights theories, externality theory and sustainability theory with a view to managing groundwater availability for the poor in terms of equity and sustainability in South Asia, China and Africa.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWater is essential for all living beings. It is a major concern to provide water to all. It is a challenge to supply water to all major cities in Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka, India. Nethravathi River is one of the major sources of water in the region which yields about 1240TMC per year. Nethravathi River has its origins in Western Ghats of Karnataka flowing to a length of 126 Km and joins Arabian Sea. In Dakshina Kannada district all major cities face water scarcity in summer season even after getting an average annual rainfall of 3.75 \xe2\x80\x93 4.25 m. It is a major challenge to the district administration for providing required water to the people during summer season in spite of plenty of water available during monsoon. This paper highlights in giving solution to this issue after studying various parameters like geographical structure, rainfall data and climate, study of catchment area, storage methods, water demand and water supply schemes available in the region. An attempt has been made to suggest for supplying the water to the cities in Dakshina Kannada district by increasing the storage capacity on the upstream side of the river to get water round the clock.'

Abstract: 'AbstractOur understanding of the role of institutions and property-rights regimes in natural resource management has matured through the work of new institutional economists and common-property theorists. Even so, this literature has yet to establish clear connections between successful resource management, and a given property regime\xe2\x80\x99s spatio-temporal fit. Examining people\xe2\x80\x93forest interaction within a state-managed forest regime in India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats, this paper argues that regime efficacy in satisfying user needs, hinges on appropriately reflecting particular sociospatial contexts and incorporating temporal flexibility into its normative structure. To these ends, this study analyzes institutional structure regulating forest use and management, and examines data collected through extensive fieldwork, in-depth interviews and informal conversations with local villagers and foresters. The results suggest that user responses to access conditions, and their rationales for engaging in particular extraction practices, vary based on caste/class-based perceptions of regime legitimacy, distributional equity, and historical proprietorship rights. Furthermore, the analysis questions the viability of locally managed regimes under such heterogeneous social settings. Rather, this research recognizes the state\xe2\x80\x99s vital role in mediating resource access. It suggests that regime efficacy can be fostered through state\xe2\x80\x93civil society partnerships, widely distributed stakeholder-ship and firmly embedded regimes that adapt to changing sociospatial contexts through modifications to conditions of use and access. Based on the analysis, this paper explores an initial set of sociospatial and temporal parameters that promote institutional efficacy in management, and thus lays the groundwork for future studies in institutional and political ecology.'

The Xiangshan Group is older than the Middle Ordovician strata in the study region and is the Middle\xe2\x80\x93Late Cambrian in age, which is the same age as the fossils found in it. The detrital zircon ages record the Grenville and Pan-African Orogenic Events, and the major age peaks are 963\xc2\xa0Ma, 1179\xc2\xa0Ma, 551\xc2\xa0Ma and 2517\xc2\xa0Ma. The North China Terrane, the Alxa Terrane and the Qilian Orogenic Belt were not the provenances of the Xiangshan Group. The age spectrum of the Xiangshan Group is similar to terranes associated with eastern Gondwana. The sandstone composition modes of the Xiangshan Group indicate that the source areas were the recycled orogenic belts. The zircons in the Xiangshan Group with an age peak at ca. 963\xc2\xa0Ma may come from the Eastern Ghats\xe2\x80\x93Rayner orogenic belt or other terranes located to the north of eastern Gondwana.

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Large spatial variation in ecosystem water use efficiency across India.\xe2\x80\xa2Higher ecosystem water use efficiency was found in lower Himalayan regions.\xe2\x80\xa2Out of 634 districts, only 241 districts were found resilient to dry conditions.\xe2\x80\xa2Out of 30 states and UTs, only 10 had more than 50% resilient area.\xe2\x80\xa2Forest dominated districts were more resilient, compared to others.AbstractThe carbon and water cycles play an important role in ecosystem functioning and are linked to each other through different physical and biological processes. The hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts affect both hydrological as well as the ecological processes. Increasing hydroclimatic disturbances under climate change will adversely affect the ecohydrological processes and hence, the assessment of the ecohydrological resilience and its controlling factors is important for the sustainability of the ecosystems. In this study, an assessment of the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems in India to hydroclimatic disturbances was carried out at the district (i.e. administrative division) scale. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe), defined as the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to evapotranspiration, was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances. We found a large spatial variation in WUEe in India at district scale, which was significantly higher in lower Himalayan regions compared to rest of the country. Increasing trend in WUEe was found for central parts of the country. The resilience was measured in terms of the ratio of the WUEe under the dry conditions and the mean WUEe, which indicates the ability to absorb hydroclimatic disturbance. Out of 634 districts considered for this study, only 241 (~38%) districts were found resilient to dry conditions, whereas a significant reduction in WUEe was observed for some of the districts. The resilience at district scale indicates the cross-biomes response of ecosystems. In general, the forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to districts dominated by other biome types. Also, districts having temperate climate were found having higher resilience. Out of 30 states and union territories (UTs) only 10 states had more than 50% resilient area. The results of this study highlight the need for better ecosystem management policies in the country.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Study pertains to the tropics.\xe2\x80\xa2Characterizes the relationships between forest cover, turbidity and treatment cost.\xe2\x80\xa2Estimates deforestation induced costs on drinking water treatment plant.\xe2\x80\xa2Highlights the need for municipalities to include forests in decision making.AbstractThe success of incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions hinges on the ability to quantify the ecosystem services, forecast the returns to the investments, convert these values into effective policy and finance mechanisms, and the presence of well-functioning institutions and infrastructure. However, ecosystem production functions i.e., the relationship between regulatory functions of the ecosystem and the economic activity it protects or supports are often poorly understood. Even with respect to Forest Watershed Services \xe2\x80\x93 a service that is widely recognized and even institutionalized through market based mechanisms in some parts of the world \xe2\x80\x93 the biophysical relationships between forests and services such as stream flow stabilization, water quality and water quantity are undefined, particularly for the tropics. For this reason, this study through time series data and multivariate analysis characterizes the relationships between Forest Cover (all lands with tree cover of a canopy density of 10% and above when projected vertically on the horizontal ground with minimum areal extent of 1\xc2\xa0ha), water quality and cost of water treatment in the Western Ghats of peninsular India. In particular, the recursive relationship between the economic and environmental components is estimated by tracing the effects through the two-stage model. Annual value of impacts (increased \xe2\x80\x98treatment cost\xe2\x80\x99, increased \xe2\x80\x98water losses due to backwash and desludging\xe2\x80\x99, and changes in \xe2\x80\x98water yield\xe2\x80\x99) induced by loss of Forest Cover is estimated as 64.96 Indian rupee/m3 treated water/ha/year ($1.32/m3 treated water/ha/year). At an annual rate of change in the forest cover by \xe2\x88\x920.0088% (average annual rate of change in the forest cover between the years 1994\xe2\x80\x932007) the deforestation induced costs translate to 3.73 million Indian rupee/year ($0.075\xc2\xa0million/year) according to the 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 prices for the Panjrapur treatment plant of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Thus, if deforestation is avoided the Municipal Corporation can save significant amount towards recurring costs of water treatment and to some extent mitigate the costs for the development of a new source.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We modelled potential population productivity and trajectories of West Australian white sharks.\xe2\x80\xa2Increase in population abundance varied from 2 to 6% per year under no fishing pressure.\xe2\x80\xa2No modelling scenario resulted in a total population increase of >31% since species protection.AbstractWhite sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are globally distributed, protected in several countries, including Australia, and potentially dangerous to humans. Following a recent spate of fatal white shark attacks, the Government of Western Australia introduced a range of initiatives to mitigate shark hazards. An increasing trend in shark attacks over the last 20 years has been commonly perceived to be the result of an increase in population abundance since the species\xe2\x80\x99 protection in Australian waters in 1997. We modelled potential population productivity and trajectories using different scenarios of life-history strategies, unexploited population sizes, reconstructed fishery catches and post-capture mortality. Under zero fishing mortality, the potential annual increase in population abundance varied from 2 to 6% per year, depending upon the assumed life history strategy. Depending upon model inputs there was a wide range of potential declines in abundance since 1938/39 and significant differences in the potential population trajectories since protection. However, no scenario (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0120) resulted in a total population increase of >31% since protection, with most scenarios showing population increase of 10% or less. We present a method for exploring the effects of alternative hypotheses about key population parameters when data are scarce and when scientific advice is required for guiding decision making and informing public debate.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe claim of aesthetic modernity arriving before social modernity (1) is being investigated with reference to \xe2\x80\x98intense experiments of city-making\xe2\x80\x99 in Kolkata. This brings into focus the socio-political inclination of packaging cities to fit a \xe2\x80\x98global image of efficiency\xe2\x80\x99. Here a deliberate attempt is made to look for specific geo-political appropriation and/or reproduction and/or rejection of both the global and the traditional aesthetic- thus identifying role of aesthetic convictions of the masses, the bourgeoisie and the State, in Asian experiments of worlding cities (2). The recent tendency in urban studies to locate the geography of authoritative knowledge in specific cases of the Global South is the context of this study (2). The paper would touch upon three beautification projects of Kolkata, at different stages of the post 90-s neo-liberalization era. The subversive claims of the politically conscious masses juxtaposed with the refusal of middle-class global aspirations to remain in the \xe2\x80\x98waiting rooms of history\xe2\x80\x99 (3) and simultaneous knee-jerk policies to compete for global capital provide an interesting case. Kolkata, both suffering from and celebrating its poignant urbanscape- presents a specific referent of how 21st century Indian cities are not just borrowing Western urban aesthetics but are \xe2\x80\x98inevitably home-grown\xe2\x80\x99 in their construction of appropriate aesthetics. The attempt here is limited to an examination of the desired image of the city, politically defined but socially negotiated, as a locus of possibilities, thus recognising the creativity and violence of space-making in Kolkata as a source of broadly relevant urban theory.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We describe the experiences of ATREE, a non-government environment think tank in India, in implementing its sustainability science programme.\xe2\x80\xa2During its 20 year history, the organization has achieved considerable success in generating interdisciplinary knowledge.\xe2\x80\xa2Despite success, a number of hurdles remain in fostering integration of concepts and approaches across disciplines.\xe2\x80\xa2ATREE's experience offers important insights to the conceptualization and implementation of sustainability science for other organizations.Rapidly accelerating local and global environmental change threatens societal well-being now and in the future in a variety of ways, especially in developing countries. A necessary condition for responding adequately to this environmental crisis is the generation of knowledge that speaks to policy and action, and is holistic, not fragmented along disciplinary lines. The idea of interdisciplinary applied research on the environment has been around since the early 1970s and has taken different institutional forms and labels. In developing countries such as India, the academic community has generally \xe2\x80\x98disciplined\xe2\x80\x99 environmental pedagogy into environmental \xe2\x80\x98science\xe2\x80\x99 programs, and academic research also continues largely on disciplinary lines. We review the experience of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, India, that was set up almost two decades ago as an effort to institutionalize an interdisciplinary and problem-oriented research and teaching paradigm. One key element of this effort has been an explicitly normative but broad set of concerns, including equity and democratic governance as integral aspects of conservation and sustainability. Another has been an emphasis on balancing academic rigor with social relevance, the latter achieved not just by speaking to policy makers, but by building collaborations with local communities and activist groups in a number of field sites. Finally, building an explicitly interdisciplinary PhD programme in spite of significant resource and other constraints has built a common perspective. In our analysis, we highlight factors that influence success, including clarity and a common understanding of the mission, human resources, resolution of perennial tensions between disciplinary and interdisciplinary work, commitment to the program structure, program and institutional leadership, and the framework for rewards and incentives. Availability of resources, political support, and the willingness of the state to accept and recognize the work of non-state actors are other major factors. ATREE's experience offers important insights to the conceptualization and implementation of sustainability studies programs elsewhere."

Abstract: 'AbstractCarbon assimilation defined as the overall rate of fixation of carbon through the process of photosynthesis is central to the climate change research.

The results indicate that the evergreen forest assimilate carbon at a higher rate while the rate is lower for montane grasslands. The comparison between the model results shows that there are large differences between these estimates, and that the spatial resolution of the input datasets plays a larger role than the algorithms of the models. The comparison exercise will be helpful for the refinement and development of the existing and future GPP models by incorporating the empirical environmental conditions.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba VPM and MODIS GPP product showed different carbon assimilation rates. \xe2\x96\xba The difference is due to the resolution of the input datasets than to the algorithm. \xe2\x96\xba Further research required to validate the estimates based on eddy covariance data.'

Abstract: 'AbstractForest fragmentation is considered as one of the major conservation issue. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1\xc2\xa0km2. At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187\xc2\xa0ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975\xe2\x80\x932005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA comprehensive methodology that integrates Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques was adopted to determine the soil erosion vulnerability of a forested mountainous sub-watershed in Kerala, India. The spatial pattern of annual soil erosion rate was obtained by integrating geo-environmental variables in a raster based GIS method. GIS data layers including, rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodability (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors were computed to determine their effects on average annual soil loss in the area. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 17.73\xc2\xa0t h-1 y-1 with a close relation to grass land areas, degraded forests and deciduous forests on the steep side-slopes (with high LS). The spatial erosion maps generated with RUSLE method and GIS can serve as effective inputs in deriving strategies for land planning and management in the environmentally sensitive mountainous areas.'

Abstract: 'AbstractPlanning and management decisions concerning forest resources require the integration of large volumes of disparate information from numerous sources, which in turn, need different techniques and tools. The present work attempts to develop an integrated range management decision support system (IRMDSS) to provide an interactive decision support tool for forest planners in the Western Ghats of India, which is one of the ecologically important areas of the Earth. The IRMDSS interface combines individual technologies such as remote sensing, a geographic information system (GIS) and a knowledge based system. The prototype IRMDSS was developed by customizing arcview gis software and coupling it other software using dynamic link libraries. The IRMDSS prototype provides forest planners and managers a better means of organizing, accessing, and evaluating a wide range of information and alternative strategies for effective forest planning and management in the study area.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We reviewed 31 ecosystem services assessments and 290 peer-reviewed studies throughout Asia.\xe2\x80\xa278 peer-reviewed studies using modeling approach were identified.\xe2\x80\xa2The modeling studies were classified based on processes evaluated by the models.\xe2\x80\xa2A bias in the geographic distribution was identified in the peer-reviewed studies.\xe2\x80\xa2Gaps exist in the approaches applied in the assessment cases and peer-reviewed studies.AbstractThe use of various modeling approaches is critical in the assessment of ecosystem services. Although numerous assessments have been conducted as scholarly studies to quantify, map, and value ecosystem services, a well-structured platform is necessary to ensure consistency of the assessment approaches with regard to theories and practices. To identify gaps between practical ecosystem services assessments and scholarly studies in the Asian region, we reviewed assessment cases in the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) catalogue and peer-reviewed literature using Web platforms. We identified 31 assessment cases and 290 such peer-reviewed studies conducted throughout Asia. Our review of recent peer-reviewed studies revealed a bias in the geographic distribution, with numerous Chinese studies and few studies in West Asia. Our comparison of the approaches applied in the assessment cases with those in the peer-reviewed studies revealed that little information on the models was reported in the assessment cases, whereas the approaches used in the peer-reviewed studies were mostly modeling and biophysical indicators. Although the modeling and scenario approaches used in the actual assessments require further clarification in the IPBES catalogue, many scientific modeling studies have been conducted throughout Asia. These scientific data, however, are not easily accessible to those outside of academic communities. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a new catalogue to guide all the stakeholders involved in ecosystem services assessment at multiple scales.'

Abstract: 'AbstractHunting is one of the greatest conservation challenges facing tropical wildlife. Wildlife in Indian tropical forests are vulnerable to hunting, although data on hunting impacts from the region are limited. We use a meta-analysis of 143 hunting studies from India to identify the species and geographic regions most at risk, and to assess their legal protection. We found evidence of hunting in 114 mammal species, with larger-bodied mammals being particularly vulnerable. Although 75% of all studies focused on mammals, few actually quantified hunting impacts. Further, among studies of all terrestrial vertebrates where hunting was mentioned, only 6% focused exclusively on hunting. With further research, we expect that the suite of species known to be exploited by hunters will increase. We conclude that the Eastern Himalaya and Indo-Myanmar biodiversity-hotspot complex is particularly vulnerable to hunting. Quantitative studies of hunting impacts are urgently needed across India, especially in this biodiversity-hotspot complex.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba We conduct a meta-analysis based on 143 hunting studies in India. \xe2\x96\xba We identify the vertebrate species and geographic regions most at risk, and assess their protection status. \xe2\x96\xba The Eastern Himalaya and Indo-Myanmar biodiversity-hotspot complex appears most vulnerable to hunting. \xe2\x96\xba Increasing research will likely increase the known number of species exploited by hunters.'

This paper provides an overview of climate risks to energy infrastructures in India and details two case studies \xe2\x80\x93 a crude oil importing port and a western coast railway transporting coal. The climate vulnerability of the port has been mapped using an index while that of the railway has been done through a damage function for RCP 4.5.0 and 8.5 scenarios. Our analysis shows that risk management through adaptation is likely to be very expensive. The system risks can be even greater and might adversely affect energy security and access objectives. Aligning sustainable development and climate adaptation measures can deliver substantial co-benefits. The key policy recommendations include: i) mandatory vulnerability assessment to future climate risks for energy infrastructures; ii) project and systemic risks in the vulnerability index; iii) adaptation funds for unmitigated climate risks; iv) continuous monitoring of climatic parameters and implementation of adaptation measures, and iv) sustainability actions along energy infrastructures that enhance climate resilience and simultaneously deliver co-benefits to local agents.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMonitoring the changes in forest-cover and understanding the dynamics of the forest is becoming increasingly important for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses temporal MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field (MODIS-VCF) to monitor the tree cover change in the Indian region over a period of 6\xc2\xa0years (2000\xe2\x80\x932005). Pixel-based linear regression model is developed to identify rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The regression parameters viz., slope, offset and variance are used to identify threshold between forest and non-forest classes. The classification algorithm resulted into change area, no change area, positive change and negative changes. MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using the field data and showed a coefficient of determination (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.85) between percent tree cover and individual plot wise canopy cover information. The results were overlaid with UNEP protected area boundary. On a long-term basis, the forest cover change was monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat and IRS) satellite data to identify the rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The developed approach is efficient and effective for regional monitoring of forest cover change. It could be automated for regular usage and monitoring.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn the last decade the demand of power in India has increased manifold, therefore Government has announced the National Solar Mission of generating 100\xc2\xa0GW of solar power up to 2022. Around 60% of the total National Solar Mission target is allotted to the national/international large-scale solar power developers/investors. Hence, it becomes important to know the ground reality of large-scale solar PV developers/investors. This paper deeply analyzes the key barriers and bottlenecks faced by solar power developers in achieving the target and their growth. This article also suggests some motivational factors of solar energy which play an important role in attracting large solar players around the world to invest in Indian subcontinent. It concludes by highlighting some key policies of the Government that can help in addressing some identified barriers in order to ensure a secured sustainable energy future of India.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Contributions of four major anthropogenic sectors to ambient PM2.5 in India examined.\xe2\x80\xa2Statistics at state level are provided.\xe2\x80\xa2Source-apportioned burden (in terms of premature deaths) is estimated.\xe2\x80\xa2Complete mitigation of transport, industrial and energy sectoral emission would save 92,380 premature deaths.\xe2\x80\xa2Complete mitigation of residential sector emission would save 378,295 lives.AbstractExposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the leading risk factors for the mortality and morbidity burden in India. Health benefit expected from mitigation of emissions from individual sectors is the key policy information to address this issue. Here we quantify the relative shares of four major year-round anthropogenic sources to ambient PM2.5 in India using a chemical transport model and estimate premature deaths that could have been avoided due to complete mitigation of emissions from these sources at state level. Population-weighted all-India averaged (\xc2\xb11\xcf\x83) annual ambient PM2.5 exposures due to residential, transport, industrial and energy sectors in 2010 are estimated to be 26.2\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf12.5, 3.8\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf4.3, 5.5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf2.7 and 2.2\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf2.3\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923, respectively. Complete mitigation of emissions from the transport, industrial and energy sectors combined would avoid 92,380 (95% uncertainty interval (UI), 40,918\xe2\x80\x93140,741) premature deaths annually, primarily at the urban hotspots. For the residential sector, this would result in avoiding 378,295 (95% UI, 175,002\xe2\x80\x93575,293) premature deaths due to a reduction in ambient PM2.5 exposure in addition to the benefit of avoiding all premature deaths from household exposure. Bihar and Goa are expected to have the largest (289) and smallest (48) premature mortality burden per 100,000 population due to anthropogenic PM2.5 exposure. From policy perspective, controlling residential sources should be prioritized in view of the effectiveness of implementing mitigation measures and the expected larger health benefit at a regional scale. However, additional mitigation measures are advised at the urban hotspots to curb emissions from the other sectors to get maximum possible health benefit.Graphical abstractNormalized frequency distribution of relative contributions of energy (Ene), industrial (Ind), transportation (Trans) and residential (Res) sources to annual ambient anthropogenic PM2.5 exposure over India.

Title: 'The occurrence of arboreal mammals in the rain forest fragments in the Anamalai Hills, south India'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe occurrence and abundance of five species of arboreal mammals in 25 rain forest fragments ranging from <1 ha to 2500 ha in area in the Anamalai Hills in south India, were examined in relation to several habitat and landscape variables. The lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) was the most affected, being absent from 15 fragments while the Nilgiri langur (Trachypithecus johnii) was absent from six and the Malabar giant squirrel (Ratufa indica) from only three fragments. The densities of the giant squirrel, the large brown flying squirrel (Petaurista petaurista) and the Travancore flying squirrel (Petinomys fuscocapillus) increased with decreasing area and increasing disturbance level. In logistic regression, canopy height and tree density were the best predictors of the occurrence of the lion-tailed macaque and the Nilgiri langur, respectively. Area of the fragment may be an important predictor of occurrence of these species only when the fragments are very small. Once initially present, their continued occurrence is better predicted by habitat variation, consistent with the ecology of the species. It is possible to retain the arboreal mammals in the rain forest fragments through improving habitat quality. The suggested measures include (a) prevention of degradation due to lopping and felling of trees; (b) assisted regeneration in forest fragments; and (c) retention of orchards of jack fruit trees (Artocarpus integrifolia), guava (Psidium guajava), etc., in the labour settlements around the fragments. Land use policies that would prevent conversion of cardamom plantations into tea or coffee plantations are also needed.'

Title: 'Coastal zones in integrated river basin management in the West Coast of India: Delineation, boundary issues and implications'
Author: 'K.G.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Coastal zones are seldom reckoned even in integrated river basin management regimes.\xe2\x80\xa2Indian west coast watersheds are delineated using multiple high resolution datasets.\xe2\x80\xa2Estuarine complexes and interconnections complicate coastal basin delineation.\xe2\x80\xa2Integrating coasts to basins is fraught with multiple boundary considerations.\xe2\x80\xa2Inclusion of the coast in basin regime is vital for valid upstream interventions.AbstractThe management of the coastal region, its resources and stakeholder rights are treated in isolation from the associated river basins in most of the countries across the world. Incorporating the coastal stretch as an integral part of the basin becomes necessary due to the reciprocal relationships that exist between the coastal \xe2\x80\x98tail-end\xe2\x80\x99 ecosystems and upstream stretches. The present study addresses the challenges involved in integrating the coastal zones into the Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) framework, especially in developing countries like India. As a part of this study, the river basins and their coastal watersheds in the west coast of India, a highly bio-diverse and densely populated region, is delineated using multiple high resolution datasets. A case study of one of the western coastal tracts is also attempted to identify the boundaries that have to be considered in the coastal zones for basin delineation. The ambiguities in the coastal drainage and floodplain boundaries due to the numerous cross-linkages that exist with the neighbouring estuaries, the multitude of small independent coastal catchments and asymmetries between surface and groundwater boundaries present difficulties in undertaking a strict hydrological delineation in the study region. Apart from these natural boundaries, various administrative/political units, coastal management frameworks, resource dependencies and livelihoods present additional boundary concerns for sustainable coastal management within IRBM. Taking these multiple boundaries of the coastal zone into account within the river basin regime becomes essential for resource sharing and legitimate interventions in upstream basin decisions that jeopardise the coastal ecosystem and livelihoods.'

This program aims to reinforce children's traditional knowledge and values around biological resources in Wayanad, India's Western Ghats, encouraging tribal and non-tribal children to learn from each other and from their own communities. Results show that the educational program has enhanced children's ability to identify selected wild food plants. Moreover, strong social stigma related to wild food plant gathering also appears to have been effectively countered, and the program seems to have created more self-confidence among the children about (a) the perceptions of others' social attitudes towards their gathering practices, and (b) the importance of these plants as part of their diets and cultures."

Institutional arrangements play a crucial role in ensuring equitable benefit sharing of tourism gains among different stakeholders. We examined this role of institutional arrangements in four National Parks of the Indian Western Himalaya at varying altitude through multiple case study analysis using qualitative methods. Our results suggest that a three-tier setup involving local communities and civil society organizations, supported by enabling government policies is most efficacious in mainstreaming socio-economic development of local communities and environmental concerns in tourism management framework. Strong local institutions with intrinsic spatial linkage are required to ensure maximum benefits to all sections of society and least monetary leakages. We recommend that in natural landscapes with conflicting interests among stakeholders, a hierarchical three-tier institutional arrangement should be encouraged to achieve the goals of sustainable tourism.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa264 water samples were collected out of which 37 water samples were having iron content beyond permissible limit of 300\xc2\xa0ppb.\xe2\x80\xa2The maximum iron content was found to be 6294\xc2\xa0ppb in Gangan river water near Fazalpur industrial area.\xe2\x80\xa2The local residents have given the feedback that either the water is yellow in colour as available or it turns yellow on storage.AbstractIn India, the district of Moradabad lies between 28\xc2\xb021\xe2\x80\xb2 to 28\xc2\xb016\xe2\x80\xb2 north latitude and 78\xc2\xb04\xe2\x80\xb2 to 79\xc2\xb0 east longitude in western Uttar Pradesh. The city is known for its export of brass handicrafts to various countries across the world including North America and Europe and is also known as Peetal Nagri (Brass City). A field survey was conducted in district Moradabad along with a public interaction program on water related problems. A total of 108 representative villages covering all eight blocks of Moradabad district were visited and interactions were held with the local population to find out the status of drinking water quality and associated problems. The previous studies on surface and groundwater quality assessment of Moradabad district did not cover the entire area or present the water quality awareness amongst the local population despite of the repeatedly complains about the yellow colour of water.Water quality of surface and groundwater has been assessed with respect to metal concentration using ICP-OES technique. Out of the 64 water samples collected, copper, arsenic, lead and chromium concentrations were always within the permissible limits. While iron concentration, more than 50% of the samples were beyond permissible limit. Maximum iron level in groundwater sample was 3820\xc2\xa0ppb and that in surface water sample was 6294\xc2\xa0ppb whereas the permissible limit is 300\xc2\xa0ppb.The overload of iron may cause severe health problems such as liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis of liver, diseases related to heart and central nervous system, infertility etc. The presence of high concentration of iron leads to adverse changes in colour, odour and taste of water and it also stains clothes and utensils. However, the local health authority's records are not available."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe fate of much of the world\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial biodiversity is linked to the management of human-modified forest landscapes in the humid tropics. This Special Issue presents the first pan-tropical synthesis of research on the prospects for biodiversity in such systems, with eight individual regional summaries covering Mesoamerica, Amazonia, Atlantic forest of South America, West Africa, Madagascar, Western Ghats, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Two additional papers compare the state of conservation science in tropical forests with both temperate forests and savannah systems. This overview paper provides a comparative analysis of the threats and opportunities facing tropical forest biodiversity, thereby helping to identify the most pressing areas of future research and region-specific factors that contribute towards the effectiveness of individual conservation initiatives. While many of the threats facing tropical forest biodiversity are commonplace they vary markedly in their relative importance across different regions. There is a critical lack of comparable data to understand scale dependent processes, or the relative importance of varying geographic and historical contexts in determining present-day patterns. Conservation science has a key role to play in safeguarding the future of tropical forest biodiversity, but needs to become more effectively embedded in the context of real-world conservation challenges and opportunities. Significant progress can be achieved by improving the cost-effectiveness of research as well as the exchange of ideas and data amongst scientists working in different, often isolated parts of the world. We hope this special issue goes some way top achieving this exchange of knowledge.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The hydroclimatic trend and variability of the Mahanadi basin is investigated.\xe2\x80\xa2Subseasonal and spatial difference in trends is observed.\xe2\x80\xa2Extreme indices show clear basin scale patterns.\xe2\x80\xa2The pre- and post-monsoon season experience upward trends.\xe2\x80\xa2Signal of an intensified interannual variability is observed.SummaryMahanadi River basin is one of the recognized climatic vulnerable regions of India. Recent occurrences of the extreme climatic events in this basin underscore the importance of evaluating the trend and variability of hydroclimatic variables in order to understand the potential impact of future change. In this study, the monthly streamflow data for the period 1972\xe2\x80\x932007 and the daily rainfall data for the period 1972\xe2\x80\x932005 have been analyzed using the Mann\xe2\x80\x93Kendall nonparametric test after removing serial correlation. The results reveal a substantial spatial and subseasonal difference in the monsoon season streamflow and rainfall patterns, with a predominance of the increasing trends in June and decreasing trends in August. However, a marked increase is observed in the streamflow and rainfall of the pre- and post-monsoon season. The correlation coefficients show a direct correspondence of the rainfall and streamflow series with the El Ni\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x93Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is contrary to the established inverse relationship over India. The noteworthy feature of this study is the observed climate uncertainty in terms of large variability in the extreme indices since the 1990s, consistent with the warming induced intensification of the hydrological cycle. Strong evidences have emerged regarding the basin-wide increases in extreme rainfall indices. In particular, the coastal sector of the basin is more vulnerable to the heavy rainfall, whereas the southern Eastern Ghats region is susceptible to the moisture stress. The discharge at the basin outlet has declined at a rate of 3388\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106\xc2\xa0m3\xc2\xa0decade\xe2\x88\x921, suggesting the need of environmental flow assessment. The results of this study would help the reservoir managers and policy makers in planning and management of water resources of the Mahanadi River basin.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis study provides an historical perspective on everyday experiences of weather and climate, through an analysis of the diaries of two colonial figures in Bombay, western India, in the 1820s: Mountstuart Elphinstone (the then Governor) and Lucretia West (the wife of the Chief Justice). The paper explores the ways in which climate impacted upon their daily routine and health, and discusses evidence for the influence of wider climatic narratives within their writings. Climate played a dominant and complex role within colonial discourse, providing both a barrier to colonisation, and a justification for European governance over populations that had become \xe2\x80\x98degenerate\xe2\x80\x99 through their exposure to tropical climates. Both of the diaries evidence this influence of climate within the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 daily lives, but demonstrate the differing responses to climate based on the two diarists\xe2\x80\x99 social positions. Mountstuart Elphinstone, in particular, had a strong sense of the impact of climate upon his health, in keeping with contemporary medical beliefs equating climate with physical wellbeing. The paper provides evidence of the evolution of acclimatisation discourse during the early nineteenth century, and suggests that European beliefs concerning tropical climates were changing simultaneously within both the medical establishment and the wider colonial community. The paper also explores the medical excursions that the diarists took to towns in the Western Ghats. It is apparent that their experiences of the climate in such towns were influenced by their prior expectations, a theme which resonates with discourses of climate in our own times.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba A study of acclimatisation discourse, within two diaries from colonial Bombay 1819\xe2\x80\x931828. \xe2\x96\xba Dominant role of weather in the lives of the colonists demonstrated. \xe2\x96\xba Evidence of shift in acclimatisation discourse during the early nineteenth century. \xe2\x96\xba Provides early evidence of colonial cultural attitudes towards Hill Stations. \xe2\x96\xba Universalities in experiences of climate are suggested.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Kerala\xe2\x80\x99s agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium in a changing landscape.\xe2\x80\xa2Despite rapid rural development, homegarden agriculture remains widespread.\xe2\x80\xa2However, crop production in species-rich homegardens is declining.\xe2\x80\xa2Agricultural land-use studies in the tropics benefit from mixed-methods approaches.AbstractDespite the availability of a wide range of tools, measuring and explaining changes in land cover and land use in tropical regions can be extremely challenging. Kerala, India, is a biodiversity hotspot with a high population density and a long history of complex agricultural land-use patterns. Some reports suggest that agriculture in Kerala, which historically is rice paddy-wetland and agroforestry-based, is on the decline. However, the evidence is often anecdotal, especially with regards to smallholding homegarden agriculture. In this study we employ mixed methods, including remote sensing, quantitative household surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to unravel the complex land-cover and land-use changes occurring in Kerala.Results indicate that, from a land-cover change perspective, agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium with other land covers, being cleared for roads and new buildings, but offset by the expansion of younger, less diverse agroforests into paddy wetlands. Yet beneath the canopy, agroforests are undergoing rapid land-use change not discernible using remote sensing. These changes include a reported decrease in the cultivation of 80% of Kerala\xe2\x80\x99s primary crop species during 2003\xe2\x80\x932013, alongside a dramatic decline in chickens (from 12.5 to 2.6 per homestead on average) and cows (from 1.7 to 0.8). Over this period, no crop increased in cultivation. According to farmers, the primary drivers of this shift were declining profitability of agriculture in Kerala, labour shortages, unreliable weather, unfamiliar pests and diseases, and government policy.Despite the undeniable move away from agricultural activity in homegardens, we conclude that these ecologically and culturally important systems are not disappearing, but rather evolving to meet the needs of a less agricultural Kerala. Our research highlights the value of using mixed methods for characterizing land-use and land-cover histories in tropical regions.'

Title: 'Progressing towards the development of sustainable energy: A critical review on the current status, applications, developmental barriers and prospects of solar photovoltaic systems in India'

Abstract: "AbstractEquality between economic progress and environmental sustainability is essential for a developing country like India. In the present time, the economy of India is growing rapidly in a vibrant mode and an efficient way, which in turn demands huge uninterrupted energy supplies. The country's energy needs are met mostly by the usage of fossil fuels and nearly 70% of electricity is generated from coal based power plants. In India, nearly 840 million people depend on traditional biomass to satisfy their energy necessities. Approximately 74 million rural people do not have access to modern lighting systems and around 81 million households do not have access to electricity, which is a major challenge to India's energy security. In order to achieve stable sustainable energy in the long-run, significant progress in renewable energy sectors is needed. Favorably, due to India's geographic location, the country is blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, which has not yet been exploited completely. So the central and state governments of the country have framed various policies and are providing subsidies to encourage the utilization of solar photovoltaic systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential, current developmental status and prospects of solar energy of India is briefed. The various applications of solar energy such as water heaters, desalination units, pasteurizers, food drying units, water purifier, space heating systems, air-conditioning units, cookers, water pumps, aerators, solar-wind hybrid systems and grid connected photovoltaic systems are explained. The study also mentions the current renewable energy policies, the barriers blocking the progress of the solar manufacturing units and some possible future recommendations that might speed up renewable energy developments in India."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Long-term land alteration in the Tamiraparani sub-basin is studied.\xe2\x80\xa2Six landuse classes were classified.\xe2\x80\xa2Kappa coefficients indicate acceptable accuracy.\xe2\x80\xa2Human and climate induced factors are responsible for land alteration.AbstractThe present study emphasizes the long-term (1992\xe2\x80\x932012) land alteration and its driving factors in the Tamiraparani sub-basin, south India. The multi-temporal landuse/land cover features were extracted from the Landsat images (TM and ETM+, 30\xc2\xa0m resolution) using a supervised classification technique with maximum likelihood classifier. The extracted features were classified into various landuse/ land cover categories with level I classification scheme of NRSC, India. Six major landuse classes such as forest, settlement, barren land, water bodies, agricultural land and fallow land were recognized. The overall accuracy for the year 1992, 2002, and 2012 shows 85.55%, 82.81% and 83.59% respectively. The overall Kappa coefficients for the datasets are near to 0.8, which indicates acceptable accuracy for landuse/ land cover classification. The results reveals that the spatial extent of forest, settlement and barren land has evolved in the past 20 years but, the water bodies, agricultural land and fallow land has reduced significantly. The reduction in agricultural land in the study area for the past 20 years is due to the combination of natural environment and socio-economic factors such as low rainfall in the plains, increased surface temperature, reduced soil moisture condition, high rate of evapo-transpiration, reduced water storage level in the reservoirs and ponds, and reduced vegetation cover. These factors are linked with climate change, it alters the socio-economic condition of the area, and such situation will affect the overall ecosystem in the Tamiraparani sub-basin in the near future.'

Conventional suppression methods were shown to be highly effective when appropriately deployed.AbstractThis reviews work published since 2007. Relative efforts devoted to the agents of African trypanosomiasis and their tsetse fly vectors are given by the numbers of PubMed accessions. In the last 10 years PubMed citations number 3457 for Trypanosoma brucei and 769 for Glossina. The development of simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms afford much higher resolution of Glossina and Trypanosoma population structures than heretofore. Even greater resolution is offered by partial and whole genome sequencing. Reproduction in T. brucei sensu lato is principally clonal although genetic recombination in tsetse salivary glands has been demonstrated in T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense but not in T. b. gambiense.In the past decade most genetic attention was given to the chief human African trypanosomiasis vectors in subgenus Nemorhina e.g., Glossina f. fuscipes, G. p. palpalis, and G. p. gambiense. The chief interest in Nemorhina population genetics seemed to be finding vector populations sufficiently isolated to enable efficient and long-lasting suppression. To this end estimates were made of gene flow, derived from FST and its analogues, and Ne, the size of a hypothetical population equivalent to that under study. Genetic drift was greater, gene flow and Ne typically lesser in savannah inhabiting tsetse (subgenus Glossina) than in riverine forms (Nemorhina). Population stabilities were examined by sequential sampling and genotypic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in both groups and found to be stable. Gene frequencies estimated in sequential samplings differed by drift and allowed estimates of effective population numbers that were greater for Nemorhina spp than Glossina spp.Prospects are examined of genetic methods of vector control. The tsetse long generation time (c. 50 d) is a major contraindication to any suggested genetic method of tsetse population manipulation. Ecological and modelling research convincingly show that conventional methods of targeted insecticide applications and traps/targets can achieve cost-effective reduction in tsetse densities.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUrban planning is a tool, which enables in managing changes within a spatial approach. It helps in conducting planning activities where the economic, environmental, and social goals are taken care of holistically. Planning process involves studying past trends, learning from past and present, and then preparing a proposal for future. This process mostly assesses the trend of growth and plans for development. A trend follows change in a defined rate. An indefinite or unexpected change spoils the planning process, by breaking the trend of growth. City is known for its resources, geography, population, social-culture structure, economy etc. Whenever there is an unexpected change in any of these parameters, the city undergoes remarkable changes. Disaster also brings hasty changes in all these, which is indeed a challenge to urban planning and design. The fast modernization and adoption of western culture leads to significant changes in socio-cultural and economic spheres. City also changes, when rapid movement of people and resources occur. Tourism industry in this decade brought many changes is Indian cities. It diversifies social and cultural identity of the city and generates tremendous opportunity for economic development. Therefore cities having tourism potential are facing urban planning problems. Exploring these issues and reasons behind it will be helpful to minimize its impact. Tourism cities have tremendous potential of research in this direction. The need of the decade for urban planners and designers is to be prepared for the changes in a tourist city.'

In this study, first spatially explicit mapping of SOC and SIC at 250\xc2\xa0m resolution and an estimate of their pool size in India was undertaken using a large number of remote sensing derived data layers and data mining approach. The SOC and SIC densities up to 100\xc2\xa0cm depth or paralithic contact (whichever is shallower) were estimated for 1198 soil samples located across India using a stratified random sampling that integrated land use, soil, topography and agro-ecological regions.Using Random forests (RF) based spatial prediction procedure with climatic, land cover, rock type, soil type, multi-year NDVI, irrigation status as independent input variables, models for predicting carbon density at 250\xc2\xa0m spatial resolution were developed. For modelling with RF algorithm, about 898 soil profile observations (75% observations) were used, while the rest of 300 (25% of total observations) were used for validation. It was observed that the data distribution of sample points don't have significant influence on RF model predictions. The relationship between observed and predicted values was characterized by Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) parameters. The SOC, SIC and total soil carbon pool size of India has been estimated at 22.72\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.93 Pg,12.83\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.35 Pg and 35.55\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.87 Pg, respectively, which are comparable to previous studies while providing first spatially explicit 250\xc2\xa0m map of their distribution. The spatial distribution indicates that majority of the carbon stock resides in the northern part of India. The soil carbon stock of eastern India has contribution from organic carbon, while the western portion has contribution mainly from inorganic carbon."

Abstract: 'AbstractLand use and land cover changes play an important role in the occurrence of vector-borne diseases. It is highly essential to identify the prominent changes responsible for its occurrence so that suitable measures can be adopted. An attempt was made to identify the prominent land use and land cover changes responsible for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue fever in the State of Kerala, India, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple regression analysis. Large extent of water bodies, low land and agricultural land played a significant role on the incidence of chikungunya and malaria. High population density, built-up area and agricultural area favoured dengue fever. Vector-borne diseases were found to be the lowest in places where there is no low land and with higher forest area. Inappropriate disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area might be the reason for the spread of dengue fever. Freshwater in drains of these areas is polluted and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Hence much attention is to be paid to provide appropriate treatment and disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area of the State In an evolving urban policy, priority is to be given to the installation of safe treatment and disposal facility of wastes especially, sewage, sullage, and solid waste. The protection of forest land also plays an important role. Economic policy instruments such as Payment for Environment Services (PES) schemes, may constitute a useful tool to encourage an improved land use management through appropriate price signals, such as, for instance, for the preservation of forested areas especially in proximity of highly populated urban environments.'

It also addresses some of the shortcomings identified in existing literature by estimating the value of several intangible benefits, and disservices of forests ignored in most valuation studies, as well as the added value from intact forests as compared to from alternative landscapes. Using primary and secondary data, and economic valuation techniques the study shows that the total net benefits provided by the Nagarhole national park in Karnataka, India are considerable. The added value of benefits from the park is also higher as compared to from alternative landscapes considering just three ecosystem services. If these are factored in decision making it could strengthen the economic case for conserving forests in tropical countries such as India where there is immense pressure to divert forests for meeting development needs.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn an era of human activities, global environmental changes, habitat loss and species extinction, conservation strategies are a crucial step toward minimizing biodiversity loss. For instance, oceans acidification and land use are intensifying in many places with negative and often irreversible consequences for biodiversity. Biodiversity hotspots, despite some criticism, have become a tool for setting conservation priorities and play an important role in decision-making for cost-effective strategies to preserve biodiversity in terrestrial and, to some extent, marine ecosystems. This area-based approach can be applied to any geographical scale and it is considered to be one of the best approaches for maintaining a large proportion of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biological diversity. However, delineating hotspots includes quantitative criteria along with subjective considerations and the risk is to neglect areas, such as coldspots, with other types of conservation value. Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that biodiversity is much more than just the number of species in a region and a conservation strategy cannot be based merely on the number of taxa present in an ecosystem. Therefore, the idea that strongly emerges is the need to reconsider conservation priorities and to go toward an interdisciplinary approach through the creation of science-policy partnerships.'

Given the economic importance of these areas from time immemorial, the local people took special care to protect and sustainably utilize these common property resources. However, these forests and rangelands have suffered severe degradation in the recent past. Rehabilitation of Orans and Gauchars needs proper planning and execution of a technically feasible package, tailored to suit their unique edaphic, climatic, vegetation, social and legal status. Keeping in view the vast potential of these areas to sustain large scale livestock farming for overall economic upliftment of the local population, there is an urgent need to rehabilitate these degraded areas in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Understanding the challenges of developing a groundwater governance framework for regions of extensive groundwater development versus relatively less-developed areas of groundwater development is important.

The present study attempts to identify the environmental sensitivity to the oil spill of Karnataka coast by using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Nearly 300\xc2\xa0km long coastline of Karnataka is endowed with a vast variety of natural resources and aesthetics. Several of the rivers that originate in the Western Ghats form wide extensive estuaries, backwaters and mangrove forests before debouching into the Arabian Sea. Besides, several non-vegetal wetlands like beaches, spits, shoals, mudflats, rocky cliffs and a few islands are found scattered all along the coast. A major port (New Mangalore Port), ten minor ports and a naval base (near Karwar) are also situated in the study area. As a result, various ESI types namely: 1A, 1B, 3A, 4, 6B, 8B, 9B, 10A, 10B and 10D were noticed in the study area.

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2In the last 10\xc2\xa0years the numbers of protected areas (PA) and unprotected amphibian species have increased.\xe2\x80\xa2This paradox led to a quarter of living amphibians totally unrepresented in the global network of PAs.\xe2\x80\xa265% of unprotected amphibians live in human-dominated landscapes.\xe2\x80\xa2Most unprotected amphibian species are currently classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN.AbstractAmphibians are undergoing a global conservation crisis, and they are one of the most underrepresented groups of vertebrates in the global network of protected areas (PAs). In this study, we evaluated the ability of the world's PAs to represent extant amphibian species. We also estimated the magnitude of the human footprint along the geographic distributions of gap species (i.e., those with distributions totally outside PAs). Twenty-four percent of species (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01535) are totally unrepresented, and another 18% (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01119) have less than 5% of their distribution inside PAs. Nearly half of all species with ranges under 1000\xc2\xa0km2 do not occur inside any PA. Furthermore, more than 65% of the distribution of gap species is in human-dominated landscapes. Although the Earth's PAs have greatly increased during the last ten years, the number of unprotected amphibians has also grown. Tropical countries in particular should strongly consider (1) the importance of using amphibians to drive conservation policies that eventually lead to the implementation and management of PAs, given amphibians' extinction risk and ability to act as bioindicators; (2) the effectiveness of national recovery plans for threatened amphibian species; and (3) the need for increased funding for scientific research to expand our knowledge of amphibian species. Meanwhile, data-deficient amphibian species should receive a higher priority than they usually receive in conservation planning, as a precautionary measure. Throughout this paper, we point out several challenges in creating more comprehensive amphibian conservation strategies and opportunities in the next decade."

The concept of system transition is described as a continuum between forests and highly intensive agriculture via different grades of intensification where profit differential is identified as the system transition pressure. In order to operationalise the concept, the article develops land use suitability, input use intensity and farming system diversity indices which are calculated for different agricultural cropping systems in the selected states of India. The results show the apparent decline in land use suitability, reduction in farming system diversity, increase of cultivation intensity, reflecting a reduction in planned and associated agro-biodiversity. The results also show increasing transition pressure to shift from low intensive and high diverse systems to high intensive low diverse systems that represent increasing opportunity cost of conservation of the former systems. A set of policy measures to deflate the transition pressure that can at least retain a threshold of traditional high diversity systems are briefly discussed. The study also outlines further research directions.'

Title: 'ViewpointReflections on the authorship of space technology'

Abstract: "AbstractThe paper offers a proposition in which the notion of the 'ownership' of outer space is substituted for that of 'authorship'. The notion of authorship draws attention to the processes of critical thinking, re-contextualization and resistances to space technology that take place in social domains where no clear role exists either as audience or user of space technology. The proposition responds in part to interventions made by artists in recent years into the workplaces of space technologists and, incrementally, into the imaginaries that inform the kinds of activities that happen in space. Artistic processes expose the reception of space technology at an intimate scale where the agencies of the viewer to observe, absorb and rethink converge with the shaping of space technology via state mediation and space agency imperatives. The constituency of collective authorship to which space technologies are subject is revealed in unexpected ways through artistic intervention that suggests a reappraisal of some of the terms of reference guiding space policy."

Abstract: 'AbstractAn optimal operation plan has been developed for the reservoirs in Kuttiadi river basin in Kerala using systems approach. A system consists of three reservoirs namely; Banasurasagar in Wayanad district,Kakkayam and Peruvannamuzhi in Kozhikode district has been taken for the study. Banasurasagar reservoir is in Kabbini river basin, which is an east flowing river and the remaining two are in Kuttiadi river basin, which is a west flowing river. They serve different purposes such as irrigation, domestic water supply and hydropower generation. These purposes were fulfilled based on the Standard Linear Operation Policy (SLOP) developed during the early stages of project formulation. Considering the deficit of water in the region, a system study has been done using multi-reservoir multi-purpose simulation technique, in which reservoir rule curve- based policy to optimally utilize the conservation storage of these three reservoirs have been developed. The generalised simulation model developed at the National Institute of Hydrology has been used to derive the rule levels and simulation of the system. The simulation studies reveal that the Banasurasagar reservoir and Peruvannamuzhi reservoir always serve the purposes of water supply without fail. For Banasurasagar reservoir, irrigation and water supply reliability is found to be 86% where as for Peruvanannamuzhi reservoir, it is 77%. The demand for power generation can be met with 90% dependability. Reservoir linked water supply can be thought of from Banasurasagar reservoir to Wayanad district like water supply from Peruvannamuzhi reservoir to Kozhikode district.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x98Watershed services\xe2\x80\x99 provided by forest ecosystems are receiving increasing attention in the research and policy arena. Changes in forest cover in tropical regions take many different forms and result in multi-dimensional changes in watershed processes: soil erosion rates, peak and low-flow levels, groundwater recharge rates, and water quality. These changes are in turn mediated by the socio-technical context to create a variety of context-specific human impacts, which constitute watershed \xe2\x80\x98services\xe2\x80\x99 (or \xe2\x80\x98dis-services\xe2\x80\x99). Over the past decade, understanding of the biophysical linkage has generally become nuanced. But large gaps remain in regions like south Asia and Africa and on the question of how different types of forest transitions affect low flows, and the socio-hydrological links are inadequately studied. Economic valuation studies are still plagued with conceptual errors, oversimplified biophysical models, lack of social and technological context, and focus on lump-sum numbers. Greater integration of concepts, methods and latest results, and attention to context-specificity, are required for generating policy-relevant insights.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper describes work in progress by the authors to explore the extent and characteristics of homelessness in developing countries including an assessment of the viability of and need for a globally acceptable definition of homelessness. Its main aim is to provide an empirical context from developing countries against which the current theoretical concepts of home, and existing typologies on homelessness, may be examined. This is important because it is becoming evident that a single definition may be inappropriate and that a range of definitions may be needed to underpin interventions and policy development.'

These two stressors are likely to interact, but how climate change will mediate the effects of land-cover change remains poorly understood. Here we use an empirically-derived model of the interaction between habitat loss and climate to predict the implications of this for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities at a global scale. Risk analysis was used to estimate the risk of biodiversity loss due to alternative future land-cover change scenarios and to quantify how climate change mediates this risk. We demonstrate that the interaction of climate change with land-cover change could increase the impact of land-cover change on birds and mammals by up to 43% and 24% respectively and alter the spatial distribution of threats. Additionally, we show that the ranking of global biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction between climate change and habitat loss. Our study suggests that the investment of conservation resources will likely change once the interaction between climate change and land-cover change is taken into account. We argue that global conservation efforts must take this into account if we are to develop cost-effective conservation policies and strategies under global change.'

Abstract: 'AbstractComplex multistrata agroforestry systems (CMSAFs) are tree-dominated land use systems with two or more strata of trees or shrubs and a substantial degree of structural complexity within at least one of the strata. They cover several million hectares in the tropics. This article distinguishes: (1) CMSAF based on understorey tree crops; (2) CMSAF based on overstorey tree crops; (3) intensively managed mixed systems such as homegardens; and (4) forest-enrichment systems. It discusses their ecology, distribution, dynamics, environmental functions, productivity, and possibilities for improvement of their profitability. In view of current pressures to intensify tropical land use systems, CMSAF have the best prospects to remain part of the landscape in areas where there are specific government policies for conserving them, such as in inhabited protected areas.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis chapter analyzes the spatial and temporal patterns of rice production and productivity in India. Of the 20 agroecological zones, five account for more than 60% of the total rice area and these zones unfortunately house a large number of low-productivity districts. Most of these low-productivity districts fall under the rainfed rice ecosystem that seems to lack appropriate production technologies. Average total factor productivity (TFP) growth for rice was estimated at 3.28% from 1991\xe2\x80\x9392 to 2012\xe2\x80\x9313, and much of this growth was contributed by technical change with little improvement in technical efficiency change. Among the states, Punjab registered the highest TFP growth of 5.71%, whereas Assam showed a negative growth rate. With the exception of Andhra Pradesh, all states failed to show technical efficiency gains, meaning higher quantities of rice are produced using a higher quantity of input per hectare. Overall, analysis revealed that technical change was the main driver of TFP growth in rice.'

Abstract: 'AbstractCoffee-farming units of India, with their strong orientation to export markets, have in the WTO era, displayed a high propensity for compliance with trade-facilitating environmental norms arising from sanitary and phytosanitary measures. But thee farming units seek to recoup incremental costs arising from compliance with these norms through unsustainable exploitation of their biodiversity wealth. Based on this unique case of conflict between WTO-related environmental standards and biodiversity concerns, the paper advocates integration of national and global environmental concerns with trade-related environmental regulations in the larger interests of sustainable agriculture in developing countries.'

The lives, livelihoods and rights over resources of the inhabitants of these spaces are transforming in complex ways that result in nascent conflicts, coerced/ill-informed consents and new forms of inequities in the absence of a strong, decentralised resource governance system. This paper is a viewpoint on these processes at work in the peri-urban villages in the context of growing urbanisation in India. The present governance structure of the villages are observed to be ill-equipped to deal with the growing resource competition and rapid changes that result when a village becomes a peri-urban space.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe relocation and resettlement of people from nature reserves is a controversial issue in the conservation community. The perceived poor success rate of resettlement efforts, combined with availability of few well-documented studies, warrants a detailed examination of this issue. I have analyzed a relocation and resettlement project in India\xe2\x80\x99s Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. I examine the relocation experience of 419 households who moved to two villages located outside the reserve. I interviewed 61% of relocated households in 2002 and 55% relocated households in 2006. In 2002, 71% of households were satisfied with the relocation effort and their quality of life. In 2006, 52% of households were satisfied with their quality of life. Four years after relocation, all households have access to electricity, water, schools, health care, transportation, and communication facilities. Many households have increased their income and assets. Yet, there were differences between the two different-resettlement villages, with one of them faring better in terms of economics, hardships, and uncertainty. This paper draws out insights important for improving conservation practices related to resettlement efforts. It documents short to mid-term successes and challenges that affect the communities involved. I submit that in specific contexts, relocation may be a viable conservation tool. Successful conservation resettlement requires substantial financial support to meet people\xe2\x80\x99s socio-economic needs, active consultation of the people involved, and partnerships of committed non-governmental and governmental organizations.'

We report the estimates of forest carbon pool and its spatial distribution in the Indian forests for the years 1994 and 2010 at 5\xc2\xa0km grid level. This study improves upon earlier spatial estimates of Indian forest biomass carbon by using data from a robustly designed National Forest Inventory (NFI). The realized sampling intensity has addressed the large heterogeneity of the Indian forest types and allowed the computation of 5\xc2\xa0km grid level forest C, yielding a realistic estimate of forest biomass C in Indian forests. Forest cover density maps were intersected with 5\xc2\xa0km mesh and estimates of forest area, forest carbon density for each Agro-ecological sub region and forest carbon pools were linked to the 5\xc2\xa0km grid coverage of India. National forest carbon estimates for the years 1994 and 2010 are 3911.78 and 4368.03\xc2\xa0TgC respectively, and these estimates showed a net increase of 456.25\xc2\xa0TgC in 16\xc2\xa0years.

C densities for dense and open forest in 1994 estimated as 77.08 and 38.47\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 with total C pools of 2895.28\xc2\xa0TgC and 1016.50\xc2\xa0TgC which has increased to 80.24\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 41.69\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 with total C pools of 3176.48\xc2\xa0TgC and 1191.55\xc2\xa0TgC in 2010. This study provides the first 5\xc2\xa0km level C analysis for Indian forests. Spatial distribution of C shows large differences in C density over Indian forests indicating that estimates of the spatial distribution of C are even more important than the total C pool estimates of the country.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (355KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Do developmental initiatives influence local attitudes toward conservation? A case study from the Kalakad\xe2\x80\x93Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, India'

Abstract: "AbstractWe evaluated the conservation attitudes of the local villagers living adjacent to the Kalakad\xe2\x80\x93Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in southern India 6 years after implementation of a World Bank funded eco-development project. We assessed attitudes towards three facets of conservation: the tiger, an emblematic species signifying India's commitment to wildlife conservation; the forest, a principle source of fuel-wood and other products; and the Forest Department, which manages the forest. More specifically we predicted that (i) attitudes would be an effective predictor of resource use interest in the forest and (ii) benefits obtained from the EDP would create more favorable attitudes towards conservation and the protected area employees. Twelve villages located within 3\xc2\xa0km from the reserve boundary were chosen and 2\xe2\x80\x933% of the households interviewed with regard to their attitudes towards these three facets of conservation, their household resource use patterns, wealth, sex, age and length of residency. We found significant associations between wealth, sex, age and both tiger and forest conservation. Providing benefits has not changed the underlying attitudes of the communities. The poorer sections of society, whether receiving benefits or not, tended to support tiger conservation because conserving wildlife did not affect their livelihood in any way, whereas both the rich and poor had misgivings about forest conservation due to dependency on forest products. We conclude that the eco-development project has not effectively addressed the most important of the local concerns."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe term \xe2\x80\x98degraded land\xe2\x80\x99 is subjective and depends on the perspective of the observer. Foresters may view land as degraded when, in the view of the people who \xe2\x80\x98degraded\xe2\x80\x99 it, it has, for the first time, a value. While, for most people the term \xe2\x80\x98degraded land\xe2\x80\x99 unarguably includes land, possibly previously covered in trees, that has been mined and left devoid of all topsoil, all vegetation and any hope of regeneration in the medium term. The term is also held to include land that historically carried trees but which was cleared in the past and having no current alternative use, and has become apparently stable under some form of heath vegetation. In that state it may be valued for other reasons. Degraded land is sometimes held to include previously forested land that is in the process of being changed to other uses but may, currently, still contain remnants of forest. The purpose of this paper is to pose the question as to whether putting trees back on all types of degraded land is always the best decision when factors such as the economics of the operation; the social desirability of the operation and the ecological sustainability of it are considered and to highlight some of the issues a forester needs to consider before embarking on reafforestation of such land. Two examples are used\xe2\x80\x94one from the North Auckland region of New Zealand, the other from the Western Ghats region of India. The New Zealand example shows that both the direct and maintenance costs of afforesting degraded land can be greater than those for afforesting better land and when the private sector is the major player in afforestation, degraded land will not be taken up for planting, however desirable that might be for other reasons. The Indian example demonstrates that land which appears to be degraded might, in fact, be important to someone\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood and the political support for afforestation can be lost unless that implicit right is recognised.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSolar hotspots are the regions characterized by an exceptional solar power potential suitable for decentralized commercial exploitation of energy. Identification of solar hotspots in a vast geographical expanse with dense habitations helps to meet escalating power demand in a decentralized, efficient and sustainable manner. This communication focuses on the assessment of resource potential with variability in India derived from high resolution satellite derived insolation data. Data analysis reveals that nearly 58% of the geographical area potentially represent the solar hotspots in the country with more than 5\xc2\xa0kWh/m2/day of annual average Global insolation. A techno-economic analysis of the solar power technologies and a prospective minimal utilization of the land available within these solar hotspots demonstrate their immense power generation as well as emission reduction potential. The study evaluates the progress made in solar power generation in the country especially with the inception of an ambitious National Solar Mission (NSM) also termed as \xe2\x80\x98Solar India\xe2\x80\x99. The organizational aspects of solar power generation with focus on existing policy elements are also addressed so as to probe the actual potential of the identified solar hotspots in meeting the NSM targets and beyond.'

Abstract: 'AbstractKochi is a rapidly growing commercial, industrial and trading centre of Kerala. Due to the tremendous growth and urbanization, the density of population in city is increasing every year. These factors have resulted in land use stresses, reducing open areas especially wetlands [1] in Kochi city for the past decades through land reclamation and encroachments. Again, anthropogenic activities like industrialisation, improper management of sewage and other solid waste lead to degradation of these ecosystems. This study discusses about the unique status of wetlands of Kadamakudypanchayat of Kochi with its Pokkali fields [2], fish farms. It also tries to propose guidelines, strategies and action plan at site specific level for development, conserving its wetlands along with its wise use in an ecological perspective keeping in mind the rapid urbanisation.'

Abstract: "AbstractFires, set by humans, have both positive and negative outcomes. Throughout India, this practice has been followed for thousands of years, thereby shaping the Indian landscape over the years. This chapter describes the many reasons, as far as they are now known, why people in India set fire to the landscape, and to what extent these fires are hazardous. Review shows that large destructive fires are infrequent in India, most being low-intensity fires that burn only the ground vegetation in their respective ecosystems. Over the years, fires have had a strong impact on ecosystems and their functioning. A\xc2\xa0study of the different reasons why people burn forests reveals one and perhaps the most important reason is that fire is essential for people's livelihood. This chapter also highlights that the way in which fire is used and its role in managing segments of the landscape are not in accordance with the current forest fire policy. We suggest a more flexible approach that allows for the inclusion of fire as a tool in local fire management systems."

Assessment of soil erosion is useful in planning and conservation works in a watershed or basin. Modelling can provide a quantitative and consistent approach to estimate soil erosion and sediment yield under a wide range of conditions. In the present study, the soil loss model, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with GIS has been used to estimate soil loss in the Nethravathi Basin located in the southwestern part of India. The Nethravathi Basin is a tropical coastal humid area having a drainage area of 3128\xc2\xa0km2 up to the gauging station. The parameters of RUSLE model were estimated using remote sensing data and the erosion probability zones were determined using GIS. The estimated rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topographic and crop management factors range from 2948.16 to 4711.4\xc2\xa0MJ/mm\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921hr\xe2\x88\x921/year, 0.10 to 0.44\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7MJ\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7mm\xe2\x88\x921, 0 to 92,774 and 0 to 0.63 respectively. The results indicate that the estimated total annual potential soil loss of about 473,339\xc2\xa0t/yr is comparable with the measured sediment of 441,870\xc2\xa0t/yr during the water year 2002\xe2\x80\x932003. The predicted soil erosion rate due to increase in agricultural area is about 14,673.5\xc2\xa0t/yr. The probability zone map has been derived by the weighted overlay index method indicate that the major portion of the study area comes under low probability zone and only a small portion comes under high and very high probability zone. The results can certainly aid in implementation of soil management and conservation practices to reduce the soil erosion in the Nethravathi Basin.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to identify optimum solar farm sites.\xe2\x80\xa2The methodology analyses 9 evaluation criteria and 11 exclusion zones to assess suitability.\xe2\x80\xa2Sensitivity analysis is performed to test the robustness of the model.\xe2\x80\xa2Best sites identified for solar farms are located in the northern region of Mauritius.AbstractDetermining economically viable and highly efficient strategic locations for utility-scale solar power plants is a costly procedure that depends on several factors. This paper investigates the spatial suitability for installations of ground-mounted solar farms based on legal, social, technical, economic, environmental and cultural perspectives through the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis combined with Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. A set of six exclusion criteria are identified and removed from the map layer considered exploitable for construction. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then used to determine the weights of nine selected evaluation criteria found to influence the placements of the farms. Proximity raster layers were derived from features including road network and high transmission lines, overlain with a 10\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x80\xaf\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\xaf10\xe2\x80\xafm raster terrain layers which includes elevation, slope and aspect and finally combined with interpolated raster dataset of climatological parameters comprising of global solar radiation, sunshine duration, air temperature and relative humidity. This combinatorial process through the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) technique generated a high resolution solar resource potential atlas classifying regions on the island from high to low potential for solar farm placement. Further analysis of highly suitable sites with aerial images of the localities of interest resulted in the identification of 3 best sites all situated in the northern plains of the island. The approach demonstrated is expected to help reduce time, money and resources presently allocated towards identifying and assessing hot spots for the construction of solar power plants in Mauritius.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe coastal landuse and land cover features in the South West coast of Kanyakumari are dynamically regulated due to marine and terrestrial processes and often controlling by natural and anthropogenic activities. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the decadal changes and their transformations of landuse and land cover (LULC) features under Level II category of USGS-LULC Classification System using Landsat ETM+ and TM images using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm for the period 2000\xe2\x80\x932011. The classified LULC features are categorized as beachface land cover, cultivable lands, plantation and shrub vegetation, fallow land, barren land, settlements and built-ups, water bodies, and mining area, etc. The geo-database is prepared for LULC feature class with an attributes of name, location, area and spatial distribution, etc. It shows the larger area in beachface land cover (sandy beaches, foredunes, uplands, Teri dunes (laterite) and associated nearshore landforms), plantations, cultivable lands, fallows, and barren lands are converted into built-ups and it increases more than twice in the period of 10\xc2\xa0years. Using GIS techniques, the analysis of change detection matrix reveals that the total area of 45.90\xc2\xa0km2 in different LULC features periodically shifted or transformed from one state to another one or more states, i.e. the beachface land cover area of 1.24\xc2\xa0km2 is encroached for built-ups and 0.63\xc2\xa0km2 for placer mining during the decade. Meanwhile, the area of 0.21\xc2\xa0km2 in this cover is transformed into wetlands and saltwater bodies. During the past decade, the expansion of area in the built-ups and settlements are directly proportional to the growth of population, which produces severe threat to the coastal resources. Accuracy assessment of classified images shows the overall accuracy is estimated as 81.16% and 77.52% and overall Kappa coeffient statistical values of 0.83 and 0.76 for the year 2000 and 2011 respectively. Ground truth verification of the extracted LULC features performed using 120 samples (10 samples per class) reveals that the accuracy of classified features is 89%. This indicates the acceptable accuracy of the classified LULC features for landuse and land cover change studies. The geodatabase of LULC features is used as primary source for sustainable land resource management in the coastal region.'

The environmental impacts were investigated with a cradle to gate perspective; using, raw materials extraction, manufacture, use, and supply of inputs to the farm. The functional units considered were one tonne of arecanut production (mass-based) and 1-ha area of arecanut (land-based). The data envelopment analysis indicated the average technical efficiency of arecanut farms as 0.89, implying the potential of saving the resources to the tune of 11% with a mean economic saving of 413 $ ha\xe2\x88\x921 year\xe2\x88\x921 without reducing the arecanut yield.

Abstract: 'AbstractScholars and advocates increasingly favor rights-based approaches over traditional exclusionary policies in conservation. Yet, national and international conservation policies and programs have often led to the exclusion of forest-dependent peoples. This article proposes and tests the hypothesis that the failures of rights-based approaches in conservation can be attributed in significant measure to the political economic interest of the state in the tropics. To this end, the article presents findings from the empirical analysis of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 in India. Two key recommendations emerge from this analysis. One, the proposals for operationalizing rights-based approaches will likely be far more effective if they protect the inalienability of a minimal set of rights critical to the subsistence and well-being of forest people, as opposed to promising the protection of an expansive set of rights subject to the instrumentality of conservation. Two, the proponents of rights-based approaches in conservation need to guard against their actions reinforcing the institutional status quo of the state control of forests. This, in turn, requires international conservation groups to join hands with national forest rights movements.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Political economic analysis of the proposals for rights-based approaches in conservation. \xe2\x96\xba Identifies state control of natural resources as the key barrier. \xe2\x96\xba Recommends an emphasis on a minimal set of inalienable forest rights. \xe2\x96\xba Recommends conservation groups to join hands with forest rights movements to demand state accountability.'

Title: 'Ecology and management of sacred groves in Kerala, India'
Author: 'U.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112798003260
Abstract: "AbstractIn Kerala, based on management systems, sacred groves can be categorised into three groups namely those managed by individual families, by groups of families and by the statutory agencies for temple management (Devaswom Board). Ollur Kavu, S.N. Puram Kavu and Iringole Kavu which represent above mentioned management systems, respectively, were studied for their tree species composition and vegetation structure. The study was also designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of present management systems and role of different stakeholder groups in conserving the sacred groves. Of the three sacred groves, the one managed by individual family (Ollur Kavu) is highly disturbed as indicated by low stem density of mature trees (367\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) and poor regeneration potential with the ratio between mature trees and saplings is 1:0.4. In order to quantify the level of disturbance in these sacred groves, Ramakrishnan index of stand quality (RISQ) was calculated. The values obtained for all the three tree layers (i.e., mature trees, saplings and seedlings) in single family managed sacred grove (Ollur Kavu) was between 2.265 and 2.731, an indicator of the dominance of light demanding species in the population, suggested that the grove is highly disturbed one. Whereas, other two sacred groves are less disturbed as indicated by lower `RISQ' values (between 1.319 and 1.648). Iringole Kavu and S.N. Puram Kavu were compared with some other evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India for the parameters like stem density, basal area and species diversity of trees (gbh\xe2\x89\xa510.1\xc2\xa0cm). Values obtained for these parameters in the two sacred groves are within the range obtained for other forests. Stakeholder importance value index (SIVI) was calculated based on the attributes like the proximity of the stakeholder to the sacred grove, contribution of stakeholders in managing the sacred grove, benefits being enjoyed by the stakeholder due to involvement with sacred grove and attitude of the stakeholder group towards the conservation and management of sacred grove. This indicated that local people, temple trust and/ or sacred grove owners are the major stakeholders, while in general some other stakeholder groups such as youth clubs, schools, forest department, municipality and local Panchayat with lower SIVI are comparatively neutral in conserving and managing the groves. Some of the major strategies to be adopted are self-imposed complete ban on the removal of biomass for the revitalisation of ecosystem, creation of awareness among local people and all stakeholder groups, identification of the type of contribution a stakeholder group can offer in managing the sacred grove and encouragement of all stakeholders to participate without either directly or indirectly adversely affecting the ecosystem as well as the wisdom and interest of the major stakeholder groups."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2First study to demonstrate MaxEnt\xe2\x80\x99s use for district-level occurrences.\xe2\x80\xa2All previous studies using MaxEnt used precise coordinates of species occurrences.\xe2\x80\xa2Predicted invasion potential of a cotton pest at national level in India.\xe2\x80\xa2Risk map can be used for selecting monitoring and surveillance sites and planning.\xe2\x80\xa2Approach can be used in other countries that lack precise coordinates of pests.AbstractInsect pests are a major threat to agricultural biosecurity across the world, causing substantial economic losses. Majority of the species distribution modeling studies use precise coordinates (latitude/longitude) of species occurrences in MaxEnt (or maximum entropy model). However, lack of precise coordinates of insect pest occurrences at national/regional level is a common problem for many countries including India. This is because of the limited resources, lack of nationally coordinated surveys, and growers/farmers\xe2\x80\x99 privacy issues; district-level occurrences are commonly available (e.g., National Agricultural Pest Information System or NAPIS in the United States; http://pest.ceris.purdue.edu/). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt to generate a preliminary, district-level map of the potential risk of invasion by an exotic cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Tinsley) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) in India. District-level occurrence data were integrated with bioclimatic variables (values averaged within districts) using MaxEnt. The MaxEnt model performed better than random with an average test AUC value of 0.86 (\xc2\xb10.05). Our model predictions matched closely with the documented occurrence of P. solenopsis in all nine cotton growing states, and also predicted suitable habitats in other districts across India. The greatest threat of P. solenopsis infestations were predicted in most districts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, southwestern Punjab, northwestern Rajasthan, and western Haryana. Precipitation of coldest quarter, temperature annual range, and precipitation seasonality were the strongest predictors associated with P. solenopsis distribution. Precipitation of coldest quarter was negatively correlated with P. solenopsis occurrence. Mapping the potential distribution of invasive species is an iterative process, and our study is the first attempt to model national-level risk assessment of P. solenopsis in India. Our results can be used for selecting monitoring and surveillance sites and designing local, regional and national-level integrated pest management policies for cotton and other cultivated crops in India. The maps of potential pest distributions are urgently needed by agriculture managers and policymakers. Our approach can be used in other countries that lack precise coordinates of insect pest occurrences and generate a preliminary map of potential risk because it may be too late to wait for the precise coordinates of pest occurrences to generate a perfect map.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2High quality vegetation map of India.\xe2\x80\xa215,565 GCPs.\xe2\x80\xa2100 classes.\xe2\x80\xa2Hierarchical classification scheme.AbstractA seamless vegetation type map of India (scale 1: 50,000) prepared using medium-resolution IRS LISS-III images is presented. The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge\xe2\x80\x99s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5\xc2\xa0m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.gov.in).'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn this paper, a study on the surface and deeper waters of the Yercaud Lake, Tamil Nadu, South India, was carried out to understand the geochemistry of the lake waters and also to determine its utility for agricultural purposes. Totally, 50 surface and deep water samples were collected from Yercaud Lake. Major ion and heavy metals were measured. The data obtained were interpreted using the lake water composition. The mean concentration of physicochemical parameters and heavy metals for the surface and deep waters have the following values, pH (7.6), EC (263.4), Ca2\xc2\xa0+(16.3), Mg2\xc2\xa0+(7.4), Na+(19.2), K+(1.5), Cl\xe2\x88\x92(18.2), NO3\xe2\x88\x92(1.5), SO42\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x92(1.5), HCO3\xe2\x80\x93 (97.9), Fe (1.3), Mn (0.1), Cr (0.4), Cu (0.005), Pb (0.31), Zn (0.01), Co (0.095) and Ni (0.075). The data generated reflects that the water samples are dominated by recharge process, especially due to the monsoonal rains and natural springs within the lake. The geochemical data reveals that the lake water is suitable for the agricultural purpose and the chemistry of water is mainly influenced by the weathering of bedrock, especially the charnockites bedrock. The sodium adsorption ratio and sodium percentage (%Na) values indicate that the lake water is suitable for irrigation. Dominant heavy metals in the lake waters are mainly because of the lithogenic as well as through minor anthropogenic inputs. Based on our data it is noted that proper management plans are required to monitor the pollution source in the lake, with strict policy measures.'

Title: 'Assessing recreational fisheries in an emerging economy: Knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of catch-and-release anglers in India'
Author: 'Nishikant'

Abstract: "AbstractAcross the globe, catch-and-release (C&R) angling represents a leisure activity indulged by millions. The practice of C&R is commonly advocated by conservation managers because of its potential to protect local fish populations from a range of anthropogenic threats, including over-fishing. In India, C&R angling in fresh waters has a history dating back to colonial times. Despite this, little is known about the current state of the sector. To address this, an online web-based survey was conducted to target C&R anglers who fish in Indian rivers to assess their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions relating to the status of India's freshwater C&R fisheries. From a total of 148 responses, factors such as angling quality (score of 4.6/5.0); aesthetics of surroundings (4.6/5.0), presence of other wildlife (4.4/5.0), fishery management practices (4.6/5.0) and socioeconomic benefits (4.4/5.0) were evaluated. Over 65% (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0148) of the anglers reported an observed decrease in the quality of fishing (e.g. a reduction in the size and/or numbers of fish available for capture). Respondents also considered deforestation (score of 4.2/5.0), water abstraction (4.4/5.0), pollution (4.4/5.0), hydropower projects (4.2/5.0) and destructive fishing techniques (4.7/5.0) as factors which threaten both the habitat and species they target. C&R practitioners were largely united regarding the benefits and willingness to contribute both their time and financial input to support conservation initiatives (score of 4.7/5.0). The current study provides the first overview of the status of C&R angling in India and explores challenges, opportunities, and priorities for future resource management."

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper follows the discipline of Urban Design to elaborate the concepts of disaster resilience at the neighbourhood level for the collective development of Chennai city. The increased inflow and use of resources attributed to the growing urban population creates a pressure on the various natural systems, increasing their vulnerability to multiple attacks from natural and man-made forces. Hence the future adaptability of cities is important for its growth in the aftermath of a disaster strike. The intent of this research is thus to develop a framework of strategies for an emergency response programme and to develop a design scheme to make cities resilient, through neighbourhood development. A sample precinct of Chepauk was taken up for the design demonstration after a detailed analysis of the same, addressing various physical factors such as land use, open spaces, connectivity networks, physical and social infrastructure, built density, ecology and emergency response mechanism.'

Although most of the species have appreciable importance as a source of edible tubers, ornamental flowers and implications in folk medicine, the conventional propagation techniques limit the mass propagation and their commercialization. Plant tissue culture and other biotechnological tools proved their importance in breeding and large-scale propagation of lantern flowers. In recent past, numerous in vitro regeneration approaches for micropropagation and conservation have been established for lantern flowers. Molecular markers represent powerful tools for constructing phylogenetics, taxonomic confirmations and reconsiderations of lantern flowers. Moreover, molecular markers are routinely used for ascertaining genetic integrity among the micropropagated clones of lantern flowers. This review provides comprehensive information on the biotechnological interventions for propagation, conservation, and improvement of lantern flowers. Protocols for various in vitro regeneration approaches, genetic composition, genetic fidelity analysis and in vitro secondary metabolite production are compared and optimized results are highlighted.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Potential invasion range of bushmint, an invasive plant exotic to India, was modeled.\xe2\x80\xa2MaxEnt predictions were better than GARP in predicting habitats suitable for bushmint.\xe2\x80\xa2Environmental variables defining bushmint\xe2\x80\x99s potential distribution were identified.\xe2\x80\xa2Study identifies areas for taking up surveillance and mitigation measures.AbstractBushmint (Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit.) is one among the world's most noxious weeds. Bushmint is rapidly invading tropical ecosystems across the world, including India, and is major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods. Knowledge about the likely areas under bushmint invasion has immense importance for taking rapid response and mitigation measures. In the present study, we model the potential invasion range of bushmint in India and investigate prediction capabilities of two popular species distribution models (SDM) viz., MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) and GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production). We compiled spatial layers on 22 climatic and non-climatic (soil type and land use land cover) environmental variables at India level and selected least correlated 14 predictor variables. 530 locations of bushmint along with 14 predictor variables were used to predict bushmint distribution using MaxEnt and GARP. We demonstrate the relative contribution of predictor variables and species-environmental linkages in modeling bushmint distribution. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess each model's performance and robustness. GARP had a relatively lower area under curve (AUC) score (AUC: 0.75), suggesting its lower ability in discriminating the suitable/unsuitable sites. Relative to GARP, MaxEnt performed better with an AUC value of 0.86. Overall the outputs of MaxEnt and GARP matched in terms of geographic regions predicted as suitable/unsuitable for bushmint in India, however, predictions were closer in the spatial extent in Central India and Western Himalayan foothills compared to North-East India, Chottanagpur and Vidhayans and Deccan Plateau in India."

Abstract: 'Conservation conflicts represent complex multilayered problems that are challenging to study. We explore the utility of theoretical, experimental, and constructivist approaches to games to help to understand and manage these challenges. We show how these approaches can help to develop theory, understand patterns in conflict, and highlight potentially effective management solutions. The choice of approach should be guided by the research question and by whether the focus is on testing hypotheses, predicting behaviour, or engaging stakeholders. Games provide an exciting opportunity to help to unravel the complexity in conflicts, while researchers need an awareness of the limitations and ethical constraints involved. Given the opportunities, this field will benefit from greater investment and development.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndia has tremendous potential for generating clean electricity through Renewable Energy Sources (RES) namely Hydro, Wind and Solar. This potential has been duly recognized and shows India\xd7\xb3s consciousness for reducing carbon footprint as a developing nation. Government of India with an aim to promote clean energy launched Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) on 11th January 2010, which is one of the eight missions under National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC\xe2\x80\x932008). This mission visions to install 22,000\xc2\xa0MW through grid connected and off grid power plants. Achieving an installed capacity of this quantum is a task full of challenges. To list the possible challenges and suggest a way forward, there is a need to study solar energy sector in India in the past, which has motivated the authors to discuss the evolution of solar energy in India since independence. Through this paper authors have tried to outline the journey of solar energy in India since 1950 till date and highlight the potential issues as barriers and challenges which could impact the ambitious mission taken up by Government of India.This study will help decision makers and various stakeholders to understand the current status, barriers and challenges for better planning and management in the field of solar energy.'

Title: 'Social-ecological and regional adaptation of agrobiodiversity management across a global set of research regions'

Abstract: 'AbstractTo examine management options for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, eight research regions were classified into social-ecological domains, using a dataset of indicators of livelihood resources, i.e., capital assets. Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.Graphical abstractDownload full-size imageHighlights\xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity supports the ecological intensification of agriculture. \xe2\x96\xba Agricultural landscapes can be monitored in terms of livelihood resources (capital assets). \xe2\x96\xba Natural capital is associated with local knowledge systems, not financial capital. \xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity-based interventions can be targeted for different social-ecological domains. \xe2\x96\xba Ecological intensification is knowledge-intensive and context-specific.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Fire emissions in South Asia have a noticeable impact on the O3 in this region.\xe2\x80\xa2Simulations with fire emissions show better agreement with observations.\xe2\x80\xa2Surface O3 production of 3.5\xc2\xa0Tg is estimated during spring season.AbstractIn this study, for the first time, the influence of springtime (MAM) biomass burning in South Asia on regional ozone (O3) distribution has been evaluated using a regional chemical transport model (WRF-Chem) and the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINNv1). Model results are compared with satellite retrievals of tropospheric column amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) from MOPITT and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from OMI. With daily varying emissions, the model captures reasonably well the satellite-derived temporal variations in CO and NO2 (index of agreement (R) for CO is 0.83 and for NO2 is 0.76), indicating the effectiveness of the model in estimating the overall fire impact on a regional scale. Simulated tropospheric NO2 concentration shows better agreement with the magnitude of observed NO2 when FINNv1 NOx emissions are reduced by a factor of 2.2 over the model domain. A clear increase in CO and NO2 levels over Burma (35\xe2\x80\x9360%), Central India (15\xe2\x80\x9330%), the Indo-Gangetic (15\xe2\x80\x9325%) region and the Bay of Bengal (15\xe2\x80\x9340%) are simulated with fire emissions. The model results are also used to quantify the net O3 production from fires. Calculated O3 productions are up to 4\xc2\xa0ppb\xc2\xa0h\xe2\x88\x921 over inland and up to 0.1\xc2\xa0ppb\xc2\xa0h\xe2\x88\x921 over marine regions respectively. Our model-based analysis yields average enhancement ratios \xce\x94O3/\xce\x94CO of 0.12\xc2\xa0ppbv/ppbv and a total O3 production of about 3.5\xc2\xa0Tg from South Asia during the spring season.

Climate is one of the most critical factors affecting biomes and their distribution. The present study assessed shifts in biome types of India using the conceptual framework of Holdridge life zone (HLZ) model, minimum distance classifier and climatic datasets to assess the distribution pattern of potential biomes under climate change scenarios in India. Modelling was conducted on the entire region of India using various combinations; (i) current climate scenario, and, (ii) increased temperature and precipitation scenario. The geographical analysis identifies nineteen (19) HLZs in the Indian sub-continent; seven (7) biomes and nineteen (19) sub-biomes. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the biome map prepared for current climate scenario was 82.73% and 0.75, respectively. With the changes in increasing temperature and precipitation scenario, the modelling results predict significant decrease in the area cover for tropical deserts (plains), tropical desert scrubs (lower montane), tropical moist forests (lower montane) and tropical wet forests (lower montane). Along with these changes, there have been substantial increases in the area cover for tropical dry forests (plains) and tropical very dry forests (plains), especially in central and southern India. The results show shifts from very dry tundra (alvar) to dry tundra (alpine) and moist tundra (alpine) and in some places tropical moist forests (sub-alpine) as well. In central India, decrease in tropical moist forests (lower montane) has been observed, while an increase in the area cover of tropical rain forests (plains) in northeastern India has been observed. It is important to understand the impacts and vulnerabilities of projected climate change on forest ecosystems so that better management and conservation strategies can be adopted for biodiversity and forest dependent communities. The knowledge of impact mechanisms will identify adaptation strategies for some conditions which will help in decreasing the susceptibility to anticipated climate change in the forest sector.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Historically there have been several efforts at the aesthetic integration of the river and the city.\xe2\x80\xa2In the recent past, however, the river has become much polluted on account of waste, leading several people to approach the Supreme Court of India for relief.\xe2\x80\xa2The orders issued by the Court display a preference for technological solutions and the removal of riverside encroachments.\xe2\x80\xa2In contrast to the slums which are seen as contributing to waste and pollution, large scale projects, even if on the floodplains, have been deemed to be entirely in order.\xe2\x80\xa2The nature of the threat to the river is of an irreversible kind, necessitating a precautionary approach.AbstractThis essay examines the presence of Yamuna in the city of Delhi, from two perspectives: (i) understanding riverscapes as simultaneously aquatic and terrestrial and (ii) understanding these as conjoining issues of environment and technology. With events over the course of the last century as its backdrop, the essay focuses on the last few decades of the twentieth century, to examine the relation of land and river in Delhi; the interface of people and projects, especially the issue of slums; and the risks posed to the river on account of waste and pollution. All these featured prominently in the events leading up to the staging of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October 2010, which provides the most immediate context for this essay. In conclusion, I propose that the current strategies of rejuvenating the river are limited, often anti-poor and far from sustainable.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Sacred groves near Delhi are subject to major urbanization pressures.\xe2\x80\xa2We study preferences (revealed and stated) for sacred groves along an urbanization gradient.\xe2\x80\xa2Respondents place higher values on sacred groves than on non-sacred green spaces.\xe2\x80\xa2More urbanized and sanskritized individuals are more accepting of non-forested temples.\xe2\x80\xa2These individuals are also more willing to pay for conservation of urban green space.AbstractIn India, sacred groves have been considered the forested abodes of one or multiple deities and are often managed by communal governance systems. As land development has progressed, the population surrounding these and other green spaces has changed, and responsibility for their protection has shifted to the bureaucracies that manage urban environments. The sacred grove now means different things to different people, and the value of its protection is increasingly difficult to characterize. In this context, we study individual preferences for sacred groves and non-forested temples along an urbanization gradient \xe2\x80\x93defined by land use\xe2\x80\x93 in rural locales near the megacity of Delhi, informed by the theoretical perspective of Sanskritization. We use revealed and stated preference data that includes information on visits to forests and worship sites, weighting for relevant forest characteristics, and socio-demographic factors related to culture. Respondents generally place higher value on sacred groves than on non-sacred green space, but more urbanized and sanskritized individuals exhibit higher valuations for non-forested temples and conservation of urban green space. Taken together, these results suggest a potential increase in the perception of non-sacred and non-use forest value among urbanized respondents.'

One set of reasons is associated with the flow into poverty, but a different set of reasons is associated with the flow out of poverty. Both sets of reasons vary considerably across and within states. No factor matters consistently across all states of India. Standardized national policies do not represent the best use of available resources. Diverse threats and different opportunities must be identified and tackled at the sub-national level.'

Title: 'Predicting the impact of climate change on regional and seasonal abundance of the mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) using temperature-driven phenology model linked to GIS'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Temperature-based phenology model of Phenacoccus solenopsis is simulated spatially.\xe2\x80\xa2Increased geographical suitability at higher latitudes is predicted due to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Additional 2.0 generations per year are predicted in tropics and sub-tropics.\xe2\x80\xa2The cotton losses in India are predicted to increase to million US$ 1764.85by the year 2050.AbstractThe mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is a highly invasive and polyphagous pest of global incidence. The fundamental hypothesis of the present study was that the temperature variations due to global climate change may affect seriously the future distribution and abundance of P. solenopsis, which might further aggravate the crop yield losses. We employed a temperature-based phenology model of P. solenopsis in a geographic information system for mapping population growth potentials of P. solenopsis. The three risk indices viz., establishment risk index, generation index and activity index were computed using interpolated temperature data from worldclim database for current (2000) and future (2050) climatic conditions. The daily minimum and maximum temperature data from four selected weather stations in India were used for analysing within-year variation of pest population. A linear relationship was established between the activity indices and yield losses at various locations reported in literatures for predicting the future trend of yield loss due to climate change. The results revealed that, under current temperature conditions P. solenopsis can complete >4.0 generations per year on \xe2\x88\xbc80% of the global cotton production areas. Economic losses are likely to occur in areas where at least 8.0 generations can develop in a year; under current climate \xe2\x88\xbc40% areas fall under this category. The increased geographical suitability at higher latitudes in cotton production areas, additional 2.0 generations per year, and 4.0 fold increase of population abundance of P. solenopsis are expected in tropical and sub-tropical cotton areas of Brazil, South Africa, Pakistan and India due to predicted climate change. Analysis of within year population increase at various selected locations in India revealed that, P. solenopsis attained maximum potential population increase during the major cotton growing season (May\xe2\x80\x93June to October\xe2\x80\x93November). On the other hand, the innate ability of P. solenopsis population to increase reduced considerably during off season and cooler winter months. The increased pest activity of P. solenopsis due to climate change may intensify the losses in cotton yield, with forecasted losses in India to increase from existing losses of million US$ 1217.10 to future losses of million US$ 1764.85 by the year 2050. Here, we illustrate the possible impact of climate change on future P. solenopsis exacerbation based on temperature-driven population studies, which will help in undertaking agro-ecoregion specific management strategies.'

Abstract: 'AbstractExceptional early high monsoon rains between 15 and 17 June 2013 combined with discharge from snowmelt water caused widespread floods in every major river of the Garhwal Himalaya. This catastrophic event triggered widespread landslides and devastation in the region, affecting the movement of the people that led to stranding of pilgrims in various pilgrimage routes. This event caused many casualties and irreparable damage to the infrastructures and property in the Garhwal Himalaya. A large volume of debris was deposited in Kedarnath town (3.9\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106\xc2\xa0m3), and a huge amount of debris was removed from Rambara and surrounding areas (2.6\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0108\xc2\xa0m3). The study also found that villages like Lambaghar, Bhyundar (Alaknanda River Valley), and Rambara (Mandakini River Valley) were completely washed away, leaving no trace of earlier settlement. Govindghat and Pulna villages in the Alaknanda River Valley were also badly damaged. Approximately 0.3\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106 and 0.72\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106\xc2\xa0m3 of debris was deposited, respectively. Similarly in the Mandakini Valley, Kedarnath and Sonprayag towns were also badly damaged and ~\xc2\xa03.9\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106 and ~\xc2\xa01.4\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0106\xc2\xa0m3 of debris was deposited in the area, respectively. Simultaneously, the moraine-dammed Chorabari Lake breached releasing ~\xc2\xa06.1\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0105\xc2\xa0m3 of water with an average rate of ~\xc2\xa01429\xc2\xa0m3/s (discharge of lake). The towns of Pandukeshwar in the Alaknanda Valley and Gaurikund in the Mandakini Valley were partially damaged. However, no evidence of such magnitude of destruction was reported from the Yamuna River Valley during the same period. This catastrophic event changed the landscape in many parts of Uttarakhand, making the whole region more fragile and vulnerable. A disaster of such magnitude was perhaps not witnessed by the region for at least the last 100\xc2\xa0years.'

Locally, tourism is perceived as a threat to \xe2\x80\x9ctradition\xe2\x80\x9d and religion even while a large segment of the population is dependent on its economic benefits. This ambivalence is resolved through three types of rhetoric: exclusionary, political, and religious.

Title: 'ReviewFinding the anthropocene in tropical forests'
Author: 'Patrick'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221330541830033X
Abstract: 'AbstractCommonly proposed definitions of the "anthropocene" suggest that significant human alteration of the Earth system is connected to fossil fuel consumption coinciding with the Industrial Revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, or global change resulting from the "Great Acceleration" following the Second World War. Although evidence for earlier, anthropogenically-driven environmental changes are acknowledged, they are seen as qualitatively different. This perspective is also prevalent in conservation and ecological discussions of human impacts on tropical forests. A growing body of archaeological and historical evidence demonstrates, however, that humans influenced physical, chemical, and biological systems through large regions of tropical forest starting as early as 45,000 years ago. This evidence challenges the idea, prevalent in global scenarios of anthropogenic land cover change, that human influence on tropical forests was limited until the colonial or industrial era. This paper reviews the role of tropical forests in the Earth system and, through a synthesis of archaeological data, critiques the prevailing view of anthropogenic influence on tropical forests in the pre-industrial world. We suggest that any definition of the anthropocene should account for the long history of human modifications to tropical forests. Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research in these ecosystems is also critical to the broader debates in the social and natural sciences around the onset and utility of the anthropocene concept, and the potential for long-term, sustainable occupation of tropical forest environments.'

Abstract: 'AbstractRural water supply schemes in India are generally designed for domestic uses. However, the multiple water use priorities of poor rural households in order to reduce their hardship and enhance food production, health and income mean that in water-scarce areas, domestic water use can run into conflict with productive water use. The failure of water supply agencies to design a water supply system for multiple uses results in communities not being able to realize the full potential of water as a social good. This chapter identifies various domestic and productive water requirements of rural households. Thereafter, a composite index which captures the vulnerability of rural households to problems associated with lack of water for multiple needs was assessed for three selected regions of Maharashtra, each representing a different agro-ecological and socioeconomic setting.'

Title: 'Threat evaluation for biodiversity conservation of forest ecosystems using geospatial techniques: A case study of Odisha, India'
Author: 'C. Sudhakar'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857414002158
Abstract: 'AbstractUp-scaling the evaluation of threat status of biodiversity from species to ecosystem level has remained for long a research challenge in global conservation science. To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5\xc2\xa0km\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems. Finally, identification of ecosystems especially those facing increasing extinction risks, as attempted in the present study, can help in devising an appropriate policy and management agenda for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceAlthough many plants are claimed to possess anticonvulsant/antiepileptic (AC/AE) properties, but there is very little information available about plants used by various ethnic communities in different parts of India to treat epilepsy, one of the most common disorders of central nervous system (CNS); this communication provides significant ethnomedicinal information on the plants used by indigenous communities: Bhoxa, Tharu and nomadic Gujjars of sub-Himalayan region, Uttarakhand, India to treat epilepsy, so that it could be used as a baseline data for studying chemical constituents and biological activities of these promising plants.Aims of the studyTo record herbal preparations used by the presently studied communities for treating epilepsy and discuss AC/AE properties of the recorded plants.Research strategy and methodsNinety one traditional healers (29 Bhoxa, 35 Tharu and 27 nomadic Gujjars) in sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India were interviewed to collect information on herbal preparations used by them for treating epilepsy. For each recorded species the use value (UV) and fidelity level (FL) was calculated.ResultsA total of 24 plants belonging to 24 genera and 22 families were used by the presently studied communities in 26 formulations to treat epilepsy. According to FL and UV values, most preferred species for the treatment of epilepsy by Bhoxa community are Ricinus communis L. and Datura stramonium L.; by nomadic Gujjar community are Martynia annua L., Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. and Ricinus communis L.; and by Tharu community are Allium sativum L., Asparagus racemosus Willd. and Achyranthes aspera L. Eight plants viz., Allium sativum L., Boerhavia diffusa L., Cassia fistula L., Clerodendrum viscosum Vent., Datura stramonium L., Inula cappa DC., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz and Pavetta indica L. recorded in the present survey have been reported for the first time in treatment of epilepsy by these indigenous communities in India. Five out of these eight newly reported plants viz., Cassia fistula L., Clerodendrum viscosum Vent., Inula cappa DC., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz and Pavetta indica L. have not been pharmacologically evaluated yet for their possible AC/AE properties.ConclusionsDetailed research on the listed plants and their derivatives may be undertaken to provide new alternative treatments and therapeutic uses for epilepsy or other diseases of CNS. We hope that this article will stimulate further investigations into natural products for new AC/AE agents from the recorded ethnomedicinal plants.Graphical abstractTwenty four plants (24 genera and 22 families) used by Bhoxa, Tharu and Nomadic Gujjar in 26 formulations to treat epilepsy.

Abstract: 'AbstractThere is a fast depletion of renewable sources that was used in the past for the generation of electricity and the difficulty in reachability of the grid supply to the remote villages was a big challenge faced. The best possible remedial measure in this scenario is to make use of the natural resources available to generate electricity. In an endeavourance towards this end, the paper has been formulated for the electrification of valara village in Idukki district of Kerala, India. Valara is a kind of locality in which there is a tribal settlement of about 120 families that do not have privilege of electrical energy supply. The present work focus on the preliminary studies carried out at the site for the development of a complete micro hydro power plant which focuses on three main folds such as technical as well as economical feasibility studies, design of civil works and selection of electro mechanical components. The results of the study reveal that there is a huge potential at the site to develop a micro hydro power plant which would meet the energy demand of the tribal settlement and thereby improving their living condition.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Livelihood transitions are redrawing resource landscapes of the Global South.\xe2\x80\xa2The landscapes are altered physically, socio-culturally and institutionally.\xe2\x80\xa2These altered spaces are characterized by a mosaic of emergent resource relations.\xe2\x80\xa2These are yet to be incorporated into nascent natural resource governance regimes.\xe2\x80\xa2Post-transition river basins pose diverse challenges to resource governance.AbstractThe agricultural and livelihood transitions post globalization are redefining resource relations and redrawing landscapes in the Global South and have major implications for nascent natural resource governance regimes such as Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM). A mosaic of divergent reciprocations in resource relations were noticed due to livelihood transitions in the rural areas where previous resource uses and relations had been primarily within agriculture. The reconstitution of rural spaces and the attendant changes in the resource equations are observed to be creating new sites of conformity, contestation and conflicts that often move beyond local spaces. This paper critically reviews studies across the Global South to explore the nature and extent of changes in resource relations and agricultural landscapes post livelihood diversification and the implication and challenges of these changes for natural resource governance. Though there is drastic reduction in agricultural livelihoods throughout the Global South, changes in agricultural area are found to be inconsistent and heterogeneous in the region. Agriculture continues in the countrysides but in widely differentiated capacities and redefined value systems. The transformed agrarian spaces are characterized by a mosaic of scenarios from persistence and sustainable subsistence to differentiation and exploitative commercial practices to abandonment and speculation. The reconfigured resource relations, emergent multiple and multi-scalar interest groups, institutional and policy changes and altered power differentials in these diversified landscapes are yet to be incorporated into natural resource governance frameworks such as IRBM.'

Title: 'Exploring biodiversity and climate change benefits of community-based forest management'

URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378008000228
Abstract: 'AbstractEmissions from deforestation are significant and account for more than 18% of global annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. With the Bali Action Plan categorically placing reduced emissions from degradation and deforestation (REDD) activities on the agenda of future climate change negotiations, there is now a strong possibility that policy approaches and incentives relating to enhancement of carbon stocks in low biomass forests will be successfully negotiated and accepted as a legitimate greenhouse gas mitigation option in the upcoming post-2012 climate change regime. Using the institutional mechanisms provided by community-based forest management (CBFM), 833.8\xc2\xa0Tg carbon can be sequestered by enhancement of forest carbon stocks in low biomass Indian forests. By protection refugia, restoring biodiversity, providing connectivity, mimicking nature in plantations and controlling man-made fires, CBFM as practiced in India can be an effective way of managing forests during times of climate change. Appropriately designed CBFM policy can provide means to sustain and strengthen community livelihoods and at the same time avoid deforestation, restore forest cover and density, provide carbon mitigation and create rural assets. Channeling carbon investment funds into CBFM projects can make both development and conservation economically viable and attractive for the local communities to maintain biodiversity and integrity of nature. However, before actual funding under the Clean Development Mechanism and other international C investment funds is available, policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to REDD need to be negotiated and agreed upon by the participating nations to UNFCCC.'

Title: 'Do community-conserved areas effectively conserve biological diversity? Global insights and the Indian context'
Author: 'Ghazala'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe view that biodiversity-rich areas partially or largely managed by local residents, sometimes referred to as community-conserved areas (CCAs), can be effective in biological conservation has gained considerable ground over the past decade. In this paper, we review available scientific information on the conservation effectiveness of such areas globally. We compiled studies undertaken during the last 5\xc2\xa0years (2004\xe2\x80\x932009) that use quantifiable ecological attributes to: (1) compare CCAs with strictly protected areas (SPAs); (2) compare CCAs with open-access ecosystems and (3) study trends in biological attributes of CCAs over time. We found that there were few consistent differences in diversity/species richness of flora or fauna protected under the two types of management or in deforestation rates. However, CCAs tend to harbour a species complement distinct from that of SPAs and show lowered abundances of monitored taxa that are of conservation importance. CCAs conserve biological values more effectively than open-access areas. Also, biological values tend to decline in CCAs over time. We conclude that CCAs could represent a significant improvement over open-access areas in terms of conservation effectiveness, yet fall short of the needs of comprehensive biological conservation. While extremely few studies have been undertaken in India, the trends seen largely concur with global ones. This review, based on a limited sample size, is only a beginning, and is expected to serve as an invitation for further research to address both the question of biological effectiveness of diverse forest governance regimes as well as the socio-economic, demographic and institutional reasons underlying these differences.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2A detailed spatiotemporal analysis of urban expansion and urban typologies of Pune metropolis at unit administrative scale.\xe2\x80\xa2The speed of the urbanization has doubled during 2001\xe2\x80\x932013 in comparison of 1992\xe2\x80\x932001.\xe2\x80\xa2The areas under civil administration show positive urban growth whereas under defence administration show marginal growth.\xe2\x80\xa2Varied urban expansion patterns are observed in Pune metropolis in support of diffusion\xe2\x80\x93coalescence phase of urbanization.AbstractIndian cities are expanding at an unprecedented rate. The speed of development poses a challenge for urban planners, as the expansion of cities frequently outpaces the planning process. This leads to further challenges for urban planners, namely i) the database for the planning is often outdated and ii) processes and patterns of unplanned urban growth are not accounted for appropriately. This paper presents an approach to address these challenges by utilizing generally available and inexpensive remote sensing data to study i) the land use and land cover change and ii) by analyzing the extent of urban areas to study the patterns and processes of urban growth. We assesses land-use/land-cover for three years (1992, 2001, 2013) using multi-temporal Landsat datasets. A detailed spatiotemporal analysis of urban expansion and typologies of urban growth at the scale of individual administrative units. The dynamics of urban growth was quantified using different metrics of urban expansion. Three types of urban expansion patterns were identified in the Pune metropolis, i) coalescence phase of urbanization in the main city areas, ii) diffusion phase in the suburbs and iii) marginal growth in the cantonments. The overall process of urban expansion in the Pune metropolis can thus be referred to as a diffusion\xe2\x80\x93coalescence pattern. Furthermore, our results show that the speed of the urban expansion in the Pune metropolis area has doubled from 2001 to 2013 as compared to 1992\xe2\x80\x932001. Urban land has increased at the cost of grasslands, barren and agricultural lands. The percentage of change is high in the suburbs under semi-urban and village council jurisdictions, whereas in terms of total growth, areas under the municipal corporation jurisdictions are among the highest contributors to urban expansion. Administrative units governed by cantonment boards have shown marginal growth as compared to the civil administrative units in the study area.'

This paper reviews the studies that have tried to estimate the value of forest ecosystem services. Broadly, this study addresses the following questions: (1) What insights do these studies provide on the value of forest ecosystems? (2) What lessons do they offer from an economic and policy perspective? (3) What are the shortcomings of the existing studies, and what are the challenges and issues for future research? Evidence from a cross section of forest sites, countries and regions suggests that not only the total valuation of ecosystem services varies widely across studies but also the valuation of individual services. This variation suggests that policies to conserve ecosystems and their services should emphasise local contexts and values. This paper concludes by discussing the shortcomings of existing studies, and suggests that, among other things, future research should focus on the neglected ecosystem services, \xe2\x80\x98disservices\xe2\x80\x99, assess the role of dynamic factors and environmental catastrophes on the provision of ecosystem services, and assess the benefits of keeping forests intact versus converting them to alternative uses.'

Title: 'Place-making and environmental change in a Hindu pilgrimage site in India'
Author: 'Kiran A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718511001436
Abstract: 'AbstractMany Hindu pilgrimage sites in India experience heavy influxes of pilgrims and are subject to considerable environmental impact. Existing literature on the study of the environment in pilgrimage sites, however, appears to follow two divergent directions: one emphasizes degradation of the physical environment while the other highlights the sacred character of the place and how that is compromised by contemporary visitor flows. The aim of this paper is to move beyond this divergence and to demonstrate how contemporary environmental problems are outcomes related to a historical process of environmental change that accompanies the making of a sacred place. This paper is based on a case study of Vrindavan, a Hindu pilgrimage site associated with Krishna worship in northern India. More than 6\xc2\xa0million visitors visit Vrindavan annually. Using a historical geography approach and socio-spatial dialectic conceptual framework, the paper explains how this pilgrimage landscape was established in the 15th century, and how since then it has evolved into a religious-urban place comprising more than 5500 temples. Its development is categorized into three periods: pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial. In each period, the socio-spatial fabric showed significant transformations that resulted from the interaction of three critical factors: the influence of local and global socio-economic processes on the cultural economy of pilgrimage, the relationship of this economy to spatial change, and institutional controls that regulated the other two factors. It is argued that the environment of pilgrimage is simultaneously social, economic, cultural and religious and shaped by the need to maintain the place as sacred. This insight is useful for a better understanding of contemporary environmental problems so that they may be addressed effectively.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Environmental change takes place as a sacred place evolves into a pilgrimage site. \xe2\x96\xba The cultural economy of pilgrimage is dialectically related to spatial change. \xe2\x96\xba Changing notions of sacredness generate varied meanings of the environment in a place. \xe2\x96\xba The environment of pilgrimage is at once social, economic, cultural and religious. \xe2\x96\xba Institutional arrangements influence the intensity and pace of environmental change.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe phrase \xe2\x80\x98small is beautiful\xe2\x80\x99 holds true for the micro-hydro plants discussed in this article. Micro-hydro plants can convert the energy of falling water into electricity. In India, access to electricity cannot be taken for granted, especially in rural areas, which do not yet have grid extension or where it is too costly or infeasible. In these cases, micro-hydro plants are a welcome solution. Here I discuss the efforts of two non-governmental organizations, a private company, and a government agency, to facilitate micro-hydro projects in India, thereby increasing the socio-economic empowerment of rural inhabitants without electricity access. Based on extensive ethnographic data and constructivist conceptualizations of scale and consequences I find that these projects can indeed be described as \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d technology interventions. In line with the common discourse on \xe2\x80\x9csmall is beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d the projects emphasize community engagement, control, and locality. Yet, importantly, they are \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d in diverse ways. The actors set different priorities when implementing their small-scale technology interventions. Highlighting these priorities is important because they can empower people to acquire different roles, ranging from engaged consumers to prosumers. Instead of solely concentrating on the (small) scale of a technology I plead to consider the significance of implementing these interventions.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndian health-care sector is composed of Ayurveda, naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and traditional folklore that are entirely dependent on raw material from Himalayan medicinal and aromatic plants. There has been an immense growth in herbal sector due to increased proclivity of modern civilization toward herbal-based drugs. Due to huge demand of herbal-based drugs, there are concomitant decline in biodiversity and higher incidences of biopiracy along with improper framing of regulation and inappropriate regulations. Indiscriminate harvesting and loss of traditional knowledge pertaining to Himalayan herb cultivation and its utilization have hampered the emergence of Indian herb trade in international market. In the current chapter, we have made an attempt to outline link between medicinal plant management and marketing. This chapter will provide insights into facts regarding global market opportunities for Indian herbal sector in international trade. We will review market demand and rate of import and export of Indian Himalayan herbs. Finally, this chapter will conclude with the overview of challenges that limit expansion of herbal sector in international market.'

Title: "Urbanization, the energy ladder and forest transitions in India's emerging economy"
Author: 'R.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837709000738
Abstract: 'AbstractUrbanization is currently a major force in tropical land use transitions as economic activities aggregate in urban centers, particularly in Asia. This paper examines relationships among urbanization, household energy source, and forest cover at the state level in India using available census, survey, and remote sensing analysis from the 1990s and 2000s. Central questions include (1) how rapidly are urban and rural households switching from traditional to modern fuel sources; and (2) what are the consequences of changing household energy sources for fuelwood demand and forest cover. Country-wide, 30 and 78% of urban and rural households respectively used fuelwood for cooking in 1993. In urban households, the percentage decreased to 22% by 2005 with a shift towards liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The shift occurred across almost all income classes. In rural areas, the use of LPG increased fourfold but 75% of households still rely on fuelwood. Despite the decline in percentage households using traditional fuels, fuelwood demand continued to increase from 1993 to 2005 at a national scale due to an increasing total number of households. However, 25% of states and union territories experienced declines in rural fuelwood demand and over 70% declines in urban fuelwood demand. Forest cover has remained steady or increased slightly over the time period, reaffirming the conclusion that fuelwood demand may lead to local degradation but not large-scale deforestation. At the state level, increases in percent forest cover between 2000 and 2004 are positively associated with percent of total households that are urban (corresponding to fewer percentage households using wood) but not related to changes in fuelwood demand. Plantations are a primary cause of increases in forest area, where benefits to ecosystem services such as biodiversity and hydrologic function are controversial. Results suggest that households will continue to climb the energy ladder with future urbanization, resulting in substantial development benefits and reduced exposure to indoor air pollution. Implications of reduced fuelwood demand for forest cover are less certain but the limited data suggest that urbanization will promote a transition to increasing forest cover in the Indian context.'

This scenario is particularly troublesome in developing countries where secondary cities are growing at an unprecedented rate but lack the institutional capacity to manage urbanization. Secondary cities are tier II cities below primary cities in the urban hierarchy. To examine the unique challenges and opportunities facing secondary cities, we trace Pune's urban growth. Pune is the second largest city in the state of Maharashtra, India and is emerging as an industrial and educational hub. The presence of large industrial and educational sectors has resulted in massive urban population growth, including a large migrant population from rural areas. This massive growth is straining Pune's critical infrastructures. First, we trace Pune's urban history in terms of social, economic, administrative, and environmental planning and development. Second, we examine key urban challenges faced by the city. We find that while the city of Pune is moving towards becoming a megacity, it still has a chance to change its trajectory to become one that is more sustainable, equitable, and just. However, to evolve into a sustainable and equitable city, Pune's urban planners need to pay careful attention to several urbanization issues. This profile offers insights regarding the unique challenges faced by secondary cities in developing countries and discusses policy implications to transform secondary cities into catalysts for economic growth and development."

Title: 'Are input controls required in individual transferable quota fisheries to address ecosystem based fisheries management objectives?'
Author: 'Timothy J.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis study examined the use of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) to effectively manage fishing impacts on all ecosystem components, as required under Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) principles. A consequence of changing from input controls to output-based (catch) management is that the control of the regulating authority tends to be reduced, which may affect the outcomes for ecosystem management. This study reviewed the use of input controls across six fishing methods in 18 ITQ fisheries, which have been independently accredited as ecologically sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (12 fisheries) or under Australian environmental legislation for Wildlife Trade Operation (six fisheries). Input controls were retained across a range of ITQ fisheries, with non-selective fisheries such as trawl, gillnet and line employing more input controls than selective fisheries such as purse-seine, pot/trap and dredge. Further case-studies confirmed the widespread and recent use of input controls (spatial and temporal closures) with the aim of managing ecosystem impacts of fishing. The retention of input controls, particularly closures affects the security (quality of title) characteristic of the fishing use right and the theoretical ability of fishers to manage their right for their future benefit. The security characteristic is weakened by closures through loss of access, which undermines industry trust and incentive for long-term decision making. By reducing the security of ITQs, individual fisher incentives and behaviour may separate from societal objectives for sustainability, which was one of the foremost reasons for introducing ITQ management.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Eighteen ITQ fisheries were reviewed for the presence/absence of input controls. \xe2\x96\xba Number of input controls was highest for non-selective fishing methods such as trawl. \xe2\x96\xba Spatial closures are increasingly used in ITQ fisheries to meet EBFM requirements. \xe2\x96\xba The continued use of input controls weakens the security characteristic of the ITQ. \xe2\x96\xba Weakening the security characteristic may alter fisher incentives and behaviour.'

Abstract: 'AbstractDrought is a natural hazard whose consequences are strongly affected by various components of the hydrological cycle. Among the various hydrological variables, soil moisture component plays a major role in determining drought since it is controlled by various other subprocesses. In spite of its importance in agriculture and drought monitoring, soil moisture information is not widely available on watershed basis. This chapter gives an idea of different drought types and importance of agricultural drought estimation through hydrological models. As a case study, an open source distributed hydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool is used to develop soil moisture records of a semiarid watershed in southern part of India. The soil moisture is then used to derive the standardized soil moisture index. The study promises a drought monitoring system based on soil moisture. The proposed methodology is also suitable for an extended use with any other hydrological quantities.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The inherent vulnerability assessment has been carried out for twelve villages.\xe2\x80\xa2Hazard generic framework considers using socio-economic indicators.\xe2\x80\xa2Inherent vulnerability was captured using eight sub-components and 16 indicators.\xe2\x80\xa2Inherent Vulnerability Score (IVS) was computed for each of the twelve villages.\xe2\x80\xa2Access to water was found to be an important determinant through IVS.AbstractThe study focuses on the assessment of inherent vulnerability of rural communities in Kimsar region to environmental hazards. A new conceptual framework was developed and hazard generic socio-economic indicators were identified in the assessment of inherent vulnerability of the communities to future harm. All the households from the selected villages were surveyed to collect information on the identified indicators. These indicators captured eight sub-components of inherent vulnerability, which includes lack of access to water, shelter, information, and connectivity, economic capacity, dependence on environmental resources, marginalised communities and gender. An Inherent Vulnerability Score (IVS) was computed, for each of the twelve villages by aggregating the data into a composite score. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the composite score. The results obtained from a cluster analysis on the same village-level data were consistent with the IVS. Based on the results of cluster analysis, the villages were classified into three vulnerability groups \xe2\x94\x80 high, moderate and low. Access to water, dependence on environmental resources and shelter were found to be the most important determinants of inherent vulnerability in the region. Knowledge of inherent vulnerability will aid decision-makers to formulate policies, which will reduce vulnerability and help in rational distribution of resources among various communities.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Crop loss, caste, and resources affect income diversification in a poor and remote area of India.\xe2\x80\xa2Social networks amplify the effects of those characteristics on income diversification.\xe2\x80\xa2The number of network connections is more important than centrality of connections.SummaryIncome diversification continues to be a key strategy for poor rural households, including those that are progressively developing and those operating under increasing distress. The ability of a household to diversify has been shown to depend upon its demographic and economic characteristics and its physical and social context. This paper considers the effects of intra-village social networks on household income diversification in one of the poorest and most ethnically diverse areas of the Indian state of Kerala. Using techniques adapted from spatial econometrics, we find that social connections within a village magnify the impacts of household characteristics such as education and number of adults by a factor of 3.6 times. Models with alternative measures of network centrality (degree and eigenvector) indicate that the number of network connections that a household has is more important than the centrality of those connections. Finally, we use social contact information to calculate assortative mixing based on caste. The results suggest social stratification in these villages, with higher levels of stratification associated with lower levels of income diversification.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We present a model to explore impact of forest management on hydrologic processes.\xe2\x80\xa2Results indicate that surface flow and soil water increases after forest management.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change has little impact on near-future discharge, dramatic impact by 2100.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change leads to reduced soil moisture in the future period.\xe2\x80\xa2Forest hydrology models show potential for informing environmental management.AbstractThe importance of water quantity for domestic and industrial water supply, agriculture, and the economy more broadly has led to the development of many water quantity assessment methods. In this study, surface flow and soil water in the forested upper reaches of the Yoshino River are compared using a distributed hydrological model with Forest Maintenance Module under two scenarios; before and after forest maintenance. We also examine the impact of forest maintenance on these variables during extreme droughts. Results show that surface flow and soil water increased after forest maintenance. In addition, projections of future water resources were estimated using a hydrological model and the output from a 20\xc2\xa0km mesh Global Climate Model (GCM20). River discharge for the near-future (2015\xe2\x80\x932039) is similar to that of the present (1979\xe2\x80\x932003). Estimated river discharge for the future (2075\xe2\x80\x932099) was found to be substantially more extreme than in the current period, with 12\xc2\xa0m3/s higher peak discharge in August and 7\xc2\xa0m3/s lower in July compared to the discharges of the present period. Soil water for the future is estimated to be lower than for the present and near future in May. The methods discussed in this study can be applied in other regions and the results help elucidate the impact of forests and climate change on water resources.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (205KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'OpinionWhy is it important to study malaria epidemiology in India?'
Author: 'Vineeta'

Abstract: 'Malaria is a major vector-borne disease in India. Based on vast geographic areas with associated topographic and climatic diversity, the variable malaria epidemiology in India is associated with high parasite genetic diversity and rapidly evolving drug resistance, differential distribution of vector species and emerging insecticide resistance and underlying human genetic diversity and past evolutionary histories. Further, changing climatic patterns have possibly changed malaria epidemiology to a great extent. The outcome of these changes is an increased incidence of Plasmodium falciparum over the P. vivax malaria in recent years. Accordingly, the drug and insecticide application policy in India has changed too. The above facts and associated rapid shifting trend of malaria epidemiology makes India a hot-spot for malaria research.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe Mughal settlements are an integral part of Old Dhaka. Uncontrolled urbanization, changes in land use patterns, the growing density of new settlements, and modern transportation have brought about rapid transformation to the historic fabric of the Mughal settlements. As a result, Mughal structures are gradually turning into isolated elements in the transforming fabric. This study aims to promote the historic quality of the old city through clear and sustainable integration of the Mughal settlements in the existing fabric. This study attempts to analyze the Mughal settlements in old Dhaka and correspondingly outline strategic approaches to protect Mughal artifacts from decay and ensure proper access and visual exposure in the present urban tissue.'

The various losses due to HS and the Benefit- Cost of the vaccination programme in cattle and water buffaloes were studied using mathematical models. The number of HS outbreaks were higher during the year 2002 and peaked during 2005 and thereafter declined due to targeted vaccination against HS. The morbidity and mortality risks were lower in large farms than medium and small farms, and lower in indigenous cattle compared to high yielding crossbred cattle and water buffaloes. The disease occurrence was more in in-milk animals causing serious economic loss to the farmers. Most outbreaks were observed during monsoon season, though the disease was prevalent throughout the year. The mean milk loss per animal was $2, $11 and $50 in indigenous cattle, water buffaloes and crossbred cattle, respectively. In the case of draught animals, the average effective draught power was unavailable for 1.2\xc2\xa0days/outbreak resulting in a loss of $5 per affected oxen. The treatment and extra labor expenses incurred per animal were $24 and $7, respectively. The average loss per animal due to mortality loss was $275, $284 and $415 in case of indigenous cattle, water buffaloes and crossbred cattle, respectively. The projected loss for the state of Karnataka were $23.89, $17.92 and $11.95 million under high, medium and low HS incidence scenarios, respectively. The Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) of the vaccination against HS has been estimated at 5.97:1, 4.48:1 and 2.98:1 under high, medium and low incidence scenarios, respectively. The results highlight the important epidemiological features and financial losses to the affected households and the state of Karnataka.'

Title: 'Chapter Four - Potential and Challenges of Rainfed Farming in India'
Author: 'Cherukumalli'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211315001091
Abstract: "AbstractIndia ranks first in rainfed agriculture globally in both area (86\xc2\xa0Mha) and the value of produce. Rainfed regions in India contribute substantially toward food grain production including 44% of rice, 87% of coarse cereals (sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), maize (Zea mays)), and 85% of food legumes, 72% of oilseeds, 65% of cotton, and 90% of minor millets. Overall, the rainfed areas produce 40% of the food grains, support two-thirds of the livestock population, and are critical to food security, equity, and sustainability.India is home to 18% of world's population, 15% of the world livestock, 4.2% of fresh water resources, 1% of forests, and 0.5% of pasture land, but only has 2.3% of the geographical area. India is home to 25% of the world's hungry population of \xe2\x88\xbc1 billion along with an estimated 43% of children malnourished under the age of five. The net sown area in India has remained constant for several years at 141\xc2\xa0Mha, but the human and livestock populations have been steadily increasing. Though the Indian population increased from 361 million in 1951 to 1140 million in 2011, tripling over 60\xc2\xa0years, the food-grain production has more than quadrupled, but the yield gains are largely from the irrigated agroecosystems. Notwithstanding the increase in average productivity from 0.6\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in the 1980s to 1.1\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 at the present time, large yield gaps exist for rainfed crops in the semiarid regions. Even after realizing the full irrigation potential, nearly 40% of the net sown area of 141\xc2\xa0Mha will remain totally rainfed. The per capita availability of land has fallen drastically from 2.4\xc2\xa0ha in 1951 to about 0.32\xc2\xa0ha in 2001; and it is projected to decline further to 0.09\xc2\xa0ha by 2050. Increasing productivity of rainfed cropping systems is of critical importance to meet the food demands of an ever-increasing population in India.The potential productivity of maize (Z. mays) in high rainfall regions under rainfed condition is 8.0\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 vis-a-vis the national average yield of 2.1\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, indicating an unbridged yield gap of \xe2\x88\xbc6\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. Large yield gaps exist in other crops as well which are primarily grown under rainfed conditions. Recommended management practices (RMPs) such as improved cultivars, site specific nutrient management (precision agriculture), and water harvesting and recycling can potentially increase the yields in several crops up to 6\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, indicating the large realizable potential under rainfed conditions. There are many districts in India where the actual yields are much lower than the national average, and there is enormous potential for improvement. The objective of this article is to discuss the production potentials and the yield gaps of predominant crops grown under rainfed conditions in India, biotic and abiotic constraints, and RMPs for realizing the potentials."

Abstract: "Bel-Air College of Nursing in India promotes nondiscriminatory care of persons living with HIV throughout its programs, albeit with no specific intervention. We examined whether nursing students' stigmatizing attitudes were related to number of years at Bel-Air. At the start of the 2015 and 2016 academic years, 310 Bachelor's (BScN; 4-year program) and 119 Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM; 2-year program) students completed the Zelaya and colleagues (2008) Stigma Scale (24 Likert-type items). Three subscales (Fear, Blame, Personal Discrimination) measured Overall Personal Stigma. The fourth subscale measured Perceived Community Discrimination. BScN students' mean Overall Personal Stigma and subscales scores declined and Perceived Community Discrimination scores increased from Year 1 to 4. For ANM students, Overall Personal Stigma, Fear, and Personal Discrimination scores were lower for Year 2 than Year 1 students. Bel-Air emphasizes effective and nondiscriminatory care throughout the entire curriculum, providing a model for reducing student nurses' stigmatizing attitudes."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe governments of Brazil and India are planning a large expansion of bioethanol and biodiesel production in the next decade. Considering that limitation of suitable land and/or competition with other land uses might occur in both countries, assessments of potential crop productivity can contribute to an improved planning of land requirements for biofuels under high productivity or marginal conditions. In this paper we model the potential productivity of sugarcane and jatropha in both countries. Land requirements for such expansions are calculated according to policy scenarios based on government targets for biofuel production in 2015. Spatial variations in the potential productivity lead to rather different land requirements, depending on where plantations are located. If jatropha is not irrigated, land requirements to fulfill the Indian government plans in 2015 would be of 410\xe2\x80\x88000 to 95\xe2\x80\x88000\xc2\xa0km2 if grown in low or high productivity areas respectively (mean of 212\xe2\x80\x88000\xc2\xa0km2). In Brazil land requirements, are of 18\xe2\x80\x88000\xe2\x80\x9389\xe2\x80\x88000\xc2\xa0km2 (mean of 29\xe2\x80\x88000\xc2\xa0km2), suggesting a promising substitute to soybean biodiesel. Although future demand for sugarcane ethanol in Brazil is approximately ten times larger than in India, land requirements are comparable in both countries due to large differences in ethanol production systems. In Brazil this requirement ranges from 25\xe2\x80\x88000 to 211\xe2\x80\x88000\xc2\xa0km2 (mean of 33\xe2\x80\x88000\xc2\xa0km2) and in India from 7000 to 161\xe2\x80\x88000\xc2\xa0km2 (mean 17\xe2\x80\x88000\xc2\xa0km2). Irrigation could reduce the land requirements by 63% and 41% (24% and 15%) in India (Brazil) for jatropha and sugarcane respectively.'

Title: 'Joint forest management in India: Experiences of two decades'
Author: 'Prodyut'

Abstract: "AbstractJoint Forest Management (JFM), embracing the philosophy of forest conservation and livelihood improvement through cooperation between state and civil society, has emerged over the past decades both as a specific paradigm of forest governance in India and as India's largest community forestry program. The JFM program, evolved during early 1970s covering a few forest villages as a model for reversing the trend of degraded forest ecosystem through the active protection by local villagers. The JFM program is implemented currently by 106,482 Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMC) and it covers 22 million ha of forests spread across 28 constituent states of India and union territories.JFM emerged against a backdrop of two centuries of centralised bureaucratic control over forest management in India. Centralized control during the 19th and 20th centuries failed either to conserve resources or to contribute substantially to the well-being of local populations. However, inconsistent persuasions from decentralization policies in India under present forest policy (1988) have prompted people to analyse the theoretical basis for accepting that decentralization would bring improvements in forest ecosystem management. Still others have contested the de facto rationale for decentralization (i.e., improved forest management) and have suggested that decentralization may be a manipulation by elites to serve their own interests or to shift power, for example from national to international agencies that have funded decentralization. Thirty years from its inception, there are now concerns for the recent effectiveness of JFM (over the past 20 years) because it is a group action that is getting old and is perhaps losing some of its pioneering drive and innovativeness.Although JFM has been administered nationally, decisions on implementation detail have been left to the individual states, resulting in different strategies. The long history of JFM has also provided scope for experiences with it to change over time as well as between places.Given the range of experiences with and perceptions of JFM, as well as the importance of the objectives JFM ostensibly serves, the time is ripe therefore for a retrospective evaluation to take stock of its actual achievements, its status and ways forward. The current paper seeks to provide such a review and analysis.The paper highlights design and implementation issues related to government resolutions, benefits-sharing and forest offences. It also assesses the critical design factors and key drivers responsible for institutional reforms. The paper evaluates impacts of protection on forest productivity and on the livelihoods of local communities. It highlights that the JFM program, by virtue of the diversity of its implementation, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring why similar reforms can lead to different outcomes. The paper argued that though there are supporting government policy and guideline and massive fund support, why there has been a low down of enthusiasm for JFM in the last two decades. From experiences, it suggests strategies for its revival and JFM can further contribute effective toward forest conservation and enhanced livelihood opportunities in the future."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The characterization of atmospheric Black Carbon (BC) aerosol has been reported over Vijayawada for the first time.\xe2\x80\xa2A significant diurnal and seasonal variation in BC and BB (%) is observed.\xe2\x80\xa2Occurrence of fire events in and around the region during winter and summer seasons reveals the dominance of local BB.\xe2\x80\xa2Higher values of annual mean \xce\xb1 indicates the observation site is dominated by biomass burning aerosols.\xe2\x80\xa2CWT analysis reveals that airmasses arriving from north and central India also influence the observed BC properties.AbstractContinuous measurements of Black Carbon (BC) mass concentration using an advanced multi wavelength Aethalometer (AE-33) during January\xe2\x80\x93December 2016 were carrried out, for the first time, at the premises of KL University, Vijayawada (16.44\xc2\xb0N, 80.62\xc2\xb0E, 30\xe2\x80\xafm amsl), a semi-urban site in the southeast India. The estimates of the percentage contribution of Biomass Burning (BB%) aerosols to total BC concentration is utilised to understand the contribution of anthropogenic activities over the observational site. In this context, the diurnal and seasonal variation of BC mass concentrations and BB (%) contributions have been investigated and the possible sources are examined. A significant diurnal variation in BC concentration is observed with two prominent peaks, one occuring in the morning hours (around 0800\xe2\x80\x930900 IST) and the other occuring in the evening hours (around 2000 IST). Annually, the maximum BC concentration is observed during November (6.88\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.56\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923) and minimum during August (1.7\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.52\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923) over this location. On a seasonal scale, mean BC mass concentration is highest during winter (DJF, 4.68\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.32\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923) followed by post-monsoon (SON, 4.52\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf2.36\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923), summer (MAM, 2.44\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.8\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923) and lowest during monsoon (JJA, 1.83\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.61\xe2\x80\xaf\xce\xbcg\xe2\x80\xafm\xe2\x88\x923). The higher BB (%) contribution is observed during summer (25.21\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf7.02%), while the contribution is minimum in monsoon season (16.83\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf4.15%). Examination of the spectral properties of aerosol absorption in terms of \xc3\x85ngstr\xc3\xb6m exponent (\xce\xb1) indicates that the major contributor of BC over this location is biomass burning (\xce\xb1 ~ 1.66\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.06). This is supported by the higher number of fire counts (obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-MODIS onboard Terra satellite) in and around the study region during winter and summer revealing the higher contribution of BB aerosols. The concentration weighted trajectories (CWT) analysis (based on 5-day airmass back trajectories arriving the receptor site at an altitude of 500\xe2\x80\xafm AGL) reveals that synoptic airmasses arriving from the continental regions located northeast of the observational sites mainly influence the BC properties over Vijayawada.'

Title: 'Satellite Earth observation data to identify anthropogenic pressures in selected protected areas'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Parks experience stress from human pressures, which require mapping and monitoring.\xe2\x80\xa2Earth observation (EO) data can monitor changes in state resulting from pressure over time.\xe2\x80\xa2Impact on landscapes, habitats and species communities can be related to pressure.\xe2\x80\xa2EO data useful for monitoring pressure and changes in state are listed for parks in six countries.\xe2\x80\xa2The approach is illustrated in two contexts in Italy and The Netherlands.AbstractProtected areas are experiencing increased levels of human pressure. To enable appropriate conservation action, it is critical to map and monitor changes in the type and extent of land cover/use and habitat classes, which can be related to human pressures over time. Satellite Earth observation (EO) data and techniques offer the opportunity to detect such changes. Yet association with field information and expert interpretation by ecologists is required to interpret, qualify and link these changes to human pressure. There is thus an urgent need to harmonize the technical background of experts in the field of EO data analysis with the terminology of ecologists, protected area management authorities and policy makers in order to provide meaningful, context-specific value-added EO products. This paper builds on the DPSIR framework, providing a terminology to relate the concepts of state, pressures, and drivers with the application of EO analysis. The type of pressure can be inferred through the detection of changes in state (i.e. changes in land cover and/or habitat type and/or condition). Four broad categories of changes in state are identified, i.e. land cover/habitat conversion, land cover/habitat modification, habitat fragmentation and changes in landscape connectivity, and changes in plant community structure. These categories of change in state can be mapped through EO analyses, with the goal of using expert judgement to relate changes in state to causal direct anthropogenic pressures. Drawing on expert knowledge, a set of protected areas located in diverse socio-ecological contexts and subject to a variety of pressures are analysed to (a) link the four categories of changes in state of land cover/habitats to the drivers (anthropogenic pressure), as relevant to specific target land cover and habitat classes; (b) identify (for pressure mapping) the most appropriate spatial and temporal EO data sources as well as interpretations from ecologists and field data useful in connection with EO data analysis. We provide detailed examples for two protected areas, demonstrating the use of EO data for detection of land cover/habitat change, coupled with expert interpretation to relate such change to specific anthropogenic pressures. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and feasibility of using EO data and techniques to identify anthropogenic pressures, suggesting additional research efforts required in this direction.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe \xe2\x80\x9cKerala model of development\xe2\x80\x9d has won wide international attention for its achievements in regard to social development and, to a certain extent, environmental sustainability. The \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d Kerala model, preoccupied with redistributive policies, failed, however, to induce economic development. As a result, attention is now being given to a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d Kerala model. The new policy explicitly seeks reconciliation of social, productive and environmental objectives at the local level, and tries to develop synergies between civil society, local governmental bodies and the state government. The new Kerala model thus holds important lessons for participatory, community-based sustainable development in India and elsewhere.'

Presently, some of these long-term observational studies are functional, some are disturbed and others have almost been lost. The accumulated data will become increasingly important in the context of environmental modelling and climate change, especially if the plots and data can be maintained and/or revived. This contribution presents the history and current state of forest research plots in India, including details of locations and re-measurements. We provide a brief introduction of the National Forest Inventory (NFI), Preservation Plots in natural forests, the 50-ha Mudumalai Forest Dynamics Plot as part of the Centre for Tropical Forest Science and Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatories network (CTFS\xe2\x80\x93SIGEO), and research plots established in plantations for tree growth studies and modelling. We also present some methodological details including assessment and analysis for two types of observational studies, the Tree Count Plots (TCP) and Tree Re-measurement Plots (TRP). Arguments are presented in favour of enumeration and analysis methods which are consistent with current approaches in forest ecological research.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMulti-source earth observation data are highly desirable in nowaday landslide hazard prediction modeling. Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) is a very important content of landslide hazard prediction modeling. In this paper, take Wan county for instance, we investigate the potentials of derivation from hybrid data sets to study landslide hazard zonation based on the ordinal scale relative weighting-rating technique. LHZ is then performed with chosen factor layers including: buffer map of thrusts, lithology, slope angle and relative relief calculated from DEM, NDVI, buffer map of drainage and Lineaments extracted from the digital satellite scene (TM). Then the Landslide Hazard Index (LHI) value is calculated and landslide hazard zonation is decided by slicing LHI histogram. The statistics demonstrate that High stable slope zone, Stable slope zone, Quasi-stable slope zone, Relatively unstable slope zone, Unstable slope zone and Defended slope zone account for 2.20%, 14.02%, 39.88%, 28.27%, 12.17% and 3.47% respectively. Then, GPS deformation control points on the landslide bodies are used to verify the validity of the LHZ technique.'

Abstract: 'AbstractRural drinking water supply is a persistent public health challenge in India, but with shifting contours. Pathogenic contamination of surface waters and water in shallow aquifers was sought to be addressed through massive tube-well programs in the 1980s and 1990s. However, chemical contamination of water in deeper aquifers is now widespread, often associated with irreversible public health damage, and is forcing yet another rethink.While government policies are still focused on the increasingly scarce \xe2\x80\x9calternative safe sources,\xe2\x80\x9d there is growing realization of the need to purify water for domestic consumption, even in rural areas. However, access to safe drinking water is largely seen as a government responsibility. But, barring Gujarat, large-scale rural drinking water schemes based on regional water supply have not materialized. Decentralized solutions face challenges of appropriate technology, management capacity, financing options, and environmental impacts.Models of public\xe2\x80\x93private partnerships, community-managed systems, and social enterprises have emerged under the circumstances. These models are explored, with the help of case studies, in this chapter to understand what needs to be done, and by whom, for a sustainable and scalable solution.'

Grounded in political ecology, the analysis will reveal narrow, simplistic understandings of culture as well as cultural biases in the environmental water management sector. It will discuss the consequences for minority groups seeking to have their water needs met and their distinct ontological perspectives on water recognized. In considering the implications, the responses and counterstrategies being articulated and deployed by indigenous groups and their supporters will be analyzed.'

Abstract: "AbstractIn the light of shortage of water in several parts of the World, especially in the developing country like India and in the context of the prevailing policy of accelerating growth through industrialization, there is an eminent need for devising newer approaches of water management. Various innovative successful approaches have been discussed which balanced societal priorities with feasible treatment technologies particularly focusing on natural treatment systems (NTS's). It has been argued that the NTS's can be effectively combined with advanced tertiary treatment alternatives and resulting high quality treated effluents can be gainfully recycled into production and sanitation applications. The dimensions of sustainability, stakeholder satisfaction, appropriate technologies, regulatory frameworks, governing institutions, and financial models have also been discussed."

URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110982316300722
Abstract: 'AbstractMetropolitan cities in India are emerging as major economic hubs with an unprecedented land use changes and decline of environmental resources. Globalisation and consequent relaxations of Indian markets to global players has given impetus to rapid urbanisation process. Urbanisation being irreversible and rapid coupled with fast growth of population during the last century, contributed to serious ecological and environmental consequences. This necessitates monitoring and advance visualisation of spatial patterns of landscape dynamics for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable development approaches. This study visualises the growth of Indian mega cities Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and Coimbatore, through Cellular Automata Markov model considering the influence of agent(s) of urban growth through soft computing techniques. CA Markov model is considered to be one of most effective algorithm to visualise the growth of urban spatial structures. Prediction of growth using agent based modelling considering the spatial patterns of urbanisation during the past four decades has provided insights to the urban dynamics. The industrial, infrastructural, socio-economic factors significantly influence the urban growth compared to the biophysical factors. Visualisation of urban growth suggest agents driven growth in the cities and its surroundings with large land use transformations in urban corridors and upcoming Industrial and ear marked developmental zones. Integrating local agents of urban growth help in identifying specific regions of intense growth, likely challenges and provide opportunities for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable cities during the 21st century.'

Abstract: 'Publisher SummaryThe tiger (Panthera tigris) originated in the landscape that is now China, and was widely distributed over Southeast Asia even about two million years ago. Although no historical data exist on tiger population sizes, old hunting records provide valuable insights into their abundance in the past. To save the tiger in remaining habitats, priority landscapes need to be identified where conservation efforts can be focused to secure breeding habitats connected by functional corridors. Poaching, both of prey and tigers, needs to be controlled. Programs to reduce the dependence of people on the surrounding wildlife habitats need to be promoted, and feral dogs that might kill wild ungulates and deter tigers need to be eliminated. There is increasing analytical sophistication and greater reliability in approaches to prioritize landscapes for global tiger conservation. The development of a synthetic toolbox of conservation approaches that draw on the social, economic, political, and institutional complexities of on-ground tiger conservation across various regions is an essential baseline for tiger conservation that is currently missing.'

Abstract: "SummaryThe malaria situation in India is complex as a result of diverse socio-environmental conditions. India contributes a substantial burden of malaria outside sub-Saharan Africa, with the third highest Plasmodium vivax prevalence in the world. Successful malaria control in India is likely to enhance malaria elimination efforts in the region. Despite modest gains, there are many challenges for malaria elimination in India, including: varied patterns of malaria transmission in different parts of the country demanding area-specific control measures; intense malaria transmission fuelled by favourable climatic and environment factors; varying degrees of insecticide resistance of vectors; antimalarial drug resistance; a weak surveillance system; and poor national coordination of state programmes. Prevention and protection against malaria are low as a result of a weak health-care system, as well as financial and socioeconomic constraints. Additionally, the open borders of India provide a potential route of entry for artesunate-resistant parasites from southeast Asia. This situation calls for urgent dialogue around tackling malaria across borders\xe2\x80\x94between India's states and neighbouring countries\xe2\x80\x94through sharing of information and coordinated control and preventive measures, if we are to achieve the aim of malaria elimination in the region."

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents the results of a sustainability analysis carried out for the evaluation of two participatory watershed projects in Kerala, South India. For a watershed project to be sustainable, four groups of criteria should be considered related to natural resources, technology, institutions and economics, respectively. Poor performance in each of these groups can jeopardise sustainability. The process is as strong as the weakest shackle in the chain. For a watershed project to be sustainable, all these groups should perform above a minimum standard. In both projects studied, the weakest shackle in the sustainability chain appears to be the economic sustainability of the projects. If one element fails, sustainability cannot be achieved.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Presents a political-industry model of illegal mining and deforestation in Goa.\xe2\x80\xa2Illegal extraction is influenced by political survival and conviction risks.\xe2\x80\xa2Effective deterrence exists only when both political and conviction risks are high.\xe2\x80\xa2When the regulator trades off one risk with another, illegal extraction increases.\xe2\x80\xa2High risk of political ouster could increase illegal mining and deforestation.AbstractMining of mineral resources entails significant deforestation in developing countries. The large financial rewards associated with mining create corrupt linkages between the government regulators and mining industry, often resulting in illegal extraction of minerals in environmentally sensitive areas. We develop a model of political-industry corrupted relationship to explore the problem of illegal mining of iron ore and its impact on deforestation in Goa, India. For the regulator, the decision to allow illegal extraction and relaxation from environmental remediation requirement is made with the objective of accumulating illegal wealth while simultaneously mitigating the risks of political ouster and conviction. Results suggest that several factors, such as the relative risks of political survival and conviction, the degree of impatience displayed by the regulator as well as the contribution of the mining sector to the economy, play a role in influencing the extent of illegal mining activity. When the regulator faces a low risk of political ouster, an increase in conviction risk may not provide enough deterrence to illegal mining, resulting in high levels of deforestation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe combined use of remote sensing and a distributed hydrological model have demonstrated the improved understanding of the entire water balance in an area where data are scarcely available. Water use and crop water productivity were assessed in the Upper Bhima catchment in southern India using an innovative integration of remotely sensed evapotranspiration and a process-based hydrological model. The remote sensing based Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to derive an 8 month time series of observed actual evapotranspiration from October 2004 to May 2005. This dataset was then used in the calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). This hydrological model was calibrated by changing 34 parameters to minimize the difference between simulated and observed actual evapotranspiration. The calibration efficiency was assessed with four different performance indicators. The calibrated model was used to derive a monthly basin water balance and to assess crop water productivity and crop water use for the irrigation year 2004\xe2\x80\x932005. It was found that evapotranspiration is the largest water loss in the catchment and total evaporative depletion was 38,172\xc2\xa0Mm3 (835\xc2\xa0mm). Of the total evaporative depletion 42% can be considered as non-beneficial and could be diverted to other beneficial utilization. Simulated crop water productivities for sugarcane, sorghum and winter wheat are relatively high at 2.9\xc2\xa0kg/m3, 1.3\xc2\xa0kg/m3 and 1.3\xc2\xa0kg/m3, respectively. The frequency distributions of crop water productivity are characterised by low coefficient of variation, yielding limited scope for improvement in the agricultural areas under the current cropping systems. Further improvements in water productivity may however be achieved by shifting the crop base from sugarcane to a dual crop and introducing a fallow period from March to May or by converting non-productive rangelands to bio fuel production or other agricultural land uses.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndia\xe2\x80\x99s growing population and economy generate an increasing demand for energy. Facing the decline of global fossil fuel resources, the Indian government and energy industry are considering the long-term expansion of biofuel production in order to increase energy security. This development leads to a strong competition of energy crops versus food crops for land and may result in an increasing pressure on natural resources. In a pilot scenario study, the LandSHIFT model is applied to assess the impact of biofuel production on land-use change in India up to the year 2030. The model aims at the spatially explicit simulation of land-use change and its relation to other global change processes on the national up to the global scale. It explicitly addresses competition between land-use activities such as human settlement, biofuel production and food production as well as the resulting effects on the spatial extent of natural land. Baseline of the study is a simulation with drivers from the \xe2\x80\x9cOrder from Strength\xe2\x80\x9d scenario of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. To illustrate the consequences of expanded biofuel production for the extent of natural land, we calculate three scenarios of bioethanol production to substitute 5%, 10% and 20% of the expected petrol demand in 2030. In the simulations shown, a comprehensive linkage is made between driving forces (such as population change) and policies (such as biofuel usage) that will affect land-use change over the coming decades.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe world population is expected to increase by a further three billion by 2050 and 90% of the three billion will be from developing countries that rely on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being of human kind. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85\xc2\xb0C (0.65\xe2\x80\x931.06\xc2\xb0C) over the period of 1880\xe2\x80\x932012. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year on record.Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4% of land and 4% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive pressure on natural resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6\xc2\xb0C, which is likely to impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased temperature, water stress, and reduction in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have been projected under medium-term (2020\xe2\x80\x9339) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by 4.5\xe2\x80\x939%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since agriculture currently contributes about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly range from 0.7% to 1.35% of GDP per year.Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers being smallholders (<0.5\xc2\xa0ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with changed climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion. Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops, fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening the livelihoods of rural poor.Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor, small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be over $7 billion that will severely affect the income of at least 10% of the population. However, this could be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective climate resilient measures are implemented.Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious and improved management of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources through adoption of best bet practices.CRA is a way to achieve short- and long-term agricultural development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes in order to meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience and the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change, and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) are referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9ctriple win\xe2\x80\x9d of overall CRA.The concept of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to provide stability to farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of CRVs warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and recover from climate risks.The overall program of establishing CRVs have structured village level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC), custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based on bottom-up approach with village community taking a central role in decision making on institutional requirements, technological interventions and supporting systems with able support from experts. In our knowledge, the CRV network of National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program involving farmer's participation ever undertaken in the field of climate change adaptation anywhere in the world.Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building of the program at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the district level, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under the Division of Agricultural Extension under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology divisions of various ICAR Institutions across the country are responsible in implementing the project at village level through farmers\xe2\x80\x99 participatory approach.To address the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages, different interventions were planned under the four modules; however, the specific intervention under each module for a particular village was need based and decided based on climatic vulnerability and resource situation of the particular village. The four intervention modules being implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, soil health card\xe2\x80\x93based nutrient application, water harvesting and recycling for supplementary or life saving irrigation, improved drainage in high rainfall/flood prone villages, conservation tillage, and water saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production module consisting of introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant varieties, modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops to cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of Rice Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in fruit/vegetables, community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in onset of monsoon, energy-efficient farm machinery through village CHC with timely completion of farm operation in limited sowing window, location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry systems. (3) Module III covers livestock and fisheries interventions through augmentation of fodder production, fodder storage methods, prophylaxis, and improved shelters for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy. (4) Module IV consists of village level institutions, collective marketing groups, introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate literacy though establishment of automated weather stations.Impacts of these climate resilient interventions in the villages were assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly, improved farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and measurements of GHG emissions which were correlated with ex ante assessment of village level carbon balance and overall contribution to global warming potential.These 151 CRVs are learning sites for further expanding resilient villages to adjoining clusters and districts so that large number of villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led climate change mitigation mission in the country."

Abstract: 'AbstractThe prospect of biofuels as a transport alternative fuel in Australia is reviewed and discussed in this paper. The Australian transport sector is the second largest energy consuming sector which consumes about 24% of total energy consumption. A part of this energy demand can be met by ecofriendly biofuels. A wide array of different biofuels feedstocks including Australian native species, their distributions, oil content, traditional uses are reviewed and listed in the descending order of their oil content. The world biofuel scenario as well as the 20 largest biofuel production countries and their mandates on biofuels blending with petroleum diesel are presented. Australia\xe2\x80\x99s biofuel production, consumption, production facilities and future investment projects are also reviewed and discussed. The study developed a biofuel supply chain for Australia and found that the second generation biofuels have better prospects as a future alternative transport fuel in Australia. These biofuel feedstocks are readily available and can overcome the shortcomings of the first generation biofuels, such as socio-economic, environmental and food versus land use challenges. Although some research is in progress, further study is needed on the process development of second generation biofuel production at commercial scale in Australia and abroad.'

Abstract: "SummaryAlthough definitions of mass gatherings (MG) vary greatly, they consist of large numbers of people attending an event at a specific site for a finite time. Examples of MGs include World Youth Day, the summer and winter Olympics, rock concerts, and political rallies. Some of the largest MGs are spiritual in nature. Among all MGs, the public health issues, associated with the Hajj (an annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) is clearly the best reported\xe2\x80\x94probably because of its international or even intercontinental implications in terms of the spread of infectious disease. Hajj routinely attracts 2\xc2\xb75 million Muslims for worship. WHO's global health initiatives have converged with Saudi Arabia's efforts to ensure the wellbeing of pilgrims, contain infectious diseases, and reinforce global health security through the management of the Hajj. Both initiatives emphasise the importance of MG health policies guided by sound evidence and based on experience and the timeliness of calls for a new academic science-based specialty of MG medicine."

Title: 'Research paperIndian monsoon variations during three contrasting climatic periods: The Holocene, Heinrich Stadial 2 and the last interglacial\xe2\x80\x93glacial transition'
Author: 'Coralie'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Long-term changes in Indian monsoon intensity and seasonality depend on insolation.\xe2\x80\xa2Strongest(weakest) Indian monsoon during the first part of the Holocene(HS 2).\xe2\x80\xa2Millennial-scale Indian monsoon variability punctuated the Holocene.\xe2\x80\xa2Weak Indian monsoon seasonality during moderate iceberg discharges at the MIS5/4.\xe2\x80\xa2Millennial-scale variability and intensity modulated by atmospheric teleconnections.AbstractIn contrast to the East Asian and African monsoons the Indian monsoon is still poorly documented throughout the last climatic cycle (last 135,000 years). Pollen analysis from two marine sediment cores (NGHP-01-16A and NGHP-01-19B) collected from the offshore Godavari and Mahanadi basins, both located in the Core Monsoon Zone (CMZ) reveals changes in Indian summer monsoon variability and intensity during three contrasting climatic periods: the Holocene, the Heinrich Stadial (HS) 2 and the Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 5/4 during the ice sheet growth transition. During the first part of the Holocene between 11,300 and 4200\xc2\xa0cal\xc2\xa0years BP, characterized by high insolation (minimum precession, maximum obliquity), the maximum extension of the coastal forest and mangrove reflects high monsoon rainfall. This climatic regime contrasts with that of the second phase of the Holocene, from 4200\xc2\xa0cal\xc2\xa0years BP to the present, marked by the development of drier vegetation in a context of low insolation (maximum precession, minimum obliquity). The historical period in India is characterized by an alternation of strong and weak monsoon centennial phases that may reflect the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, respectively. During the HS 2, a period of low insolation and extensive iceberg discharge in the North Atlantic Ocean, vegetation was dominated by grassland and dry flora indicating pronounced aridity as the result of a weak Indian summer monsoon. The MIS 5/4 glaciation, also associated with low insolation but moderate freshwater fluxes, was characterized by a weaker reduction of the Indian summer monsoon and a decrease of seasonal contrast as recorded by the expansion of dry vegetation and the development of Artemisia, respectively. Our results support model predictions suggesting that insolation changes control the long term trend of the Indian monsoon precipitation, but its millennial scale variability and intensity are instead modulated by atmospheric teleconnections to remote phenomena in the North Atlantic, Eurasia or the Indian Ocean.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The groundwater quality of Kadava River basin is analyzed.\xe2\x80\xa2The excessive nitrate content found in the groundwater samples.\xe2\x80\xa2Different ANN algorithms were adopted to predict nitrate content.\xe2\x80\xa2Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation algorithm found to be effective.\xe2\x80\xa2Neural networks are effective tool for prediction of water contaminants.AbstractAn attempt has been made to develop Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for prediction of nitrate concentration in groundwater of Kadava River basin, Nashik District, Maharashtra. The study area lies between longitude 73\xc2\xb055:74\xc2\xb015\xe2\x80\x99E and latitude 19\xc2\xb055\xe2\x80\x99:20\xc2\xb025\xe2\x80\x99N. River Kadava is one of the tributary of Godavari which originates in Sahyadri hills and flows towards NW to SE direction. Forty (40) representative groundwater samples were collected from dug/bore wells and analyzed for major cations and anions during pre and post monsoon seasons of 2012. Physicochemical results confirm that, 67.50% and 75% of groundwater samples having NO3 concentration beyond the permissible limit of the BIS (>45\xc2\xa0mg/L) in both the seasons. The spatiotemporal analysis inferred that, nitrate prone areas located in North and Central part of the study area, may be due to intense agriculture and overuse of nitrogen rich fertilizers and natural processes viz., dissolution, percolation and leaching. The consumption of high nitrate containing water is harmful to human health; consequently, it reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and in infant causes methemoglobinemia. In view of this the assessment and prediction of groundwater quality is an essential to predict the nitrate content to avoid future consequences, therefore there is need to develop a consistent, precise and resilient predictive model. The present study utilizes the algorithms viz., Levenberg - Marquardt three layer back propagation, traditional back propagation algorithm, resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm, smallest absolute derivative (sag) and smallest learning rate (slr) for nitrate prediction. The Levenberg - Marquardt three layer back-propagation algorithm was found effective with 7 and 8 input neurons for pre and post monsoon season; 6 hidden neurons and nitrate content as a output variable. The efficiency of model is validated through coefficient of determination (R2), Residual Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) values. The present model gives satisfactory results and confirms consistent acceptable performance in both the seasons. The proposed ANN model may be helpful for similar studies and will be helpful to local public health bodies and policy makers to develop the management strategies.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (269KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Role of groundwater in buffering irrigation production against climate variability at the basin scale in South-West India'
Author: 'Paul'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377411002915
Abstract: "AbstractThe basaltic aquifers of the Upper Bhima River Basin in India are highly utilized for irrigation but the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals and the agricultural production systems they support is largely unknown. Here we used hydrogeological data, supported by secondary data, to assess the effects of water scarcity over a decade-long period (1998\xe2\x80\x932007) on the groundwater resources at the regional basin scale. This reveals no evidence of systematic declines in total groundwater availability over the period; only shorter-term losses/gains in storage associated with successive dry/wet years. The clearest indicator of stress comes from the more widespread drying out of wells following lower rainfall years throughout the basin and especially in upland areas where aquifers are least developed and most easily drained. Groundwater in the basin offers an adaptive mechanism to climate variability to some degree, but the buffering capacity is constrained by low aquifer storativity and average residence times of just a few years. Around 40% of the basin is currently at a level of development that is of concern, and the number of irrigation wells is growing rapidly. However recent evidence of conversion from high to low water use crops indicates the adaptive capacity of farmers to water-related stresses. Surplus surface water flows may provide opportunities to enhance groundwater recharge but requires careful trade-off analysis of the downstream impacts.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba No systematic decline in groundwater levels observed over the past decade. \xe2\x96\xba The transient nature of groundwater stresses in India's basaltic aquifers revealed. \xe2\x96\xba The buffering capacity of groundwater to poor rainfall is important but limited to no more than a few years. \xe2\x96\xba Increased groundwater infrastructure translates to greater abstraction, but not necessarily in direct proportion."

Title: 'The social connectivity of urban rivers'
Author: 'G. Mathias'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X16308650
Abstract: "AbstractBy social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other rivers for hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation.The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of \xe2\x80\x98closeness\xe2\x80\x99 of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15\xc2\xa0m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers ~\xc2\xa050 to ~\xc2\xa0200\xc2\xa0m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a \xe2\x80\x98lively\xe2\x80\x99 atmosphere. At widths over ~\xc2\xa0200\xc2\xa0m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaking in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity.In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile."

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Water quality parameters were tested to find out the current salinity condition.\xe2\x80\xa2Spatial mapping of saline water quality parameters was plotted using GIS.\xe2\x80\xa2Examined people's perception and the adaptation measures to cope with water crisis.\xe2\x80\xa2An integrated community based model was proposed to combat drinking water scarcity.AbstractSafe drinking water scarcity is an acute problem in the coastal regions of Bangladesh which is mainly caused by salinity intrusion. In this context, drinking water sources are severely affected, including adverse effects on agriculture, health, fisheries and the ecosystem. This research investigates i) selected water quality parameters ii) local people's perception on drinking water scarcity iii) how local people's cope with safe drinking water scarcity. This research was conducted using local water samples, questionnaire survey of 200 households and 4 focus group discussions (FDGs) in Shyamnagar and Tala sub-district of Satkhira district. The study of the water quality parameters exposed the extreme conditions of the drinking water sources in the area. The average values of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC) and Chloride concentration (Cl\xe2\x88\x92) were found respectively 4044.12\xc2\xa0mg/L, 7186.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcS/cm, and 3143.6\xc2\xa0mg/L in Shyamnagar and 2313.60\xc2\xa0mg/L, 4390.3\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcS/cm, and 1402.1\xc2\xa0mg/L in Tala. The result of community perception reveals that local people are aware of the safe water scarcity and nearly all of them perceive that salinity is the main reason behind it. Even though there are a number of socioeconomic factors, communities have their own adaptation technologies to cope with the problem. The study concludes with the development of a community based model defining the key responsibilities of the stakeholders, including local and central government, NGOs and community people to work in a well-coordinated manner which will be effective for reducing the scarcity of the safe drinking water."

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2First regional study covering long-term changes in forests of South Asia since 1930\xe2\x80\xa2Assessed spatial distribution of land cover\xe2\x80\xa2Analyzed net and gross rate of deforestation across the countries\xe2\x80\xa2Quantified influence of deforestation on spatial patterns of fragmentation\xe2\x80\xa2This study indicates increased measures of conservation in recent decade.AbstractThe present study, first of its kind, has analyzed the land cover and investigated the spatial patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation in South Asian region since the 1930's. This region comprises of eight countries: India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. In South Asia, agricultural land is predominant constituting 43% of the total geographical area followed by barren land (19.99%) and forests (14.72%). The long-term change analysis using the classified maps of 1930 and 2014 indicated a loss of 29.62% of the forest cover. Higher annual net deforestation rates were observed in the period from 1930\xe2\x80\x931975 (0.68%) followed by 1975\xe2\x80\x931985 (0.23%), 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 (0.12%), 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 (0.06%) and 2005\xe2\x80\x932014 (0.04%) for the region. Forest fragmentation had significant spatio-temporal variation across the South Asian countries. In 1930, 88.91% of the South Asian forest was classified as large core forest, 8.18% as edge forest and 1.18% as perforated forest. The large core forest category has decreased significantly in area over last eight decades. The results of the present study are expected to serve as a reference for the evaluation of globally agreed Aichi biodiversity target 5 for South Asian countries. This study will be a valuable basis for developing management strategies and restoration programs as it tracks the spatial changes in deforestation and forest fragmentation."

Title: 'Comparing statistically downscaled simulations of Indian monsoon at different spatial resolutions'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Statistical downscaling of ISMR at multiple spatial resolutions.\xe2\x80\xa2Comparison of skill scores of downscaled projections at different resolutions.\xe2\x80\xa2Changes in multi-model uncertainty with lead time and resolution.\xe2\x80\xa2No significant change in signal to noise ratio with the change in resolutions.SummaryImpacts of climate change are typically assessed with fairly coarse resolution General Circulation Models (GCMs), which are unable to resolve local scale features that are critical to precipitation variability. GCM simulations must be downscaled to finer resolutions, through statistical or dynamic modelling for further use in hydrologic analysis. In this study, we use a linear regression based statistical downscaling method for obtaining monthly Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) projections at multiple spatial resolutions, viz., 0.05\xc2\xb0, 0.25\xc2\xb0 and 0.50\xc2\xb0, and compare them. We use 19 GCMs of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) suite and combine them with multi model averaging and Bayesian model averaging. We find spatially non-uniform changes in projections at all resolutions for both combinations of projections. Our results show that the changes in the mean for future time periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) at different resolutions, viz., 0.05\xc2\xb0, 0.25\xc2\xb0 and 0.5\xc2\xb0, obtained with both Multi-Model Average (MMA) and Bayesian Multi-Model Average (BMA) are comparable. We also find that the model uncertainty decreases with projection times into the future for all resolutions. We compute Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), which represents the climate change signal in simulations with respect to the noise arising from multi-model uncertainty. This appears to be almost similar at different resolutions. The present study highlight that, a mere increase in resolution by a way of computationally more expensive statistical downscaling does not necessarily contribute towards improving the signal strength. Denser data networks and finer resolution GCMs may be essential for producing usable rainfall and hydrologic information at finer resolutions in the context of statistical downscaling.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe rising economic activities, growing population and improving living standards of world have led to a steady growth in its appetite for quality and quantity of energy services. As the economy expands the electricity demand is going to grow further, increasing the challenges of the more generation and stresses on the utility grids. Appropriate energy model will help in proper utilization of the locally available renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass, small hydro etc. to integrate in the available grid, reducing the investments in energy infrastructure. Further to these new technologies like smart grids, decentralized energy planning, energy management practices, energy efficiency are emerging. In this paper the attempt has been made to study and review the recent energy planning models, energy forecasting models, and renewable energy integration models. Also various modeling techniques and tools are reviewed and discussed.'

Abstract: "The first hydropower plant in Karnataka state, India, was set up at Shivanasamudram in 1902. Gradually, the capacities of hydropower plants became very large due to increased electricity demand. Large-scale hydroelectric plants now contribute significantly to meeting the state's and the nation's demand for electricity. Most of Karnataka's hydroelectric plants are located in Uttara Kannada district. Construction of large reservoirs is restricted due to environmental constraints and necessitates the development of ecologically sound alternatives to cater for the needs of the region. The planning of water resources depends on type and size of projects, the ecological factors involved, etc. Emphasis is placed on presenting an overview of water resources through meteorological, hydrological, ecological and economic data. Economic data includes all costs and benefits, specifically hitherto underestimated, environmental social costs and benefits. This study was carried out in Bedthi and Aghnashini rivers in Uttara Kannada district of the Western Ghats region, Karnataka state, India. An estimated 720 and 510 million kWh of electricity can be generated in Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins if all the streams are harnessed. Focusing on land submergence impact, a model is proposed to minimize submergence and maximize net energy in a region, with seasonal power generation, reservoir storage capacity (so as to meet the region's demand during all seasons) and installed generation capacity as the decision variables. Net energy analyses incorporating biomass energy lost in submergence show that maximization in net energy at a site is possible, if the hydroelectric generation capacity is adjusted according to the seasonal variations in the river's water discharge. A decision support system (DSS) used in water resource planning for electricity generation is discussed in this paper."

Abstract: 'AbstractSoil is an important natural resource that requires crucial attention due to its significant role in crop yield. There is substantial ongoing research on soil health, particularly its water retention capability, moisture content, salinity, temperature, pH, concentration of dissolved gases, etc. Technologies have evolved that can remotely monitor soil and track its various parameters without being physically present in the field, using various probes (coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometry sensors, frequency domain reflectometry sensors, time domain reflectometry sensors, gypsum blocks, neutron probes, etc.). These probes are extremely accurate and provide information about the soil\xe2\x80\x99s surface as well as its inner layers with respect to moisture content, salinity, and temperature. Thus, the probes are helpful for farmers in increasing crop yield by adopting an optimum level of irrigation and suitable fertilizers. The usage of soil probes would be helpful for the economical use of water, as well as of chemical fertilizers to subsequently reduce their toxicity to growing crops. Research scientists studying earth and its environmental processes are always keen to know the processes going on inside the soil. These soil sensors buried in different soil horizons are able to provide complete information to scientists\xe2\x80\x99 lab desktops, even without going to the topographical location. These soil probes are kept intact within the soil with no gaps between the soil and probes to obtain an accurate picture of the soil environment. However, the most tedious aspect is to select the right sensor based on the type of soil and the precision required. This chapter details recent developments on soil sensors, data analysis obtained, and their applications in fields, as well as their shortcomings, if any.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Wind resource maps at 10\xe2\x80\xafm and 80\xe2\x80\xafm (a.g.l) were revised and updated.\xe2\x80\xa2Sensitivity of the wind potential to the data time period was highlighted.\xe2\x80\xa2Wind farm feasibility was assessed according to the international standards of NREL.\xe2\x80\xa2Optimal windy site analyses using GIS method were performed.\xe2\x80\xa2Draw an investment outline for wind farm installation projects in Algeria.AbstractThe Algerian government has established an attractive policy to encourage investment in the wind energy by installing 5\xe2\x80\xafGW of wind power by 2030. It has focused on collaborations and calls for investment from outside wind energy companies. However, this energy sector development requires the identification of potentially windy sites. This study was performed in order to determine new optimal sites in Algeria that may be eligible to receive the wind farm projects. Therefore, data from about 74 new sites were identified and assimilated to verify and update the wind resource estimates. Hourly wind speeds data were used for the establishment of the annual and seasonal wind maps at 10\xe2\x80\xafm and 80\xe2\x80\xafm a.g.l. As the wind map updates highlighted important changes in the wind resource, the wind potential sensitivity to the data time period was evaluated. The windy sites were classed on the basis of the NREL international standards. However, In order to ensure an adequate return on investment, the other objective of this study was to identify the optimal sites using a multi-criteria analysis based on the GIS method. Considering additional factors as network availability and wind energy previsions, different strategic scenarios of wind farms planning were proposed.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe conservation challenges facing mega-biodiverse South and Southeast Asia in the 21st century are enormous. For millennia, much of the habitat of these regions was only lightly modified by human endeavour, yet now it is experiencing rampant deforestation, logging, biofuel cropping, invasive species expansion, and the synergies of climate change, drought, fire and sea-level rise. Although small-scale conservation management might assist some species and habitats, the broader sweep of problems requires big thinking and some radical solutions. Given the long expected lead times between progressive economic development and stabilization of human population size and consumption rates, we argue that \xe2\x80\x98technological fixes\xe2\x80\x99 cannot be ignored if we are to address social and fiscal drivers of environmental degradation and associated species extinctions in rapidly developing regions like southern Asia. The pursuit of cheap and abundant \xe2\x80\x98clean\xe2\x80\x99 energy from an economically rational mix of nuclear power, geothermal, solar, wind, and hydrogen-derivative \xe2\x80\x98synfuels\xe2\x80\x99, is fundamental to this goal. This will permit pathways of high-tech economic development that include intensified (high energy-input) agriculture over small land areas, full recycling of material goods, a transition from fossil-fuel use for transport and electricity generation, a rejection of tropical biofuels that require vast areas of arable land for production, and a viable alternative to the damming of major waterways like the Mekong, Murum and northern tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers for hydroelectricity. Rational approaches that work at large scales must be used to deal with the ultimate, rather than just proximate, drivers of biodiversity loss in the rapidly developing regions of southern Asia.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Conservation challenges in southern Asia in the 21st century are enormous. \xe2\x96\xba Historical threats like habitat loss are being compounded by affluence growth. \xe2\x96\xba A BAU fossil-fuel-intensive economic route will lead to further major damages. \xe2\x96\xba Energy innovation a major route to avoiding depletion of natural resources. \xe2\x96\xba Must \xe2\x80\x98think big\xe2\x80\x99 and embrace techno-fixes in addition to invoking societal change.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWater is the most abundant and essential resource in India. At present, the quality of water resources is one of the most critical environmental challenges from the national perspective. Increasing population coupled with rapid urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural growth has resulted in the deterioration of water quality in the country. The available water resources in many parts of the country are becoming polluted because of the discharge of untreated sewage, industrial effluents, etc. This pressing situation demands a solution to improve the quality of water resources in the country through water quality management strategies.'

Title: 'Geomorphic characterization and diversity of the fluvial systems of the Gangetic Plains'
Author: 'R.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X05000735
Abstract: 'AbstractThe extensive Gangetic alluvial plains are drained by rivers which differ strongly in terms of hydrological and sediment transport characteristics. These differences are manifested in the geomorphic diversity of the plains. The Western Gangetic Plains (WGP) are marked by a degradational topography with incised channels and extensive badland development in some parts, while the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) are characterized by shallow, aggrading channels with frequent avulsions and extensive flooding. We interpret such geomorphic diversity in terms of differences in stream power and sediment supply from the catchment areas. The rivers draining the western plains are marked by higher stream power and lower sediment yield that result in degradation. In comparison, the rivers draining the eastern Gangetic Plains have lower stream power and higher sediment yield that result in aggradation. The variation of stream power, a function of channel slope and high sediment yield, is attributed to differences in rainfall and rate of uplift in the hinterland. It is suggested that such differences have resulted in a marked geomorphic diversity across the plains. It is also suggested that such diversity has existed for a fairly long time because of climatic and tectonic variance.'

Author: 'Travis J.'

Abstract: "AbstractThis article uses the seemingly promising case of Morocco's argan oil to assess the value of patent disclosure requirements (PDRs) as a policy instrument aimed at improving the sharing of biodiversity benefits. After introducing the disclosure requirements debate and discussing relevant features of the argan oil case, I construct a simple counterfactual by asking: \xe2\x80\x9cHow would PDRs have changed benefit sharing in the argan oil case?\xe2\x80\x9d From this case, three practical considerations emerge that shed a realistic, if cautious, light on the marginal value of PDRs as a benefit sharing mechanism: (1) PDRs require an accompanying national biodiversity regime but their relative value is inversely proportional to regime strength (2) PDRs should be assessed based on the additional compliance incentives they provide and median, not blockbuster, patent values and (3) the alternative to no PDRs and no regime is not zero benefits. While these considerations are inherently country-specific, PDRs should generally be assessed at the margin rather than in vague conceptual and aggregate ways."

Title: 'Biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires in the Deccan Plateau, India'
Author: 'V. Krishna'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479706003756
Abstract: 'AbstractForest fires constitute one of the most serious environmental problems in several forested regions of India. In the Indian sub-continent, relatively few studies have focused on the assessment of biophysical and anthropogenic controls of forest fires at a landscape scale and the spatial aspects of these relationships. In this study, we used fire count data sets from satellite remote sensing data covering 78 districts over four different states of the Deccan Plateau, India, for assessing the underlying causes of fires. Spatial data for explanatory variables of fires pertaining to topography, vegetation, climate, anthropogenic and accessibility factors have been gathered corresponding with fire presence/absence. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of the presence of fires as a function of the explanatory variables. Results for fire area estimates suggested that, of the total fires covering 47,043km2 that occurred during the year 2000 for the entire Indian region, 29.0% occurred in the Deccan Plateau, with Andhra Pradesh having 13.5%, Karnataka 14.7%, Kerala 0.1%, and Tamilnadu 1.15%. Results from the logistic regression suggest that the strongest influences on the fire occurrences were the amount of forest area, biomass densities, rural population density (PD), average precipitation of the warmest quarter, elevation (ELE) and mean annual temperature (MAT). Among these variables, biomass density (BD) and average precipitation of the warmest quarter had the highest significance, followed by others. These results on the best predictors of forest fires can be used both as a strategic planning tool to address broad scale fire risk concerns, and also as a tactical guide to help forest managers to design fire mitigation measures at the district level.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We modelled long-term drivers of Australian fur seal entanglement rates.\xe2\x80\xa2Applying GAMM models also allowed the estimation of total entanglements per year.\xe2\x80\xa2Observer effort was a stronger driver than fishing intensity and population size.\xe2\x80\xa2More pups were entangled as they approached weaning each year.\xe2\x80\xa2Estimated annual rates were an order of magnitude higher than observed rates.AbstractMethods of calculating wildlife entanglement rates are not standardised between studies and often ignore the influence of observer effort, confounding comparisons. From 1997\xe2\x80\x932013 we identified 359 entangled Australian fur seals at Seal Rocks, south-eastern Australia. Most entanglement materials originated from commercial fisheries; most frequently entangling pups and juveniles. Using Generalized Additive Mixed Models, which incorporated observer effort and survey frequency, we identified that entanglements were observed more frequently amongst pups from July to October as they approached weaning. Neither the decline in regional fishing intensity nor changing seal population size influenced the incidence of entanglements. Using the models, we estimated that 302 (95% CI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0182\xe2\x80\x93510) entangled seals were at Seal Rocks each year, equivalent to 1.0% (CI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.6\xe2\x80\x931.7%) of the site population. This study highlights the influence of observer effort and the value of long-term datasets for determining the drivers of marine debris entanglements.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe paper focuses on a method of detecting and monitoring vegetation health in near-real time using freely available remote sensed satellite data and open source tools. Unhealthy vegetation condition can be interpreted as a signal to indicate the onset of drought. Recently Northern Kerala has been experiencing an increasing number of drought incidents due to weather anomalies and developmental pressures resulting in economic losses. Early detection of drought and dissemination of this information can help the State machinery to take necessary steps to mitigate drought impacts. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) image is generated from the AOI (Area of Interest) satellite images obtained in the NIR and Red band. Satellite images captured by Terra satellite were uploaded in the internet ftp server within 24\xc2\xa0hours. The uploaded satellite data is searched and automatically downloaded using web services by the software application developed and processed, within 10-30\xc2\xa0minutes. The process include generation of NDVI by an algorithm and the application automatically updates the recent NDVI map in the Web Server and is uploaded in the Intranet Web Server using open source software. The latest NDVI image map thus generated can be viewed through web browser in the organization intranet. Thus the Vegetation Health status of a day can be monitored the following day. Since the vegetation health do not change significantly overnight this can be considered as Near Real Time Monitoring with respect to Vegetation health. This map can be downloaded by potential users and analyzed according to the spatial area of interest.'

Author: 'Iyyappan'

Abstract: 'AbstractBiological diversity refers to the variety and variability among living organisms and the ecological complexes in which they occur. The loss of biodiversity is important because human existence depends on the biological resources and it is the essential component of several ecosystems. The natural resources are over exploited in many of the tropical islands in spite of fragile ecosystem to meet growing rural poverty and strive for economic growth. All these factors together with climate change are responsible for the extinction or threatened status of a number of species. In many of the tropical islands, loss of genetically distinct and unique species is due to human-induced selective pressures. Consequently, there has been a growing realization that the conventional method of conservation is no more effective in dealing with the socio-ecological complexity and political dimensions of biodiversity conservation. By conserving biodiversity, we not only ensure that our surroundings are richer and more diverse, but also we secure the resources that will continue to provide improvements in the quality of human life.'

Meteorological data was collected by mobile surveys under clear sky weather days in monsoon and winter months of 2014 using two HOBO data loggers installed on a vehicle along the routes which covered many parts of Delhi intersecting vertical and horizontal transects capturing different land use patterns of the city. UHI values obtained through interpolation were validated with UHI obtained from temperature measurements at five fixed sites spread over the Delhi region, which were found in good agreement (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.91). The variability existing in the two seasons studied has been shown by low UHI values obtained in the monsoon season and high UHI values in winter season. The diurnal pattern of UHI showed higher UHI during the nighttime period, compared to morning and noon periods. The results show variable UHI in different regions of Delhi covered by mobile routes with high UHI values of >6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C observed during the winter period.'

The metal concentrations varied significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) among the fish species with maximum and minimum accumulation of Zn (46.47\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g) and Cd (0.25\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g), respectively. The fishes captured during summer accumulated a higher amount of metals relative to other seasons, which was attributed to a higher influx of agricultural waste, sewage and sludge by heavy rainfall and floods. According to estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), total target hazard quotient (TTHQ), and the permissible safety limits prescribed by various agencies, consumption of the examined fish species should be considered as safe for human health. However, the estimation of carcinogenic risk (CR\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x925) due to exposure to arsenic indicated that consumers remain at risk of cancer.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper deals with participatory research on the introduction and use of coir geotextiles for soil and water conservation in a small community pond in a watershed in south India. The results demonstrate that a participatory approach enables the community to visualize and evaluate the impact of innovative technologies. As a result, farmers readily adapt a technology when they have experienced the positive research outcome. This reduces the adoption time, and can bring significant increase in yield, or decrease in labour costs, helping to enhance productivity, sustainability and improvement of livelihood.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We identified the factors that give rise to greater or lesser adaptive capacity among households.\xe2\x80\xa2We examine different adaptation actions among farmers and its determinants.\xe2\x80\xa2Many indicators, while increasing the likelihood that one adaptation would be taken, also decreased the likelihood that another would be taken.\xe2\x80\xa2The results suggest that further attention to crop insurance may be warranted.\xe2\x80\xa2Caution is warranted in terms of the assumptions that we make about differential adaptive capacity.AbstractUnderstanding the factors that give rise to greater or lesser adaptive capacity among households with in a community could allow government interventions to target the right groups of people. In this paper we study such factors, making use of a household survey administered in the Indian state of Odisha. In the survey, we queried respondents for the adaptations that they had engaged in to deal with the risk of drought, as well as a number of indicators for adaptive capacity taken from the literature. We found a large number of indicators of adaptive capacity to correlate with one or more adaptations taken. However, many of these indicators, while increasing the likelihood that one adaptation would be taken, also decreased the likelihood that another would be taken, and hence were not unambiguous determinants of greater adaptive capacity in general. One indicator, access to crop insurance, stood out as particularly effective: it correlated with an increased likelihood of engaging in two separate yield-raising adaptations, and correlated with a decreased likelihood of engaging in two additional adaptations that would have the effect of reducing yields. The results suggest that further attention to crop insurance may be warranted, as well as further research to determine if the other indicators may be effective in other contextual settings.'

Title: 'What explains investment-resource gap in wind power technology in India? Testing for the relevance of local factors\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractWorldwide, a disparity in utilization of wind resource is observed. Often, regions endowed with higher wind potential tend to receive fewer investments than those with lower potential. This study is aimed at identifying factors that result in such a skewed diffusion of wind power technology (WPT). These factors are identified by conducting a case study for a State in India - Maharashtra. The State is chosen as there is no correlation between wind potential in a district and corresponding WPT installed capacity. Only five districts (out of nine districts endowed with significant wind potential) comprising less than 50 per cent of the potential contribute more than 90 per cent of the capacity. Accordingly, this paper is an enquiry into role of local factors influencing the adoption of WPT. Five factors are identified through semi-structured interviews with six firms contributing to over 50 per cent of the installed capacity of WPT in Maharashtra. Subsequently, validation of the factors is carried out through econometric analysis using the data for nine districts of the state for the period 2006\xe2\x80\x932013. Results show that four factors \xe2\x80\x93 namely, geographical, technological, societal, and bureaucratic influence the decision of firms to invest in WPT.'

Title: 'Interactions between protected areas and their surroundings in human-dominated tropical landscapes'

Abstract: 'AbstractProtected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a \xe2\x80\x9czone of interaction\xe2\x80\x9d (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs \xe2\x80\x93 Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole \xe2\x80\x93 using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha\xe2\x80\x99s ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.'

Abstract: 'AbstractEnergy is a vital component of any society playing a pivotal role in the development. Post oil crises shifted the focus of energy planners towards renewable resources and energy conservation. Biomass is one such renewable, which accounts for nearly 33% of a developing country\xe2\x80\x99s energy needs. In India, it meets about 75% of the rural energy needs. In Karnataka, non-commercial energy sources like firewood, agricultural residues, charcoal and cow dung account for 53.2%. The energy released by the reaction of organic carbon (of bioresources) with oxygen is referred to as bioenergy. Bioresource availability is highly diversified and it depends on the region\xe2\x80\x99s agroclimatic conditions. Inventorying of these resources is required for describing the quality, quantity, change, productivity, condition of bioresources and requirement in a given area. The present study assesses bioresource status across the agroclimatic zones of Karnataka, considering the bioenergy availability (from agriculture, horticulture, forests and plantations) and sector-wise energy demand (domestic, agriculture, industry, etc.).Bioresource availability is computed based on the compilation of data on the area and productivity of agriculture and horticulture crops, forests and plantations. Sector-wise energy demand is computed based on the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO study) data, primary survey data and from the literature. Using the data of bioresource availability and demand, bioresource status is computed for all the agroclimatic zones. The ratio of bioresource availability to demand gives the bioresource status. The ratio greater than one indicates bioresource surplus zones, while a ratio less than one indicates scarcity.The study reveals that the central dry zone (1.4), the hilly zone (3.79), the southern transition zone (3.12) and the coastal zone (3.40) are bioresource surplus zones, whereas the northeastern transition zone (0.48), northeastern dry zone (0.23), northern dry zone (0.58), eastern dry zone (0.39), southern dry zone (0.93) and northern transition zone (0.45) come under bioresource-deficient zones. Among the bioresource surplus zones, horticulture residues contribute significantly towards bioenergy in the central dry zone, southern transition zone and the coastal zone, while in the hilly zone the main contributor of bioenergy are agricultural residues. Amidst the bioresource-deficient zones, agriculture is the major contributor of bioenergy in the northeastern transition zone (52%), northern dry zone (59%), and northern transition zone. Based on the bioenergy status of the zones and land use pattern, feasible management and technical options have been discussed, which help in optimising the available bioenergy and in building a sustainable energy society. This study also explores various programmes that can be initiated and implemented like social, community and joint forest management involving public participation. Such schemes will lessen the burden on the existing resources and also help the rural masses to procure biomass on a sustained basis.'

Abstract: "AbstractIn the continuing race between man and nature, the ecological balance has been upset. It is becoming increasingly important for the Indian people to combat the danger inherent in the growing deterioration of the natural environment, the degradation of land, poisoning of the air, rivers and reservoirs and the pollution of cities. A third of India's potential agricultural land and three-fourths of the non-agricultural land is lying practically useless. Besides, three-fifths of our total agricultural land is degraded and, on the whole, three-quarters of all the land under cultivation and in forests needs urgent care. Such a state of affairs is partly due to the poverty and overpopulation in our country, and is partly because of complacency, ignorance and lack of policy and organisation at the highest levels. It is a sad but undeniable fact that our forest departments have, by and large, failed to protect our 70 odd million hectares of forest lands against encroachments, unauthorised felling and denudation. It is estimated that 6,000 million tonnes of top soil are displaced every monsoon season by water erosion. The environment has begun to show obvious signs of the misuse of our natural envirnoment. A classic example of this is the entire exercise in flood control in the Ganga basin. The silent valley controversy in Kerala focussed the nation's attention on the plight of the tropical evergreen forests. Silted-up reservoirs no longer have their original capacity."

Abstract: 'AbstractAggregating and forecasting demand are crucial parts of energy planning. While a large number of energy consumption surveys have been conducted in the past in the rural energy sector of India, the lack of sufficient data and its compilation, coupled with doubt about the quality of data, has made the task extremely difficult. This paper summarizes our recent effort to compile, computerize and analyze data from 638 village energy consumption surveys covering over 39,000 households, carried out by different organisations between 1985 and 1989. The details of the level of information provided in the survey reports, area of survey, land use pattern, asset ownership, etc., of the collated studies are presented. Results based on the analysis of the energy consumption data compiled are then discussed. The national average for rural domestic thermal energy consumption (excluding water and space heating) estimated through this work (629 kcal or 2.63 MJ per capita daily) is much similar to the rural domestic thermal energy requirement assumed in most energy planning exercises in India in the past. The useful thermal energy consumption varies from 325 to 1065 kcal/cap/d (1.36\xe2\x80\x934.46 MJ/cap/d) in the East Coast Plain and Hills and the Eastern Himalayan Regions, respectively. Reconfirming the predominance of firewood, the data reveals that the contribution of firewood to the domestic thermal energy consumption has remained at about 58% over the last three decades; dungcake and agricultural residues contribute almost equally in the remaining share. At the national level, our estimates indicate that at least 180 million tonnes of firewood, 40 million tonnes of dungcakes and 30 million tonnes of agricultural residues were consumed in the rural sector for meeting the domestic thermal energy requirement in 1991. The paper also compares the estimates with those based on other surveys in India.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Agricultural zoning can mitigate the impacts of biofuels crops expansion.\xe2\x80\xa2Wildlife-friendly techniques can improve biodiversity in biofuels crops dominated landscapes.\xe2\x80\xa2Long-term biodiversity monitoring programs should include agricultural landscapes.AbstractThe use of biofuels can result on a decrease of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when compared to fossil fuels. However, the expansion of biofuels crops has been either based on direct or indirect displacement of natural ecosystems or on the use of degraded or marginal lands. The former results in direct habitat loss, whereas the later results in usual agricultural impacts (e.g., soil and biotic contamination and water eutrophication). However, in some circumstances biofuels crops can result on an increase in biodiversity compared to other agricultural crops. Agricultural zoning can mitigate the impacts of land use change (LUC), either direct (dLUC) or indirect (iLUC), whereas the use of wildlife-friendly techniques can mitigate the impacts of agriculture intensification. However, in both cases long-term biodiversity monitoring programs should be established in order to help the decision making process concerning the conflict between the expansion of biofuels crops and the conservation of biodiversity.'

These wetlands provide numerous ecological goods and services but are under tremendous stress due to rapid urbanization, industrialization and agricultural intensification, manifested by the shrinkage in their areal extent, and decline in the hydrological, economic and ecological functions they perform. This paper reviews the wetland wealth of India in terms of their geographic distribution and extent, ecosystem benefits they provide, and the various stresses they are exposed to. The paper also discusses the efforts at management of these fragile ecosystems, identifies the institutional vacuum and suggests priority area where immediate attention is required in order to formulate better conservation strategies for these productive systems.New hydrological insights for the regionIt has been found that management of wetlands has received inadequate attention in the national water sector agenda. As a result, many of the wetlands are subject to anthropogenic pressures, including land use changes in the catchment; pollution from industry and households; encroachments; tourism; and over exploitation of their natural resources. Further, majority of research on wetland management in India relates to the limnological aspects and ecological/environmental economics of wetland management. But, the physical (such as hydrological and land use changes in the catchment) and socio-economic processes leading to limnological changes have not been explored substantially.'

Abstract: 'AbstractStudy regionBhadra basin (1968\xc2\xa0km2), located in peninsular India, is considered for demonstration.Study focusA general framework to assess the impact of climate change on the pattern of daily extreme streamflow events is proposed. Whereas, the impact is confirmed in the recent literature for most of the hydrologic variables at monthly/seasonal time scale, assessment and quantification at finer time scale, e.g. daily, is challenging. Complexity increases for the derived hydrologic variables, such as soil moisture and streamflow as compared to primary hydrologic variables, such as precipitation. The proposed general framework is demonstrated with the daily inflow to the Bhadra reservoir. Different statistical limits of extremes are defined and change in daily extreme pattern (number and magnitude) in the future (2006\xe2\x80\x932035) is assessed with respect to the baseline period (1971\xe2\x80\x932000).New hydrological insights for the regionDemonstration of the proposed methodology with the inflow to Bhadra reservoir reveals that the daily extreme events are expected to increase in number with the increase in the threshold of the extreme. For a particular threshold, the average magnitude of the extreme events in the future is found to be higher as compared to the baseline period. However, for monthly totals the case is not the same \xe2\x88\x92 it remains almost similar. The methodology, being general in nature, can be applied to other locations in order to assess the future change in streamflow and other derived variables.'

The regional and industry contexts for CP are demonstrated by outlining the interaction and interdependency between the urban and rural environment, and an industry cluster centered on Tirupur City. A policy for fostering water use productivity in the industry cluster is discussed, which shows how that in order for resource productivity to be maintained, regional and industry CP strategies should be aligned. This is illustrated by a discussion on CP lessons in water and chemicals conservation. The paper also recommends future areas of CP investigations required in the industry to make it ecologically sustainable in the long-term.'

Recent studies predict severe climate change impacts on Coffea arabica (C. arabica) production. However, quantitative production figures are necessary to provide coffee stakeholders and policy makers with evidence to justify immediate action. Using data from the northern Tanzanian highlands, we demonstrate for the first time that increasing night time (Tmin) temperature is the most significant climatic variable responsible for diminishing C. arabica yields between 1961 and 2012. Projecting this forward, every 1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C rise in Tmin will result in annual yield losses of 137\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa016.87\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.80e-10).

Attention should also be drawn to the arabica growing regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya, as substantiated time series evidence shows these areas have followed strikingly similar minimum temperature trends. This is the first study on coffee, globally, providing essential time series evidence that climate change has already had a negative impact on C. arabica yields.'

We also present how these models represent the impact of climate change by the end of century (2061\xe2\x80\x932100) under the extreme scenario RCP8.5. First, we assess the models' ability to reproduce the observed timings of the monsoon onset and the rate of rapid fractional accumulation (RFA) slope \xe2\x80\x94 a measure of seasonality within the active monsoon period. Secondly, we apply a threshold-independent seasonality index (SI) \xe2\x80\x94 a multiplicative measure of precipitation (P) and extent of its concentration relative to uniform distribution (relative entropy \xe2\x80\x94 RE). We apply SI distinctly over the monsoonal precipitation regime (MPR), westerly precipitation regime (WPR) and annual precipitation. For the present climate, neither any single model nor the multi-model mean performs best in all chosen metrics. Models show overall a modest skill in suggesting right timings of the monsoon onset while the RFA slope is generally underestimated. One third of the models fail to capture the monsoon signal over the Indus basin. Mostly, the estimates for SI during WPR are higher than observed for all basins. When looking at MPR, the models typically simulate an SI higher (lower) than observed for the Ganges and Brahmaputra (Indus and Mekong) basins, following the pattern of overestimation (underestimation) of precipitation. Most of the models are biased negative (positive) for RE estimates over the Brahmaputra and Mekong (Indus and Ganges) basins, implying the extent of precipitation concentration for MPR and number of dry days within WPR lower (higher) than observed for these basins. Such skill of the CMIP5 models in representing the present-day monsoonal hydroclimatology poses some caveats on their ability to represent correctly the climate change signal. Nevertheless, considering the majority-model agreement as a measure of robustness for the qualitative scale projected future changes, we find a slightly delayed onset, and a general increase in the RFA slope and in the extent of precipitation concentration (RE) for MPR. Overall, a modest inter-model agreement suggests an increase in the seasonality of MPR and a less intermittent WPR for all basins and for most of the study domain. The SI-based indicator of change in the monsoonal domain suggests its extension westward over northwest India and Pakistan and northward over China. These findings have serious implications for the food and water security of the region in the future."

The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering. The frontline staffs of the national park need to be apprised about the ecology and impact of invasive plants for better monitoring and eradication of these detrimental plants.'

Author: 'Viola'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709001621
Abstract: 'AbstractThe status and trends of global biodiversity are often measured with a bias towards datasets limited to terrestrial vertebrates. The first global assessment of an insect order (Odonata) provides new context to the ongoing discussion of current biodiversity loss. A randomly selected sample of 1500 (26.4%) of the 5680 described dragonflies and damselflies was assessed using IUCN\xe2\x80\x99s Red List criteria. Distribution maps for each species were created and species were assigned to habitat types. These data were analysed in respect to threat level for regions and habitat types. We have found that one in 10 species of dragonflies and damselflies is threatened with extinction. This threat level is among the lowest of groups that have been assessed to date, suggesting that previous estimates of extinction risk for insects might be misleading. However, Odonata only comprise a small invertebrate order, with above-average dispersal ability and relatively wide distribution ranges. For conservation science and policy to be truly representative of global biodiversity a representative cross-section of invertebrates needs to be included.'

Title: 'The application of a proposed generic institutional framework for integrated coastal management to India'
Author: 'Manoj'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096456910100076X
Abstract: 'AbstractThe complex and dynamic nature of the coastal and marine area is prompting many nations to consider the internalisation of integrated coastal management (ICM) policy as part of a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. The institutional structures required to deliver such internalisation are subject to debate. This paper presents a suggested generic institutional framework derived through consideration of the core ICM process and proven organisational models. The proposed framework consists of an \xe2\x80\x98operating core\xe2\x80\x99 which facilitates local issue identification, evaluation and monitoring; an \xe2\x80\x98administrative component\xe2\x80\x99 of Central and State government to set policy direction, manage funding, and provide guidance on implementation and operation; a \xe2\x80\x98strategic apex\xe2\x80\x99 within Central government to oversee the transition from ICM concept to practice; and a \xe2\x80\x98co-ordinating mechanism\xe2\x80\x99 to allow open communication of ideas and information. The proposed framework is then applied to India, which currently faces the challenge of developing a suitable institutional framework to deliver ICM aspirations. It is concluded that the generic institutional framework works well when applied to India, with existing organisations and agencies requiring relatively minor organisational changes to address coastal and marine issues more effectively.'

Title: 'Coupling of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with AERMOD for pollutant dispersion modeling. A case study for PM10 dispersion over Pune, India'
Author: 'Amit P.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231006010570
Abstract: 'AbstractThe prediction of spatial variation of the concentration of a pollutant governed by various sources and sinks is a complex problem. Gaussian air pollutant dispersion models such as AERMOD of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) can be used for this purpose. AERMOD requires steady and horizontally homogeneous hourly surface and upper air meteorological observations. However, observations with such frequency are not easily available for most locations in India. To overcome this limitation, the planetary boundary layer and surface layer parameters required by AERMOD were computed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model (version 2.1.1) developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). We have developed a preprocessor for offline coupling of WRF with AERMOD. Using this system, the dispersion of respirable particulate matter (RSPM/PM10) over Pune, India has been simulated. Data from the emissions inventory development and field-monitoring campaign (13\xe2\x80\x9317 April 2005) conducted under the Pune Air Quality Management Program of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), India and USEPA, have been used to drive and validate AERMOD. Comparison between the simulated and observed temperature and wind fields shows that WRF is capable of generating reliable meteorological inputs for AERMOD. The comparison of observed and simulated concentrations of PM10 shows that the model generally underestimates the concentrations over the city. However, data from this single case study would not be sufficient to conclude on suitability of regionally averaged meteorological parameters for driving Gaussian models like AERMOD and additional simulations with different WRF parameterizations along with an improved pollutant source data will be required for enhancing the reliability of the WRF\xe2\x80\x93AERMOD modeling system.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIndian economy is largely depending upon the agricultural productivity and thus influences the trade among the SAARC countries. High-resolution and good-quality regional weather forecasts are necessary for planners, resource managers, insurers and national agro-advisory services. In this study, high resolution updated land-surface state in terms of vegetation fraction (VF) from operational vegetation index products of Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3A) sensor (CCD) was utilized in numerical weather prediction (NWP) model (e.g. WRF) to investigate its impact on short-range weather forecast over the control run. Results showed that the updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD improved the low-level 24\xc2\xa0h temperature (\xe2\x88\xbc18%) and moisture (\xe2\x88\xbc10%) forecast in comparison to control run. The 24\xc2\xa0h rainfall forecast was also improved (more than 5%) over central and southern India with the use of updated vegetation fraction compared to control experiment. INSAT 3A VF based experiment also showed a net improvement of 27% in surface sensible heat fluxes from WRF in comparison to control experiment when both were compared with area-averaged measurements from Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS). This triggers the need of more and more use of realistic and updated land surface states through satellite remote sensing data as well as in situ micrometeorological measurements to improve the forecast quality, skill and consistency.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Vegetation fraction (VF) from geostationary satellite for weather forecast. \xe2\x96\xba Compared short-range high-resolution forecasts using VF from two different sources. \xe2\x96\xba Substantial improvement in forecast quality with updated VF from INSAT 3A CCD.'

Title: 'Future projection of Indian summer monsoon variability under climate change scenario: An assessment from CMIP5 climate models'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Substantial changes are projected in the daily-to-interannual variability of Indian summer monsoon under RCP8.5 scenario.\xe2\x80\xa2Heavy rainfall events might increase, while number of wet days might decrease in future.\xe2\x80\xa2Active/break spells will be more intense and regionally extended in future climate.\xe2\x80\xa2Severity and frequency of both the strong (SM) and weak (WM) monsoons might increase in future climate.\xe2\x80\xa2SM (WM) could be more wet (dry) in future due to the lengthening of active (break) spells.AbstractIn this study, the impact of enhanced anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on the possible future changes in different aspects of daily-to-interannual variability of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) is systematically assessed using 20 coupled models participated in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5. The historical (1951\xe2\x80\x931999) and future (2051\xe2\x80\x932099) simulations under the strongest Representative Concentration Pathway have been analyzed for this purpose. A few reliable models are selected based on their competence in simulating the basic features of present-climate ISM variability. The robust and consistent projections across the selected models suggest substantial changes in the ISM variability by the end of 21st century indicating strong sensitivity of ISM to global warming. On the seasonal scale, the all-India summer monsoon mean rainfall is likely to increase moderately in future, primarily governed by enhanced thermodynamic conditions due to atmospheric warming, but slightly offset by weakened large scale monsoon circulation. It is projected that the rainfall magnitude will increase over core monsoon zone in future climate, along with lengthening of the season due to late withdrawal. On interannual timescales, it is speculated that severity and frequency of both strong monsoon (SM) and weak monsoon (WM) might increase noticeably in future climate. Substantial changes in the daily variability of ISM are also projected, which are largely associated with the increase in heavy rainfall events and decrease in both low rain-rate and number of wet days during future monsoon. On the subseasonal scale, the model projections depict considerable amplification of higher frequency (below 30\xc2\xa0day mode) components; although the dominant northward propagating 30\xe2\x80\x9370\xc2\xa0day mode of monsoon intraseasonal oscillations may not change appreciably in a warmer climate. It is speculated that the enhanced high frequency mode of monsoon ISOs due to increased GHG induced warming may notably modulate the ISM rainfall in future climate. Both extreme wet and dry episodes are likely to intensify and regionally extend in future climate with enhanced propensity of short active and long break spells. The SM (WM) could also be more wet (dry) in future due to the increment in longer active (break) spells. However, future changes in the spatial pattern during active/break phase of SM and WM are geographically inconsistent among the models. The results point out the growing climate-related vulnerability over Indian subcontinent, and further suggest the requisite of profound adaptation measures and better policy making in future.'

Abstract: "AbstractThis paper reviews biological and economic issues related to biodiversity, including problems of estimating the number of species globally, rates and causes of extinction, and measures biodiversity. It also argues that, while the value of the earth's ecosystems and natural capital may be large, at the margin, undiscovered pharmaceutical values of biodiversity and existence values are small. The challenge of biodiversity research is to make a stronger case for sacrificing economic development benefits for increased protection of biodiversity."

Title: 'Assessing the mitigation potential of forestry activities in a changing climate: A case study for Karnataka'
Author: 'Kaysara'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389934109002032
Abstract: "AbstractThe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol allows Afforestation and Reforestation (A/R) projects as mitigation activities to offset the CO2 in the atmosphere whilst simultaneously seeking to ensure sustainable development for the host country. The Kyoto Protocol was ratified by the Government of India in August 2002 and one of India's objectives in acceding to the Protocol was to fulfil the prerequisites for implementation of projects under the CDM in accordance with national sustainable priorities. The objective of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of using large-scale forestry projects under the CDM in achieving its twin goals using Karnataka State as a case study. The Generalized Comprehensive Mitigation Assessment Process (GCOMAP) Model is used to observe the effect of varying carbon prices on the land available for A/R projects. The model is coupled with outputs from the Lund\xe2\x80\x93Potsdam\xe2\x80\x93Jena (LPJ) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model to incorporate the impacts of temperature rise due to climate change under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2, A1B and B1. With rising temperatures and CO2, vegetation productivity is increased under A2 and A1B scenarios and reduced under B1. Results indicate that higher carbon price paths produce higher gains in carbon credits and accelerate the rate at which available land hits maximum capacity thus acting as either an incentive or disincentive for landowners to commit their lands to forestry mitigation projects."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The major food security challenges in the world remain under-investigated.\xe2\x80\xa2Research has a major bias on food availability in relation to crop production.\xe2\x80\xa2The role played by genetic resource diversity for food security is overlooked.\xe2\x80\xa2The linkages between ecosystem services and food security are mainly assumed.\xe2\x80\xa2Co-production, trade-offs, gender and cultural services are overlooked in research.AbstractIt has been widely recognized that food security depends on the sustainable use and provisioning of ecosystem services. The goal of this paper is to present an overview of the scientific literature on ecosystem services and food security, with a major focus on case studies of farming communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, in order to answer the following research questions: (1) does ecosystem services research generate knowledge that helps to address the major imperatives of food security?, and (2) are the multiple linkages between ecosystem services and food security analyzed or assumed in research? The results of the study highlighted that food utilization, access and stability, which are the major food security challenges in the world, remained under-investigated. There is a major bias on food availability in relation to crop production, and most articles assumed that food security would improve by increasing crop productivity, but this hypothesis remained largely untested. Other research blind-spots were co-production, trade-offs and off-site effects of ecosystem services in relation to food security, gender and cultural services. The study concludes that ecosystem services research needs to improve efforts to generate knowledge that helps to address the main imperatives of food security.'

Author: 'S.S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123847034002276
Abstract: "AbstractAgriculture vulnerability in India is not just limited to production losses. It has widespread socioeconomic impacts as its vulnerability affects a large amount of population that is dependent for their livelihood. Small landholding sizes, limited availability of infrastructure and support services, increased dependency on rainfall, and poor market linkages have increased the socioeconomic vulnerabilities of agriculture sector in India. Climate change is expected to further increase the level of current vulnerabilities and pose new challenges for the agricultural economy. In India, where the majority of the population practices subsistence agriculture, assessing sensitivity to climate change is extremely important.The chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the key variants that influence agricultural vulnerability and assesses the possible impacts due to climate change. Application of local knowledge, technological innovation, along with improved access to infrastructure facilities, and services will play a key role to reduce the vulnerabilities and enhance adaptation capacity in India's agriculture. This chapter makes specific recommendations to this effect."

Commensurate with the present day aversion to the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides; there is an overt emphasis on use of organic inputs and microbial inoculants which play an important role in sustainable agriculture. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are an important group of microbial inoculants that have been studied extensively for their ability to promote plant growth and improve productivity. PGPR operate through either direct or indirect mechanisms or a combination of both, and there by minimize the environmental impact of chemical intensive farming practices. Direct mechanisms of plant growth promotion include the secretion of plant growth promoting metabolites like indole acetic acid (IAA), cytokinins, gibberellins, etc., and facilitating the uptake of essential nutrients (N, P, Fe, Zn, etc.) from the atmospheric air and soil. Indirect promotion of the plant growth occurs when PGPR lessen or prevent the deleterious effect of phytopathogenic organisms by the production of antibiotics, siderophores, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), etc. Well known PGPRs that have reached the stage of commercial success, include Azospirillium, Azotobacter, Bacillus Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Serratia. But there are several novel PGPR on which considerable information is available, but such organisms have not attained commercial scales of production unlike their better known predecessors. PGPRs like Azoarcus, Exiguobacterium, Methylobacterium, Paenibacillus and Pantoea etc., fall in this category. The information available on these novel PGPRs with regard to their biology and utility are discussed in this review.'

The engine performance, combustion and emission is examined by measuring BSFC, BTE, In-cylinder pressure, MGT, HRR, CO, HC, NOx and smoke opacity. The authentic results were observed by using B20 and smaller orifice NHD. It is observed that smaller orifice NHD improves the air-fuel mixing, atomization, and vaporization which leads to shorter combustion duration. The B20 fuel showed better results such as performance at lower side of partial loads, combustion and emissions than the baseline diesel. The combination of B20 with smaller orifice NHD has shown appreciable results in performance, combustion and emissions. But, the only drawback was NOx is found to be increased."

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper combines insights from the social structures of accumulation framework, and a carefully delineated understanding of agency, to provide a conceptual and empirical contribution to the field of labour geography. This framework allows for a nuanced understanding of the complexity of the labour process as evinced by in-depth research conducted on the coconut industry in Kerala, India. The Kerala coconut industry has experienced various market changes post-agricultural liberalisation in the mid-1990s. The Government of Kerala has indicated these changes, including increasing imports of palm oil and new trade agreements, have led to a crisis; an issue of considerable importance to the state economy and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 livelihoods. More recent government explanations for the crisis include a labour shortage; particularly an inadequate supply of coconut harvesters. This simplistic explanation (based on neoclassical economic models) masks the complexity of locally constituted labour dynamics in an \xe2\x80\x98unorganised\xe2\x80\x99 labour market. A more nuanced understanding reveals that labour market organisation varies by place and difficulties are more adequately explained through changing agrarian relations and the inability to sufficiently control labour. These findings lead to three primary arguments: (1) labour markets are socially and spatially structured and their regulation varies with geographical, historical and political\xe2\x80\x93economic processes in particular places; (2) unorganised labour is able to regulate itself socially and informally, albeit in small ways; and (3) a structural approach is valuable to understand labour agency and the ways informal, unorganised labour is regulated.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Labour markets are socially and spatially structured. \xe2\x96\xba Unorganised labour regulates itself socially and informally. \xe2\x96\xba A combined structure\xe2\x80\x93agency approach is valuable to understand labour dynamics. \xe2\x96\xba Neoclassical economic understanding of labour market change is inadequate for policy. \xe2\x96\xba Coconut crisis in Kerala is linked to changing structures of labour control.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn this study an analysis was made on spatial variation of climatic water balance, (water surplus, actual evapotranspiration), probabilistic monthly monsoon rainfall and mapping of cold periods in agro-ecological region (AER) 12.0 of India using GIS and models. Since, rice is the dominant crop of the region, crop water requirements of rice was also spatially analyzed in different agro-ecological subregions (AESRs) of the AER 12.0 using CROPWAT 4.0 model and GIS. Study found that as per climatic water balance, large to moderate water surplus (520\xe2\x80\x9370\xc2\xa0mm) was available in AESR 12.1. The rainfall surplus of 220\xe2\x80\x93370\xc2\xa0mm was computed in AESR 12.2 and 370\xe2\x80\x93520\xc2\xa0mm in AESR 12.3\xc2\xa0mm. Since winter rainfall is meagre and erratic, this amount of rainfall may be harvested and utilized for providing supplemental irrigation to winter crops or during dry spell of rainy season crops. Study also reveals that at 80% probability level (highly assured) in first month of southwest monsoon (June) 98\xe2\x80\x93156\xc2\xa0mm rainfall occurs in AESR 12.1, 103\xe2\x80\x93144\xc2\xa0mm in AESR 12.2 and 93\xe2\x80\x93132\xc2\xa0mm in AESR 12.3.

Title: 'Validation of Geospatial model for Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level\xe2\x80\x94a study in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, India'

Abstract: "AbstractThe present paper deals with Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level, preparing thematic maps for spatial representation of landscape parameters and then validation of the geospatial model using a three-tier approach, viz., landscape analysis, field data extrapolation and geospatial analysis, for two groups of islands in Indian subcontinent. On-screen visual interpretation approach based on IRS LISS-III and Landsat TM data sets was used to delineate the vegetation communities. Field survey attributes on species diversity, economical/medicinal uses and endemism were suitably linked with satellite image-derived landscape attributes in a geospatial domain. The landscape parameters, viz., fragmentation and disturbance index, clearly indicate that Nicobar Islands are less disturbed compared to Andaman. The phytosociological data of different vegetation types collected from 544 stratified sample points was recorded with ground coordinates. The plant communities of Andaman show high plant diversity in terms of number of species (523 species) and more heterogeneity compared to those of Nicobar (347 species). Biological richness was estimated as a function of six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) to stratify forest vegetation in two phytogeographically distinct groups of tropical islands, viz., Andaman and Nicobar, using a customized software, SPLAM.Validation of ecological indices had always been a major challenge for ecologist. Here, we discuss a validation technique using field-driven species regression equations for fragmentation (FR), disturbance (DI) and biological richness (BR) indices and propose improvements in the biological richness methodology. The research question of establishment of linkages between expressions of diversity at different scales is sought and thereby validating the existing model outputs has been proposed. The sensitivity of in-field measurements with landscape parameters has been explicitly analyzed. During validation, the species richness, diversity and mean basal area have shown slow decrease with sudden rise in intermediate levels followed by a steep decline at increasing levels of fragmentation and disturbance. The empirically derived regression coefficient has significant correspondence (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in terms of community response in both island's groups. The vegetation communities in the forested landscape possess significant linkages with landscape scale processes, viz., FR and DI, as evident by the degree of correlation. The heterogeneity measured as diversity in habit group shows community dimensions in different spatial zones. The generation of baseline data on community ecology allows prioritization of planning process and evolves specific management practices. It may be concluded that the improved biodiversity assessment model and the designed validation techniques have enhanced the reliability of model thus widened the scope for its application in the rapid biodiversity assessment."

Abstract: 'AbstractSystematic notions of significant human impacts on regional and global climate change and species extinctions developed first in the French and British colonial empires. Building on classical Greek theories linking deforestation to rainfall decline the colonial climatic theorists were stimulated by the Newtonian thinking of Stepben Hales and his disciples. The new climate theories led to pioneering forest protection schemes in Tobago, St Vincent, St Helena, Mauritius and western India where the East India Company actively promoted conservation. The Royal Society of Arts, the Academie des Sciences and the Royal Geographical Society all acted as institutional mechanisms for encouraging forest protection based on fears of climate change, long before early environmentalism developed in the United States.'

Around the globe, petroleum based reserves are going to deplete which could result in price hike and create concern about environmental pollution. The researchers are focusing on developing and using an eco-friendly lubricant derived from renewable resources. Non-edible vegetable oil based bio-lubricants are eco-friendly lubricants due to their biodegradability, non-toxicity and zero greenhouse gas emission. This study presents the potential use of non-edible vegetable oil for the production of bio-lubricants. In this study, resources, properties, benefits, and application of non-edible vegetable oil based bio-lubricants as alternatives were discussed. It also includes the description of the global lubricant market and future scope. Non-edible vegetable oil based bio-lubricants have enhanced lubricity, high viscosity, good anti-wear property, high viscosity index, increases equipment service life, high load carrying ability, low evaporation rate, low emission of metal traces into the atmosphere.'

Percentage forest protection (IUCN I\xe2\x80\x93IV) varied greatly between realms from 5.5% (Palearctic) to 13.4% (Australasia), and for forest types from 3.2% (temperate freshwater swamp forest) to 28% (temperate broadleaf evergreen forest). Median protection of forest cover in 670 ecoregions (forest above a specified threshold) was 5.9% (IUCN I\xe2\x80\x93IV); at IUCN I\xe2\x80\x93VI, 46% of the ecoregions had less than 10% forest protection. Considering their biodiversity importance, forest protection within global priority areas was insufficient, e.g., median protection of 8.4% in biodiversity hotspots (IUCN I\xe2\x80\x93IV). Results have policy relevance in terms of the target of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), reconfirmed in 2008, to effectively conserve \xe2\x80\x9cat least 10% of each of the world\xe2\x80\x99s forest types\xe2\x80\x9d.

Abstract: "AbstractEmpirical research provides contradictory evidence of the loss of traditional ecological knowledge across societies. Researchers have argued that culture, methodological differences, and site-specific conditions are responsible for such contradictory evidences. We advance and test a third explanation: the adaptive nature of traditional ecological knowledge systems. Specifically, we test whether different domains of traditional ecological knowledge experience different secular changes and analyze trends in the context of other changes in livelihoods. We use data collected among 651 Tsimane' men (Bolivian Amazon). Our findings indicate that different domains of knowledge follow different secular trends. Among the domains of knowledge analyzed, medicinal knowledge and wild edible knowledge appear as the most vulnerable; canoe building knowledge and firewood knowledge seem to remain constant across generations; whereas house building knowledge seems to experience a slight secular increase. Our analysis reflects on the adaptive nature of traditional ecological knowledge, highlighting how changes in this knowledge system respond to the particular needs of a society in a given point of time.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Different domains of traditional plant knowledge follow different secular changes. \xe2\x96\xba The most vulnerable knowledge for Tsimane' men relates to medicinal and wild edibles. \xe2\x96\xba Knowledge of firewood and canoe building seems stable among Tsimane' men. \xe2\x96\xba Knowledge related to house building experience a secular increase. \xe2\x96\xba Secular changes in traditional plant knowledge are associated to changes in livelihood."

Abstract: 'ABSTRACTChange, usually, comes slowly. It results from the desire of the population and the needs and acceptance of society for a gradual alteration which will only permit acceleration in urgent situations. Traditions are deeply rooted and have evolved in response to religious and social customs, available resources, communication - or lack of it, climate, and an economic base. Institutions, created to advance and promote the needs of people, many assist or hinder in the implementation of policies that result in change. This paper discusses some of these issues in the light of world-wide experiences.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2This is the first nationwide systematic effort to characterize carbon in forest biomass at 5\xc2\xa0km grid level in India.\xe2\x80\xa2This study is attempted to establish a long-term geospatial dataset on carbon stocks for Indian forests.\xe2\x80\xa2Estimated spatial distribution of carbon density from remote sensing, historical archives and collateral data (1930-2013).\xe2\x80\xa2This study found that forests of India have experienced a 50.08% loss of carbon stocks over eight decades.\xe2\x80\xa2Spatial data on forest carbon stocks of India will provide important insights for conservation.AbstractThe present study has estimated spatial distribution of biomass carbon density from satellite remote sensing data, historical archives and collateral data from 1930 to 2013. The spatial forest canopy density datasets for 1930, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 were analysed to obtain biomass carbon pools at 5\xc2\xa0km grid level. The overall loss of forest cover was 28% from 1930 to 2013. Analysis of change in the forest canopy density indicates that the dense forest cover reduced from 419,175\xc2\xa0km2 in 1975 to 390,966\xc2\xa0km2 in 2013. The total above ground biomass carbon stock of Indian forest was calculated as 3070.27\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C in 2013. Standing biomass carbon stocks varied significantly during different steps of time periods. There are a total 67,184 grid cells with loss of carbon stocks during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975 followed by 55,742 cells during 1975\xe2\x80\x931985. The annual carbon loss in the above ground biomass showed the highest decrease during the period of 1930 to 1975 and estimated as 2168.50\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C while the net annual loss of carbon is 48.19\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C. The maximum observed net annual loss of carbon stocks was 53.97\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C during 2005 to 2013. Carbon content for various states shows that maximum carbon stocks were stored in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh (11.27%) in 2013. State-wise change analysis indicates the highest loss of carbon stocks in Tripura (80.99%) from 1930 to 2013. Overall reduction in carbon stock in Indian forests has been estimated as 3079.98\xc2\xa0Tg\xc2\xa0C (50.08%) from 1930 to 2013. The spatial characterization of distribution and changes in carbon stocks can provide useful information for planning and strategic management of resources and fulfilling global initiatives to conserve forest biodiversity.'

Title: 'Occurrence and distribution of Indian primates'
Author: 'Krithi K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000509
Abstract: 'AbstractGlobal and regional species conservation efforts are hindered by poor distribution data and range maps. Many Indian primates face extinction, but assessments of population status are hindered by lack of reliable distribution data. We estimated the current occurrence and distribution of 15 Indian primates by applying occupancy models to field data from a country-wide survey of local experts. We modeled species occurrence in relation to ecological and social covariates (protected areas, landscape characteristics, and human influences), which we believe are critical to determining species occurrence in India. We found evidence that protected areas positively influence occurrence of seven species and for some species are their only refuge. We found evergreen forests to be more critical for some primates along with temperate and deciduous forests. Elevation negatively influenced occurrence of three species. Lower human population density was positively associated with occurrence of five species, and higher cultural tolerance was positively associated with occurrence of three species. We find that 11 primates occupy less than 15% of the total land area of India. Vulnerable primates with restricted ranges are Golden langur, Arunachal macaque, Pig-tailed macaque, stump-tailed macaque, Phayre\xe2\x80\x99s leaf monkey, Nilgiri langur and Lion-tailed macaque. Only Hanuman langur and rhesus macaque are widely distributed. We find occupancy modeling to be useful in determining species ranges, and in agreement with current species ranking and IUCN status. In landscapes where monitoring efforts require optimizing cost, effort and time, we used ecological and social covariates to reliably estimate species occurrence and focus species conservation efforts.'

Title: 'Chapter 20 - Integrated Management of Rodent Pests'
Author: 'R.S.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123985293000221
Abstract: 'Rodents cause immense losses to agricultural production globally. Of the 2277 living rodent species in the world, 103 species occur in India. However, only a little over a dozen species are regarded as pests in field and commensal situations. Losses caused by rodents vary from crop to crop, season to season and in different agro-climatic regions. Some of them are also vectors of several zoonotic diseases. This chapter discusses the rodent pest species, their distribution, losses caused in agriculture and other sectors and the control techniques with reference to India. Presently, rodent management technology is mainly dependent on the use of toxic chemicals. Zinc phosphide is the most common rodenticide used in most developing countries including India, however, in recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on second generation anticoagulant rodenticides. Information exists on the bio-efficacy of several other second generation anticoagulants against Indian rodents, but only one compound (bromadiolone) is registered in India. Integration of acute and anticoagulant rodenticides along with habitat manipulation and mechanical methods are the major components of integrated management of pest rodents in India. Rodenticides do provide quicker control of rodents but are not effective on a long-term basis. Extensive research on the ecology and behaviour of pest rodents and new approaches to management techniques, for example biological control (biocides and antifertility techniques) and repellents, need to be strengthened to evolve the IPM package for rodent pests. Additionally, various extension media also need to be fully exploited to create awareness among farmers about the rodent problem and their sustainable management for enhanced food and health security.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Land use change is the most visible and complex form of change triggered by several determinants.\xe2\x80\xa2As multiple drivers shape land use change, transdisciplinary research is requisite for management.\xe2\x80\xa2Geospatial data, tools and techniques offers potential to connect disciplinary knowledge.\xe2\x80\xa2Role of effective \xe2\x80\x98entry points\xe2\x80\x99 is key to develop and scale transdisciplinary understanding.\xe2\x80\xa2LCLUC is explained as a good entry point.AbstractThis article highlights applied understanding of classifying earth imaging data for land cover land use change (LCLUC) information. Compared to the many previous studies of LCLUC, the present study is innovative in that it applied geospatial data, tools and techniques for transdisciplinary research. It contributes to a wider discourse on practical decision making for multi-level governance. Undertaken as part of the BioDIVA project, the research adopted a multi-tiered methodical approach across three key dimensions: socioecology as the sphere of interest, a transdisciplinary approach as the disciplinary framework, and geospatial analysis as the applied methodology. The area of interest was the agroecosystem of Wayanad district in Kerala, India (South Asia). The methodology was structured to enable analysis of multi-scalar and multi-temporal data, using Wayanad as a case study. Three levels of analysis included: District (Landsat TM-30m), Taluk or sub-district (ASTER-15m) and Village or Gram Panchayat (GeoEye-0.5m). Our hypothesis, that analyzing patterns of land use change is pertinent for up-to-date assessment of agroecosystem resources and their wise management is supported by the outcome of the multi-tiered geospatial analysis. In addition, two examples from the project that highlight the adoption of LCLUC by different disciplinary experts are presented. A sociologist assessed the land ownership boundary for a selected tribal community. A faunal ecologist used it to assess the effect of landscape structure on arthropods and plant groups in rice fields. Furthermore, the Google Earth interface was used to support the overall validation process. Our key conclusion was that a multi-level understanding of the causes, effects, processes and mechanisms that govern agroecosystem transformation requires close attention to spatial, temporal and seasonal dynamics, for which the incorporation of local knowledge and participation of local communities is crucial.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWorld\xe2\x80\x99s human population is increasing rapidly day by day and has been reached to 7.324 billion by 2015. This rapid increase in the population is expanding energy demands and led to an energy crisis throughout the world, leading to the search for alternative sources of energy. Biofuels are an attractive solution for offsetting fossil fuels for a number of different reasons. There are various potential feed stocks for biodiesel production. From an economic and social perspective edible seed oil should be substituted by non-edible, lower cost and reliable seed oil for biodiesel production. We reviewed in this paper previously declared potential plant sources of biodiesel reported in Pakistan. Various related aspects of these feed stocks has been reviewed from numerous current publications, including oil extraction techniques, fatty acid composition profile (FAC) of non-edible seed oils, biodiesel standards and characterizations. We concluded from our review that the easy availability of non-edible plant resources in various parts of the world pave ways for its use in biodiesel production. It can supplant the dependency on edible plant seed oil resources and to tackle with the devastating crises of energy in Pakistan and worldwide.'

Title: 'Can local use assist in controlling invasive alien species in tropical forests? The case of Lantana camara in southern India'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We considered the use of the invasive Lantana camara as an opportunity for control.\xe2\x80\xa2Forest inventory showed reduced density of Lantana plants in harvested sites.\xe2\x80\xa2Season of cutting and stem cut influenced the extent of regrowth and mortality.\xe2\x80\xa2Harvesting may check Lantana at the local scale, but not at a landscape scale.AbstractMany invasive alien species (IAS) are used by local communities for a variety of subsistence and income generating purposes. This frequently poses a conflict of interest for their removal due to forest conservation and biodiversity concerns. However, if local use can simultaneously check or control specific IAS, the conflict can be avoided and both development and forest conservation perspectives accommodated in the short to medium term. We examine this for Lantana camara invasion in southern India through assessment of the demand for and impacts of harvesting on this globally problematic IAS. We interviewed local artisans regarding their knowledge and quantities of Lantana used, along with forest surveys to estimate Lantana densities and size classes in harvested and unharvested sites, and lastly we undertook controlled cutting in moist and dry deciduous forests in both the wet and dry seasons to examine rate of regrowth and mortality. Over the entire study area the abundance of Lantana far outweighed local demand, but at small scales around villages, density and size classes were significantly reduced through harvesting. The controlled cutting experiment showed marked seasonal differences, with the most severe cutting intensity resulting in significant mortality when Lantana plants were cut in the wet season, but with limited effect when cut in the dry season. We conclude that promoting local use of IAS may be a feasible approach in controlling them and thereby limiting their impacts in forests.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLandscape ecology has brought spatial analysis and geospatial modeling to the forefront of ecological research. In this study, we investigated changes in landscape structure and the ecological consequences of urbanization in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area using spatial indices, change analysis, and geospatial modeling. Major land transformation patterns from 1975 to 2006 were mapped using multi-temporal classification maps. Landscape metrics for 1975, 1986, 1998, and 2006 were calculated and analyzed using Patch Analyst. The deforestation process due to urbanization in the future was modeled using GEOMOD within the framework of 2030 regional land use planning. Results reveal urban area expanded 82% from 1975 to 2006, mainly by displacing forest and agricultural lands by in-filling gaps within the urban area or near its periphery. Leap-frog development was noticeably absent. Many small patches of forest and agriculture located within or near the urban and suburban areas were replaced directly by urban land uses. Urbanization has become ecologically complicated but geometrically simpler whereas the rural landscape became less abundant and diverse. We predict: (1) forest cover will continue to decrease consistently due to on-going urbanization process; and (2) the pattern of deforestation will occur within the urban area due to in-filling and along its periphery as the urban area expands outward into undeveloped areas.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Landscape structure and dynamics were evaluated using landscape indices and GEOMOD. \xe2\x96\xba Large amount of agriculture and forest land were converted to urban land uses since 1975. \xe2\x96\xba Urban in-filling pattern rather than leap-frog development was revealed. \xe2\x96\xba Urban expansion resulted in a geometrically simpler but more complicated urban landscape. \xe2\x96\xba Rural landscape is becoming less abundant with a decrease in the extended ecotones.'

Abstract: 'AbstractBiodiversity is the feedstock for the biotechnology industry. Hence, the conservation, enhancement and sustainable and equitable use of biodiversity should be accorded high priority in all national environment protection programmes. Lichens serve as useful indicators of environmental health. Similarly, several blue green algae help to sequester salt from water. There is need for the more widespread use of such biomonitoring and bioremediation agents. Bioprospecting research designed to identify novel metabolites must be rooted in the principle of equity in sharing benefits with the holders of traditional knowledge. There is need for greater vigil against alien invasive species, since with growing world trade in food grains and other agricultural commodities, there is an increasing possibility of introducing new pests, weeds and harmful micro-organisms. Finally, biological scientists should place emphasis on their ethical responsibility for the consequences of their research, since otherwise bioterrorism could become a major threat to human security.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWe contribute to the debate on the social implications of carbon forestry projects by showing that tradeoffs exist between social benefits of projects and their cost-effectiveness. Large-scale industrial plantations and strict forest protection are economically viable, but pose the highest social risks. Socially beneficial projects are less cost-effective because of their higher transaction costs. Enabling policies are also required for their success. Regulation of carbon markets will therefore be required to reduce social risks and enhance benefits. We propose a number of regulatory and proactive measures and justify them on the basis of market imperfections and concepts of sustainable development.'

Climate projections from an ensemble of 5 GCMs (MPI-ECHAM5, BCCR-BCM2.0, CSIRO-mk3.5, IPSL-CM4, and MRI-CGCM2) are used in this study. Hydrologic simulations for the current as well as future climate scenarios are carried out using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) integrated with ArcGIS (ArcSWAT v.2009). The results show marginal reduction in runoff ratio, annual streamflow and groundwater recharge towards the end of the century. Increased temperature and evapotranspiration project an increase in the irrigation demand towards the end of the century. Rainfall projections for the future shows marginal increase in the annual average rainfall. Short and moderate wet spells are projected to decrease, whereas short and moderate dry spells are projected to increase in the future. Projected reduction in streamflow and groundwater recharge along with the increase in irrigation demand is likely to aggravate the water stress in the region under the future scenario.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe present climatic deterioration including the much debated anthropogenic acceleration to the global warming phenomenon has drawn the attention of scientific community, policy makers as well as the general public to the problem of climate change. Chemostratigraphic techniques have proven to be very useful to understand the past climate of the earth that has been changing naturally on timescales ranging from decades to millions of years. Therefore, it is important to filter out the natural signal to correctly gauge the effects induced by humans. This is where the science of paleoclimatology becomes very important. It helps us to understand the pattern of evolution of the earth's climate system, its rhythm, and pulse using various natural archives such as marine and lacustrine sediments, speleothems, ice cores, corals, trees, etc., that hold the clue to the past climate variability. Several proxies are studied from such natural archives to reconstruct the past climatic changes. Out of these, the stable isotopes are one of the most useful and widely employed. In this present study, we explain the methodology behind the application of the stable isotopes as a proxy to reconstruct past climatic changes. We present here a few examples of the stable isotopes of the most widely used elements viz oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen from the marine realm and their systematics. The use of chemostratigraphic techniques like application of oxygen isotopes in stratigraphy, temperature, salinity, and ice-volume reconstruction; Cenozoic oxygen and carbon isotope curves; the limitations in the form of vital effect and diagenesis in the case of foraminifera; use of nitrogen and carbon isotopes as productivity and provenance indicator, respectively, are presented in this paper."

Anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change increases geomorphic hazards and risks but also provides new opportunities for mountain landscape enhancement. Each theme is considered with respect to the distinctiveness of mountain geomorphology and in relation to important advances in research over the past decade. The traditional reliance on the high energy condition to define mountain geomorphology seems less important than the presence of unique mountain landforms and landscapes and the distinctive ways in which human activity and anthropogenically induced hydroclimate change are transforming mountain landscapes.'

Title: 'Low flow and high flow responses to converting natural grassland into bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) in Nilgiris watersheds of South India'
Author: 'A.K'

Abstract: 'AbstractA concern has been raised in many parts of the world over the effect of large scale planting of Eucalyptus on hydrological behaviour of small watersheds. Hydrological response of watersheds due to conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations on low flows and high flows has been presented in this paper. The concept of using low flow index (LFI) as a tool to study and quantify the effects of bluegum plantation on low flow regime has been demonstrated. Conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum plantations has resulted in decreased low flow volume as well as peak flow, which in turn increased the soil moisture losses. These effects were more pronounced during the second rotation (i.e. first coppiced growth) as compared to the first rotation. Significant reduction in low flow as a result of decline in base flow could be predicted with LFI decreasing by 2.0 and 3.75 times, in the first and second rotation, respectively. Moderation in peak discharge rates was also observed as a result of bluegum plantation. Probability plots of peak discharge tend to suggest that the effect of bluegum plantation on peak flows become insignificant for the floods with higher return periods. These results clearly suggest that caution need to be exercised while planning large scale conversion of natural grasslands into bluegum plantations in the catchments of hydro-electric reservoirs in the Nilgiris which adversely affects water availability especially during lean flow period.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe energy demand across the globe has increased in many folds due to technological advancement, rapid growth in industries and increase in household energy demand. This led the engineers and planners to think and find the means to harvest the alternative energy sources other than the fossil fuel. Solar, wind, biomass, mini hydro are some of the resources used worldwide to generate energy as per the availability of resources. This paper presents a comparative performances of various stand alone solar photovoltaic(PV), grid connected PV and hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) studied across the globe. The standalone PV system is used to supply electricity to a small habitats/hamlets or to a single household. Hybrid energy system consists of two or more energy sources for generation of power for rural electrification in off grid locations and in grid connected PV systems, excess electricity produced is injected to the grid thereby generating additional income. The research works carried out by various researchers around the globe on renewable energy sources particularly for rural electrification is discussed in this paper. Besides this the utilisation of renewable electricity for Plug-in-Electric Vehicles (PEV) studied across the globe were also discussed.'

Its knowledge is important to a range of issues and themes in earth sciences central to urban climatology and human\xe2\x80\x93environment interactions. The present study investigates the effect of urbanization on the land surface temperature (LST) based DTR. This study presents spatial and temporal variations of satellite based estimates of annually averaged DTR over megacity Delhi, the capital of India, which are shown for a period of 11\xc2\xa0years during 2001\xe2\x80\x932011 and analyzes this with regard to its land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes and population growth. Delhi which witnessed massive urbanization in terms of population growth (decadal growth rate of Delhi during 2001\xe2\x80\x932011 was 20.96%) and major transformations in the LU/LC (built-up area crossed more than 53%) are experiencing severity in its micro and macroclimate. There was a consistent increase in the areas experiencing DTR below 11\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C which typically resembled the \xe2\x80\x98urban class\xe2\x80\x99 viz. from 26.4% in the year 2001 to 65.3% in the year 2011 and subsequently the DTR of entire Delhi which was 12.48\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C in the year 2001 gradually reduced to 10.34\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C in the year 2011, exhibiting a significant decreasing trend. Rapidly urbanizing areas like Rohini, Dwarka, Vasant Kunj, Kaushambi, Khanjhawala Village, IIT, Safdarjung Airport, etc. registered a significant decreasing trend in the DTR. In the background of the converging DTR, which was primarily due to the increase in the minimum temperatures, a grim situation in terms of potentially net increase in the heat-related mortality rate especially for the young children below 15\xc2\xa0years of age is envisaged for Delhi. Considering the earlier findings that the level of risk of death remained the highest and longest for Delhi, in comparison to megacities like Sao Paulo and London, the study calls for strong and urgent heat island mitigation measures.'

Title: 'Characterising rice-based farming systems to identify opportunities for adopting water efficient cultivation methods in Tamil Nadu, India'
Author: 'K.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377409002406
Abstract: 'AbstractEfficient water use in rice cultivation is a prerequisite for sustaining food security for the rice consuming population of India. Novel rice production practices, including water-saving techniques, modifications in transplanting, spacing, weeding and nutrient management, have been developed and shown to be effective on farm, but adoption of these techniques by farmers has remained restricted. Potential constraints include technical difficulties with new practices, and labour and gender issues which differ between farms. On the basis of a rapid survey of 100 rice-based farms, four farm types were identified based on their socio-economic and biophysical characteristics. Detailed farm surveys were conducted on three representative farms of each farm type to evaluate land use patterns, use of inputs such as water, labour, nutrient, capital and machinery, income from crop and animal production and off-farm activities. Opportunities exist for one or more new rice cultivation techniques to be adopted in all the four farm types. For all farm types, however, the opportunities for use of water-saving irrigation were the least promising. In general, adoption of water-saving irrigation will not improve farmers\xe2\x80\x99 livelihoods despite its importance in reducing water scarcity problems at regional scale. At farm scale, the potential for adoption of water-saving irrigation depends on the season, location of fields and the irrigation source. Changes in government policies such as rules and regulations, pricing, institution building and infrastructure development, as well as training and education of farmers are needed to improve the adoption of modified methods for rice cultivation.'

Abstract: 'SummaryDue to data limitations, current multidimensional measures of poverty use household rather than the individual as the unit of analysis. Household measures are unable to capture intrahousehold differences in resource allocation which differ along gender lines. This paper uses data from the Karnataka Household Asset Survey to construct an individual level multidimensional poverty measure for Karnataka, India. Our results show that individual level measures can identify substantial gender differences in poverty that are masked when using household measures. Thus, gender-disaggregated data and analysis can provide a useful complement to household level poverty measures.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnderstanding carbon stocks relative to tree species is important for managing tropical forests in a way that will result in the carbon emission reductions and biodiversity conservation required under the REDD+\xc2\xa0scheme. Here we analyse inventory data from 179 sample plots in semi-evergreen forests of three provinces in Cambodia. Across all study sites, 5,995 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm, comprising 79 species from 38 families, were analysed. Tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae were most common (10 species), followed by the species of Caesalpinaceae, Combretaceae and Ebenaceae. Analysis of relative carbon stocks (RCS) suggested that Lagerstroemia calyculata Kurz (RCS=14.3%), Syzygium sp. (6.8%), Shorea vulgaris (5.0%), Irvingia malayana (4.8%), Anisoptera costata Kort (4.6%), Vatica astrotricha (4.2%), and Dehaasia cuneata Blume (3.8%) together accounted for 43.6% of the total average carbon stocks of 99.8\xc2\xb14.8\xc2\xa0MgC\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. We found that carbon stock is highly correlated to basal area (R2=0.993) but not to stem density (R2=0.153). Using carbon stock values, we estimated the carbon emission due to deforestation of semi-evergreen forests to be 8.3\xc2\xa0TgCO2 \xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in Cambodia between 2002 and 2010.

Abstract: 'AbstractMalaria is a major public health problem in India and one which contributes significantly to the overall malaria burden in Southeast Asia. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program of India reported \xe2\x88\xbc1.6 million cases and \xe2\x88\xbc1100 malaria deaths in 2009. Some experts argue that this is a serious underestimation and that the actual number of malaria cases per year is likely between 9 and 50 times greater, with an approximate 13-fold underestimation of malaria-related mortality. The difficulty in making these estimations is further exacerbated by (i) highly variable malaria eco-epidemiological profiles, (ii) the transmission and overlap of multiple Plasmodium species and Anopheles vectors, (iii) increasing antimalarial drug resistance and insecticide resistance, and (iv) the impact of climate change on each of these variables. Simply stated, the burden of malaria in India is complex. Here we describe plans for a Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India (CSCMi), one of ten International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research (ICEMRs) located in malarious regions of the world recently funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health. The CSCMi is a close partnership between Indian and United States scientists, and aims to address major gaps in our understanding of the complexity of malaria in India, including changing patterns of epidemiology, vector biology and control, drug resistance, and parasite genomics. We hope that such a multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical and field studies with laboratory, molecular, and genomic methods will provide a powerful combination for malaria control and prevention in India.Graphical abstractWe present plans for a Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India (CSCMi), a partnership between Indian and United States scientists, made possible through funding from the National Institutes of Health and their commitment to establish International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research.

Abstract: 'AbstractAn energy resource that is renewed by nature and whose supply is not affected by the rate of consumption is often termed as renewable energy. The need to search for renewable, alternate and non-polluting sources of energy assumes top priority for self-reliance in the regional energy supply. This demands an estimation of available energy resources spatially to evolve better management strategies for ensuring sustainability of resources. The spatial mapping of availability and demand of energy resources would help in the integrated regional energy planning through an appropriate energy supply\xe2\x80\x93demand matching. This paper discusses the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) to map the renewable energy potential talukwise in Karnataka State, India. Taluk is an administrative division in the federal set-up in India to implement developmental programmes like dissemination of biogas, improved stoves, etc. Hence, this paper focuses talukwise mapping of renewable energy (solar, wind, bioenergy and small hydroenergy) potential for Karnataka using GIS. GIS helps in spatial and temporal analyses of the resources and demand and also aids as Decision Support System while implementing location-specific renewable energy technologies.Regions suitable for tapping solar energy are mapped based on global solar radiation data, which provides a picture of the potential. Coastal taluks in Uttara Kannada have higher global solar radiation during summer (6.31\xc2\xa0kWh/m2), monsoon (4.16\xc2\xa0kWh/m2) and winter (5.48\xc2\xa0kWh/m2). Mapping of regions suitable for tapping wind energy has been done based on wind velocity data, and it shows that Chikkodi taluk, Belgaum district, has higher potential during summer (6.06\xc2\xa0m/s), monsoon (8.27\xc2\xa0m/s) and winter (5.19\xc2\xa0m/s). Mysore district has the maximum number of small hydropower plants with a capacity of 36\xc2\xa0MW. Talukwise computation of bioenergy availability from agricultural residue, forest, horticulture, plantation and livestock indicates that Channagiri taluk in Shimoga district yields maximum bioenergy. The bioenergy status analysis shows that Siddapur taluk in Uttara Kannada district has the highest bioenergy status of 2.004 (ratio of bioresource availability and demand).'

Title: 'Conservation-induced resettlement as a driver of land cover change in India: An object-based trend analysis'
Author: 'Rutherford V.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2OBIA and trend analysis were used to study resettlement from Rajaji National Park, India.\xe2\x80\xa2People were relocated from riparian/mixed forest areas to grass/brush areas.\xe2\x80\xa2Changes in NDVI were associated with new agricultural land and increased disturbances.\xe2\x80\xa2Resettlement has shifted pressure to less ecologically valuable land cover types outside the park.AbstractLocated in the foothills of the Indian Himalaya, Rajaji National Park was established to protect and enhance the habitat of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). In 2002 the Van Gujjars, indigenous forest pastoralists, were voluntarily resettled from the Chilla Range (an administrative unit of Rajaji National Park) to Gaindikhata, a nearby area where they were granted land for agriculture. In this study we used a variety of remote sensing approaches to identify changes in land cover associated with the resettlement. The methods comprise two main approaches. First, we used object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify the pre-resettlement land cover classes of use areas (representing agricultural expansion and adjacent areas of grazing, and collection of fuelwood and fodder) and recovery areas (representing areas where settlements were removed, and the adjacent areas of resource use). Secondly, we used trend analysis to assess the gradual and abrupt changes in vegetation that took place in use and recovery areas. To conduct the trend analysis we used BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), which separates seasonal variation from long-term trends, and identifies breaks that can be linked back to disturbances or land cover changes. We found that the OBIA classification yielded high average class accuracies, and we were able to make class distinctions that would have been difficult to make using a traditional pixel-based approach. Pre-resettlement, the recovery areas were classified as mixed forest and riparian vegetation. In contrast, the use areas were classified primarily as grass dominated, brush dominated, and plantation forest, and were located relatively far away from riparian areas. Following the resettlement, the trend analysis showed a sudden change in the seasonal variation of NDVI in areas converted to agriculture. Areas neighboring the new agricultural land experienced sudden decreases in NDVI, suggestive of disturbances, at a higher rate than the same land cover types elsewhere. At the same time, these neighboring areas experienced a gradual overall increase in NDVI which could be caused by an expansion of leafy invasive shrubs such as Lantana camara in areas heavily used for biomass collection. The recovery areas also experienced a gradual increase in NDVI as well as sudden breaks to this trend, but we lacked evidence to connect these changes to the resettlement. Our findings support the claim that the resettlement has shifted pressure from more ecologically valuable to less ecologically valuable land cover types, and suggest that to some degree resource use pressure has increased outside the park. The study employs a novel synthesis of OBIA and trend analysis that could be applied to land change studies more broadly.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSacred natural sites are considered an additional pillar for biodiversity conservation, next to the protected areas network. However, sacred landscapes are not primarily conservation areas, but exist for cultural and social reasons. To evaluate their strengths and weaknesses as community-based conservation areas, a thorough understanding of the underlying values, institutional arrangements, and outcomes is required. Here, I use institutional economics for a meta-analysis of publications on sacred natural sites to identify potential conflicts in their maintenance, and to analyze institutional arrangements to solve these conflicts. I show that most sacred natural sites resemble common-pool resources and that many design principles that are linked to common-pool resources are also found in traditional institutions managing sacred places. Design principles are no blue-print solution but they may guide future research to identify locally robust institutional arrangements that are linked to the ecological integrity of sacred natural sites.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Sacred natural sites exist for spiritual, cultural, social, economic, and ecological values. \xe2\x96\xba Biodiversity conservation is a concomitant value of sacred natural sites. \xe2\x96\xba Several conflicts of resource management may affect biodiversity negatively. \xe2\x96\xba Interdisciplinary research is required to improve conservation plans of SNS.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe role of well-functioning markets for development is now widely recognized. However the challenge remains to make these markets benefit the poor and the environment. Increasing attention is being given to the potential role markets can play for agrobiodiversity conservation through product diversification and increasing competitiveness in niche and novelty markets. Several case studies were undertaken that explore the use of market-based approaches to on-farm agrobiodiversity management and livelihood improvement. This paper explores how the theory of collective action can provide a more synthetic understanding of how market chains operate, and the changes that could permit a more equitable distribution of benefits. The case studies illustrate the need for improved trust, mutual understanding of each actor\xe2\x80\x99s involvement, and an agreed process of collective action with a high level of community participation. The cases differ in their degree of collective action, the level of market organization and the ways in which handling, processing, and innovative marketing add value to the agrobiodiversity products.

Abstract: "AbstractBackgroundInequalities in risk of maternal deaths between high and low-income countries and within countries are the widest of any known health indicator. Understanding and addressing the factors underlying these inequalities are crucial for preventing avoidable maternal deaths.ObjectiveTo examine social and health system factors associated with maternal deaths in Wayanad, a less developed district of Kerala.MethodsThis was a qualitative study using a social autopsy tool covering all maternal deaths that occurred in Wayanad district from January 2010 to June 2011, and in-depth interviews with service providers at different levels.Results and conclusionsFourteen (14) of 15 maternal deaths reported during this period were included in the study. Women from the Scheduled Tribes accounted for a majority (64%) of maternal deaths, while constituting only 17% of the district's population. Thirteen of the 14 deaths took place after reaching a health facility.Interactions between multiple social vulnerabilities (geographic remoteness, poverty, fear of health system and gender norms) and health system factors acted in synergy to compound the negative effects of each other. Geographic distribution of different levels of emergency obstetric care resulted in loss of precious time in receiving emergency care. Failure of Emergency Obstetric Care facilities to perform most of the signal functions of emergency obstetric care, including not stabilizing women before referral was a major factor. The reasons for this failure were as much related to risk-averse attitudes of health providers as to limited availability of personnel, equipments, and supplies."

Abstract: "AbstractThis article investigates how varieties of knowledge about flooding contribute to a more effective flood management (FM) governance configuration in Chennai, India. Drawing on the assemblage perspective and using the configurations approach for socio-spatial analyses of the city, we trace the knowledge construction processes around two networked FM infrastructures, drawing out the different discourses, actor coalitions and processes of practice. We see how technical knowledge on storm water drains is embedded and transformed within the primary government network, and how complementary knowledges about the ery system are expressed through counter mappings by academic activists. Identifying potential intersections between these knowledge processes indicates a strong potential to link long-term water management strategies that would mutually contribute to addressing the city's issues of flood risks and drinking water scarcity. However, we find that the varieties of knowledge around Chennai's FM run in parallel networks with few intersections, presenting distinct institutional boundaries to cross-boundary knowledge sharing. Lastly, using integrated FM as a heuristic framework, we analyse the contributions of the different streams of knowledge and the remaining gaps in order to assess the potential of building up the interconnections in Chennai's FM configuration."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Transesterification were performed using anion exchange resin catalyst.\xe2\x80\xa2Process parameters affecting transesterification were optimized.\xe2\x80\xa2Engine performance was studied with pongamia oil diesel blend.AbstractBiodiesel is a clean-burning renewable substitute fuel for petroleum. Biodiesel could be effectively produced by transesterification reaction of triglycerides of vegetable oils with short-chain alcohols in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. Conventionally, biodiesel manufacturing processes employ strong acids or bases as catalysts. But, separation of the catalyst and the by-product glycerol from the product ester is too expensive to justify the product use as an automobile fuel. Hence heterogeneous catalysts are preferred. In this study, transesterification of pongamia oil with ethanol was performed using a solid ion-exchange resin catalyst. It is a macro porous strongly basic anion exchange resin. The process parameters affecting the ethyl ester yield were investigated. The reaction conditions were optimized for the maximum yield of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) of pongamia oil. The properties of FAEE were compared with accepted standards of biodiesel. Engine performance was also studied with pongamia oil diesel blend and engine emission characteristics were observed.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractStrict protected areas are a critical component in global biodiversity conservation, but the future of biodiversity conservation may well depend upon the ability to experiment successfully with a range of institutional forms, including those that permit human use. Here, we focus on forest commons in human-dominated landscapes and their role in biodiversity conservation at the same time as they provide livelihood benefits to users. Using a dataset of 59 forest commons located in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, we estimated tree species richness from plot vegetation data collected in each forest, and drew on interview data to calculate a livelihoods index indicating the overall contribution of each forest to villager livelihoods for firewood, fodder, and timber. We found that tree species richness and livelihoods were positively and significantly correlated (rho\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0.41, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001, N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa059). This relationship held regardless of forest type or country, though significance varied somewhat across these two factors. Further, both benefits were similarly associated with several drivers of social-ecological change (e.g., occupational diversity of forest users, total number of users, and forest size), suggesting identification of potential synergies and complexes of causal mechanisms for future attention. Our analysis shows that forest commons in South Asia, explicitly managed to provide livelihoods for local populations, also provide biodiversity benefits. More broadly, our findings suggest that although strict protected areas are effective tools for biodiversity conservation, a singular focus on them risks ignoring other resource governance approaches that can fruitfully complement existing conservation regimes.'

Here a pond on a large river terrace on the Gangetic Plain in northern India provides: an estimate of the proportion of sheet and rill erosion products that reaches a valley floor and, by analogy, the amount that reaches a channel that drains to a major river; and insights into the sensitivity of this delivery to climate change and land use. Comparison is made between the rate of delivery of the products of sheet and rill erosion to a valley floor with approximate sediment yield from gullies indicating that the latter is likely to be a more significant source of sediment. This is a pilot study and its limitations can guide future research. The construction of sediment budgets in many large catchments worldwide could potentially include the approach reported here. The study also contributes to understanding of human\xe2\x80\x93environment interactions, specifically with regard to sheet erosion of agricultural soils.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba River terraces can be a significant source of sediment in rivers. \xe2\x96\xba A method for estimating sediment delivery from terraces by sheet erosion is presented. \xe2\x96\xba Sensitivity to climate and land use changes of sheet erosion rates is evaluated. \xe2\x96\xba Gullies appear to be the main source of sediment on the Ganga terraces.'

Abstract: 'As rates of deforestation continue to rise in many parts of the tropics, the international conservation community is faced with the challenge of finding approaches which can reduce deforestation and provide rural livelihoods in addition to conserving biodiversity. Much of modern-day conservation is motivated by a desire to conserve \xe2\x80\x98pristine nature\xe2\x80\x99 in protected areas, while there is growing recognition of the long-term human involvement in forest dynamics and of the importance of conservation outside protected areas. Agroforestry \xe2\x80\x93 intentional management of shade trees with agricultural crops \xe2\x80\x93 has the potential for providing habitats outside formally protected land, connecting nature reserves and alleviating resource-use pressure on conservation areas. Here we examine the role of agroforestry systems in maintaining species diversity and conclude that these systems can play an important role in biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Dissemination of alternative energy technologies such as biogas in various parts of the world has rarely led to a success rate of 90%. This study in Sirsi block, Karnataka, south India, revealed that 43% of rural households (HH) had dung resources to operate biogas plants and 65% of them had already built biogas plants. 100% of the plants built were functioning satisfactorily and 85% of HH with biogas plants met all their cooking energy needs with biogas, improving the quality of life of women. The presence of multiple agencies in the dissemination network, participation of entrepreneurs competing to assist households in all aspects of biogas plant construction, commissioning, procuring subsidy, guaranteed performance and free servicing contributed to the high rate of success (of 100% of biogas plants being functional). Most biogas plants built had excess plant capacity, with cost implications. An observed shift in the design choice from mild steel floating drum design to fibre reinforced plastic-based floating drum design and then to a less expensive fixed dome model shows that rural households respond quickly to technological developments. The paper discusses the roles of various factors and their implications for future dissemination programmes.'

Decision-making documents in the Supreme Court and in one specific case of a bauxite mining conflict involving Vedanta in the Niyamgiri hills are studied to come to conclusions about how economic valuation of forests has moved through the political process. We argue that establishing NPV for forests is neither conducive to conservation nor to environmental justice for the following three reasons. The technical and political process of setting prices deepens and reproduces structural inequalities with negative distributive effects. NPV encourages economistic decision-making procedures that exclude participation. Finally NPV does not recognize or take into account cultural difference or plural values. We thus conclude that economic valuation of forest products and services has not managed to \xe2\x80\x9csave\xe2\x80\x9d forests in India and is not an effective or viable strategy for expressing the value of forests or for environmental conservation and environmental justice activism.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIdentifying the pattern of natural climate variability is of immense importance to delineate the effects of anthropogenic climate changes. Global and regional climates are suspected to vary, in unison or with delays, with the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) at decadal to centennial timescales. Here we show that the Indian summer monsoon rainfall correlates well with the temporal derivative of TSI on multi-decadal timescales. This linkage between the temporal derivative of TSI and the Indian summer monsoon is tested and corroborated both for the instrumental period (1871\xe2\x80\x932006) and for the last \xe2\x88\xbc300 years using a speleothem \xce\xb418O record representing rainfall in southwestern India.

Author: 'J.'

Abstract: 'Watershed management programmes, in terms of conservation planning over a large watershed, must identify the subsets of hydrologic units that are contributing most sediment load in the watershed. It is these priority or critical hydrologic units or sub-watersheds that need preferential soil and water conservation measures to reduce maximum sediment load in the watershed, particularly in arid/semi-arid fragile environments.The semi-quantitative method of the Sediment Yield Index (SYI) model, developed by the All India Soil and Land Use Survey of the Government of India for priority delineation in River Valley Projects, is used in India and studies have revealed that there is an overall reduction of sediment outflows of up to 60%.The paper describes a new concept of introducing Integrated Resources Units (IRUs) in the model. An IRU is the smallest, but viable, planning unit which leads to strategies ideally suited for scientific development of a watershed. The IRUs encompass all the relevant watershed resources, generated from map-, ground- and space-based systems, and is the strategic unit for assigning the erosivity and transportability values of the detached material in the SYI model for gradation of priority classes of sub-watersheds. The IRU approach is also helpful in monitoring the dynamic aspects of the watershed and the consequent redefinement of management strategies. The paper also envisages some future studies for watershed management policies.'

Abstract: 'AbstractJoint capture of multiple species by multiple fleets results in technical and economic interactions between fleets. This paper develops a bioeconomic model that incorporates interrelationships between fleets for a representative fishery in India. The study analyzes the impacts of overcapitalization on bio-economic sustainability. Results show that a continuation of the current fishing intensity would deplete most commercially important species in the near future. However, an optimal effort re-allocation between fleets would increase fishery profits substantially, although some species would remain unsustainable. The study demonstrates how the newly emerging, large bodies of fishery data can be used for management decisions in developing countries.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Problematises suggestions that contract farming is an inclusive alternative to land acquisition.\xe2\x80\xa2Resituates contract farming as another important form of land control in the land grabbing debate.\xe2\x80\xa2The livelihood implications of contract farming in India are poorly understood.\xe2\x80\xa2Unequal power relations render participating households vulnerable to indebtedness.AbstractIn the recent explosion of attention given to the land grabbing phenomenon, contract farming has been identified as a potentially inclusive alternative for smallholders to outright acquisition of farm land by agri-business capital. This paper responds to these claims by resituating contract farming as an equally important form of land control. The focus of the paper is a case study of potato contract farming in Maharashtra, India. While there is \xe2\x80\x98nothing new\xe2\x80\x99 about contract farming as a mode of agriculture production in India, its influence on patterns of agrarian change is poorly understood. Adopting an agrarian political economy-informed livelihoods approach, the paper argues that rather than an inclusive alternative to land grabbing, contract farming in the study site represents another way that capital is coming to control land in rural India, with just as important implications for agrarian livelihoods. While some individual households have improved their livelihoods through participation, the contract scheme acts to reinforce already existing patterns of inequality. In particular, the unequal power relations between firm and farmer skew the capture of benefits towards the firm, and render participating households vulnerable to indebtedness and loss of autonomy over land and livelihood decisions.'

Abstract: "Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The first ever global trait-based analysis of climate change vulnerability in reptiles\xe2\x80\xa2Data were collected for a random sample of 1498 reptiles.\xe2\x80\xa280.5% of species were highly sensitive to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Overall, 22% of species were found to be highly vulnerable to climate change.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change vulnerable species do not spatially overlap species listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List.AbstractOne-fifth of the world's reptiles are currently estimated as threatened with extinction, primarily due to the immediate threats of habitat loss and overexploitation. Climate change presents an emerging slow-acting threat. However, few IUCN Red List assessments for reptiles explicitly consider the potential role of climate change as a threat. Thus, climate change vulnerability assessments can complement existing Red List assessments and highlight further, emerging priorities for conservation action.Here we present the first trait-based global climate change vulnerability assessment for reptiles to estimate the climate change vulnerability of a random representative sample of 1498 species of reptiles. We collected species-specific traits relating to three dimensions of climate change, sensitivity, low adaptability, and exposure, which we combined to assess overall vulnerability.We found 80.5% of species highly sensitive to climate change, primarily due to habitat specialisation, while 48% had low adaptability and 58% had high exposure. Overall, 22% of species assessed were highly vulnerable to climate change. Hotspots of climate change vulnerability did not always overlap with hotspots of threatened species richness, with most of the vulnerable species found in northwestern South America, southwestern USA, Sri Lanka, the Himalayan Arc, Central Asia and southern India. Most families were found to be significantly more vulnerable to climate change than expected by chance.Our findings build on previous work on reptile extinction risk to provide an overview of the risk posed to reptiles by climate change. Despite significant data gaps for a number of traits, we recommend that these findings are integrated into reassessments of species' extinction risk, to monitor both immediate and slow-acting threats to reptiles."

Title: 'Modelling the topsoil carbon stock of agricultural lands with the Stochastic Gradient Treeboost in a semi-arid Mediterranean region'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock was estimated in a Mediterranean area using digital soil mapping techniques.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate, texture and land use were found to be important predictors.\xe2\x80\xa2The model used greatly improved SOC stock estimation compared to previous estimates.\xe2\x80\xa2The panchromatic band of Landsat ETM\xc2\xa0+ 7 was more predictive compared to NDVI.AbstractEfficient modelling methods to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have a pivotal importance as inputs for global carbon cycle studies and decision-making processes. However, laboratory analyses of SOC field samples are costly and time consuming. Global-scale estimates of SOC were recently made according to categorical variables, including land use and soil texture. Remote sensing (RS) data can contribute to the better modelling of the spatial distribution of SOC stock at a regional scale. In the present study, we used Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT) to estimate the topsoil (0\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0cm) SOC stock of a Mediterranean semiarid area (Sicily, Italy, 25,286\xc2\xa0km2). In particular, our study examined agricultural lands, which represent approximately 64% of the entire region. An extensive soil dataset (2202 samples, 1 profile/7.31\xc2\xa0km2 on average) was acquired from the soil database of Sicily. The georeferenced field observations were intersected with remotely sensed environmental data and other spatial data, including climatic data from WORLDCLIM, land cover from CORINE, soil texture, topography and derived indices. Finally, the SGT was compared to published global estimates (GSOC) and data from the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) Soil Grids by comparing the pseudo-regressions of the SGT, GSOC and ISRIC with soil observations. The mean SOC stock across the entire region that was estimated by GSOC and ISRIC was 3.9% lower and 46.2% higher compared to the SGT. The SGT efficiently predicted SOC stocks that were <\xc2\xa070\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 (corresponding to the 90th percentile of the observed values). On average, the coefficient of variation of the SGT model was 3.6% when computed on the whole dataset and remained lower than 23% when computed on a distribution basis. The SGT mean absolute error was 14.84\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01, 18.4% and 36.3% lower than GSOC and ISRIC, respectively. The mean annual rainfall, soil texture, land use, mean annual temperature and Landsat 7 ETM+ panchromatic Band 8 were the most important predictors of SOC stock. Finally, SOC stocks were estimated for each land cover class. SGT predicted SOC stock better than GSOC and ISRIC for most data. This resulted in a percentage of data in the prediction confidence interval\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa050% compared to the observed values of 71.4%, 65.8%, and 50.7% for SGT, GSOC, and SGT, respectively. This consisted of a higher R2 and a slope (\xce\xb2) that was closer to 1 for the pseudo-regression constructed with SGT compared to GSOC and ISRIC. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that the integration of RS with climatic and soil texture spatial data could strongly improve SOC prediction in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In addition, the panchromatic band of Landsat 7 ETM\xc2\xa0+ was more predictive compared to the conventionally used NDVI. This information is crucial to guiding decision-making processes, especially at a regional scale and/or in semi-arid Mediterranean areas. The model performance of the SGT could be further improved by adopting predictors with greater spatial resolutions. The results of the present experiment yield valuable information, especially for assessing climate change or land use change scenarios for SOC stocks and their spatial distribution.'

Title: 'Study of Land use/land Cover Dynamics through Classification Algorithms for Harangi Catchment Area, Karnataka State, INDIA\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: "AbstractIndustrialization and urbanization are mainly responsible for the conversion of significant amount of vegetation rich lands such as forests and wetlands into agricultural lands and human settlements. This land use and land cover change in turn has influence on various hydrological processes such as soil erosion rate, sediment deposition in rivers and dams and also stream flow pattern in a catchment. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of Land use and Land cover (LU/LC) changes is necessary to assess the impacts of change in the pattern of natural vegetation on the earth's environment. Satellite images can provide useful information regarding spatial and temporal variation of LU/LC in an area. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the dynamics of LU/LC changes using LISS-III data for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 of Harangi catchment, Coorg District, Karnataka State, India. Also, study compares three classification techniques such as Parallelepiped Algorithm, Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm and Maximum Likelihood Algorithm based on the value of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient to check the reliability of the methods in classifying images. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained by using Parellelepiped, Minimum distance to mean and Maximum likelihood algorithm for the year 2013 are 81.47% & 0.71, 78.67 & 0.68 and 89.36% & 0.81 respectively. Based on these results, it can be concluded that, among all the three techniques, the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm gave higher accuracy with high kappa coefficient and Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm gave lower accuracy. The LU/LC change detection results between years 2007 and 2013 indicated a drastic change in forest area, plantation and waste land among all other classes. The forest area decreased dramatically from 183.12 sq. km to 131.02 sq. km. Also, fallow land and water body are decreased from 68.89 sq. km to 42.63 sq. km and 6.71 sq. km to 3.82 sq. km respectively. In contrast, the plantation and waterlogged area are observed to have an increasing trend of about 56.07 sq. km to 146.55 sq. km and 17.99 sq. km to 23.81 sq. km. The urban area has been increased from 13.06 sq. km to 13.72 sq. km. The urbanization and agricultural activities are the major reasons for increase in plantation and urban area in an expense of decrease in forest area."

Using field visits, interviews with locals and experts, and literature reviews, we explored a successful programme of community-based groundwater recharge in three adjacent catchments (the Arvari, Sarsa and Baghani) in semi-arid north Rajasthan, India, led by the NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS) in order to determine how successes were achieved and could be replicated. TBS-led initiatives rebuilt traditional village governance structures and participation in community-designed and maintained water harvesting structures (WHSs), which were efficient both economically and in technical design using indigenous knowledge. Enhanced seasonal groundwater recharge enabled by WHSs regenerated aquatic, farmed and natural ecosystems, underpinning a positive cycle of interdependent social and economic regeneration. Locally appropriate, integrated social and technical solutions maintaining this positive cycle have increased the quality of ecosystems and the wellbeing of local people. We used the STEEP (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political) framework to stratify outcomes, exploring principles underpinning successful local and catchment-scale regeneration and drawing out lessons transferrable to similarly water-stressed regions.'

Title: 'Present and prospective role of bioenergy in regional energy system'
Author: 'T.V'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032100000022
Abstract: 'AbstractBioenergy is the energy released from the reaction of organic carbon material with oxygen. The organic material derived from plants and animals is also referred to as biomass. Biomass is a flexible feedstock capable of conversion into solid, liquid and gaseous fuels by chemical and biological processes. These intermediate biofuels (such as methane gas, ethanol, charcoal) can be substituted for fossil based fuels. Wood and charcoal are important as household fuels and for small scale industries such as brick making, cashew processing etc. The scarcity of biofuels has far reaching implications on the environment. Hence, expansion of bioenergy systems could be influential in bettering both the socio-economic condition and the environment of the region. This paper examines the present role of biomass in the region\xe2\x80\x99s (Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India) energy supply and calculates the potential for future biomass provision and scope for conversion to both modern and traditional fuels. Based on the detailed investigation of biomass resource availability and demand, we can categorise the Uttara Kannada District into two zones (a) Biomass surplus zone consisting of Taluks mainly from hilly area (b) Biomass deficit zone, consisting of thickly populated coastal Taluks such as Bhatkal, Kumta, Ankola, Honnavar and Karwar. Fuel wood is mainly used for cooking and horticulture residues from coconut, arecanut trees are used for water heating purposes. Most of the households in this region still use traditional stoves where efficiency is less than 10%. The present inefficient fuel consumption could be brought down by the usage of fuel efficient stoves (a saving of the order of 27%). Availability of animal residues for biogas generation in Sirsi, Siddapur, Yellapur Taluks gives a viable alternative for cooking, lighting fuel and a useful fertiliser. However to support the present livestock population, fodder from agricultural residues is insufficient in these Taluks. There is a need to supplement the fodder availability with fodder crops as successfully tried in Banavasi village by some progressive farmers.'

Title: 'Overcoming ecological barriers to tropical lower montane forest succession on anthropogenic grasslands: Synthesis and future prospects'
Author: 'A.M.T.A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714001893
Abstract: 'AbstractUnderstanding the ecological mechanisms that constrain forest succession in tropical degraded anthropogenic grasslands is a prerequisite for the design of techniques for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem processes. In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence, herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks. For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20\xc2\xa0m into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival. These experiments identified that the early-successional species Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and tree patches within established grasslands. We highlight the importance of further research on the ecology and biology of seed dispersers and seed predators, and expansion of knowledge on the regeneration traits of native tree species, for future refinements of this restoration strategy.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThere are plans to double the area of strictly protected tropical forest. This article suggests that the siting and management of such reserves are based on models of conservation inappropriate to developing countries, and that an ignorance of past and present tropical land use will prevent reserves achieving their major objective of conserving useful biodiversity. Strict preservation could also destroy the indigenous knowledge needed for ecosystem management. Multipurpose management and continued human use of tropical forests is a more effective and sustainable conservation policy for tropical developing countries. Rural communities should be actively and physically involved in the future productive management of tropical forests, rather than being induced or pressured into abandoning their forest heritage.'

We argue that the issue of equitable access to urban nature is embedded in the larger question of the Right to the City. We show how processes of urban growth that lead to a shrinking of the forested area are associated with a differentiation of the Right to the City, rather than a general consolidation of claims on space. Defence of the park is mobilised to redefine urban citizenship and leads to a form of graduated citizenship. This differentiates those who see their claims on urban space consolidated; those whose urban citizenship is degraded, and those for whom urban citizenship is denied.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba The Sanjay Gandhi National Park is located within the 20 million metropolis of Mumbai. \xe2\x96\xba No collaboration between park and city management has led to slum settlement within the park. \xe2\x96\xba We analyse the urban dwellers (\xe2\x80\x9ctribals\xe2\x80\x9d, slums, middle classes) in the park. \xe2\x96\xba The Right to the City is redefined in relation to environment. \xe2\x96\xba The urban political ecology framework is refined by our research at the local scale.'

Abstract: "AbstractStudy regionThe study is carried out for Mumbai (18\xc2\xb058\xe2\x80\xb230\xe2\x80\xb3 N, 72\xc2\xb049\xe2\x80\xb233\xe2\x80\xb3 E).Study focusFuture projections provided by general circulation models (GCMs) suggest the probability of occurrence of intense rainfall will change in the future. However, GCM data generally need to be downscaled and bias-corrected for impact studies. Although the domains covered by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are increasing, statistical downscaling of GCM results is the main alternative in many regions. We applied a Distribution-based Scaling (DBS) procedure, with 1975\xe2\x80\x932004 as a reference period, for bias-correcting and downscaling daily rainfall data from nine global climate projections.New hydrological insights for the regionThe evaluation in the reference period showed that the scaled data are able to represent various key statistics. All GCMs were unable to accurately reproduce the southwest monsoon season. Using the transient DBS processed projection data, a comprehensive evaluation of key rainfall statistics was performed for three periods: near (2010\xe2\x80\x932040), intermediate (2041\xe2\x80\x932070) and distant future (2071\xe2\x80\x932099). There is an increase in the total accumulated annual rainfall, ranging from 300 to 500\xc2\xa0mm in the ensemble. Also, a clear seasonal shift and delayed onset of the monsoon season evolves in the projections, with increasing and decreasing rainfall in September and June, respectively. A trend analysis using Student's t and Mann\xe2\x80\x93Kendall tests was performed for 2010\xe2\x80\x932099. A significant positive trend was found for four of the GCM projections."

Title: 'Short communicationAssessment of the impacts of vehicular emissions on urban air quality and its management in Indian context: the case of Kolkata (Calcutta)'
Author: 'Mrinal K.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAir quality crisis in cities is mainly due to vehicular emissions. Transportation systems are increasing everywhere and the improvements in technology are insufficient to counteract growth. This paper examines the effect of vehicular emission on urban air quality and human health, and focuses on the unique features of an Indian mega city regarding its air pollution. A fact-finding survey was conducted to evaluate the status of air pollution at traffic intersections and the problem arising out of vehicular emissions in the study area. All the key pollutants are in excess of permitted levels. The severe detrimental effects of this pollution are reviewed. The problems have reached threatening dimensions. Vulnerable analysis (VA) has been carried out to evaluate the air pollution stress at different locations within the study area. Options for controlling mobile sources emissions are discussed and a strategic motor vehicle control strategy has been proposed to mitigate the air pollution in the city. Replacement of old vehicles, reformulating diesel fuel, introduction of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG), massive improvements in infrastructure and radical traffic management measures are among the actions that will need to be brought together to achieve this objective.'

Abstract: 'AbstractConcerns over climate change, fossil fuel depletion, and increase in natural gas prices have sparked a great interest in various forms of renewable energy and its imposition, particularly in developing countries. Biomass is utilized as number one energy resource for developing countries, supplying energy to households for cooking purposes, and signifying about 70\xe2\x80\x9380% of the global bioenergy contributions. India has vast biomass resources and wasteland to support cultivation of bioenergy crops, the potential of that can be harnessed to resolve energy crisis. Bioenergy can contribute to energy security whilst also decreasing the emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. The objective of this review is to give an overview of biomass energy potential and its utilization in India, state of the art of the technologies used for biomass conversion, and latest development in biomass conversion technologies.'

Title: 'Hydroelectric resource assessment in Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India'
Author: 'T.V.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652698000766
Abstract: "AbstractThe amount of power available at a given site is decided by the volumetric flow of water and the hydraulic head or water pressure. In hydro schemes, the turbines that drive the electricity generators are directly powered either from a reservoir or the `run of the river'. The large schemes may include a water storage reservoir providing daily or seasonal storage to match the production with demand for electricity. These schemes have been producing power in Karnataka for many years, with the first hydroelectric station built in 1942. The majority of them are in Uttara Kannada district. Due to environmental constraints, further construction of storage reservoirs is limited and attention has been focussed towards developing environmental friendly small-scale hydro schemes to cater for the needs of the region. In this paper, the assessment of potential carried out in the streams of Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins in Uttara Kannada district of Western Ghats is discussed. Potentials at five feasible sites are assessed based on stream gauging carried out for a period of 18 months. Computations of discharge on empirical/rational method based on 90 years of precipitation data and the subsequent power and energy values computed are in conformity with the power calculations based on stream gauging. It is estimated that, if all streams are harnessed for energy, electricity generated would be in the order of 720 and 510 million units in Bedthi and Aghnashini basins, respectively. This exercise provides insight to meeting the regional energy requirement through integrated approaches, like harnessing hydro power in a decentralized way during the monsoon season, and meeting lean season requirements through small storage, solar or other thermal options. Net energy analyses incorporating biomass energy lost in submergence show that maximization in net energy at a site is possible, if the hydroelectric generation capacity is adjusted according to the seasonal variations in the river's water discharge."

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We investigated how forest cover and management intensification affect large mammal use of cacao agroforests.\xe2\x80\xa2Management intensification had a stronger effect, negatively affecting a larger number of species.\xe2\x80\xa2Increasing frequencies of domestic dogs in cacao agroforests is particularly negative for mammals.\xe2\x80\xa2Increasing canopy connectivity among shade trees benefits species of regional conservation concern.\xe2\x80\xa2Drivers of large mammals response may change in deforested landscapes.AbstractChanges in biodiversity and ecosystem services in terrestrial systems are being driven by the synergistic interactions between the loss of native vegetation and land-use intensification. Disentangling the influence of these two processes on species persistence is an important step towards reconciling conservation and agriculture production. We investigated how forest cover and management intensification affect the conservation value of cacao agroforests for mammals in an Atlantic forest landscape in southern Bahia, the most extensive area of diverse shaded cacao plantations in Brazil. Although both factors affected the distribution of mammal species, management intensification had a stronger effect, negatively affecting a larger number of species. Frequency of domestic dogs, an indirect aspect of management intensification, negatively affected four species and lower connectivity of shading trees decreased the use of cacao agroforests by three species of conservation concern. In comparison, the reduced forest cover negatively affected two species of conservation concern. Our results suggest that controlling domestic dog populations is particularly valuable for large mammal conservation in agroforestry mosaics, since it does not affect crop productivity. Improving shade cover within agroforests, on the other hand, should be implemented carefully, maintaining acceptable yield while promoting canopy connectivity and the recruitment of tree species used by forest dependent mammals. However, the importance of both local management intensification and local forest cover are likely to be context dependent, and changes in their relative importance are likely to occur with different levels of deforestation at the landscape scale.'

Title: 'Tapping latex and alleles? The impacts of latex and bark harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus (Apocynaceae)'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We studied the effects of harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus.\xe2\x80\xa2High levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding were observed in all populations.\xe2\x80\xa2A reduction of genetic diversity was detected in high-harvested populations.\xe2\x80\xa2Suggestions for conservation of the genetic diversity of H. drasticus were provided.AbstractThe importance of genetic variation for maintaining biological diversity and evolutionary processes is widely accepted; however, limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity in natural populations. Until recently, it was assumed that the exploitation of non-timber forest products, such as fruits, barks and exudates, had low environmental impact, but recognition that the harvesting of these plants can affect several biological levels, including genetic diversity and structure, has been growing. Nevertheless, the effect of harvesting non-timber forest products on the genetic diversity of the harvested species is poorly understood. The objective of this work is to assess the impact of harvesting on the genetic diversity of Himatanthus drasticus (Apocynaceae), a tree of the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) that is highly exploited for its medicinal latex. We tested the hypothesis that harvesting can cause a trade-off between survival and reproduction in H. drasticus, reducing the effective population size as well as the genetic diversity in highly exploited populations. The study was conducted in the Araripe National Forest, a preserved Cerrado area in Cear\xc3\xa1 State, Brazil. We sampled six populations that included two different levels of harvesting (high-harvest and low-harvest) and characterized the genetic diversity and structure in two groups (adults and seedlings) using microsatellite markers. We verified high levels of polymorphism in H. drasticus; however, significant levels of inbreeding in all studied populations were also observed. We found a higher degree of genetic structure in the seedling group when compared with the adult group, a difference that was most likely due to seed rain deposited in nearby locations. No differences were detected in adult genetic diversity levels between populations under different harvesting intensities. However, seedling allelic richness was significantly lower in the high-harvested populations, indicating allelic losses that may be associated with the exploitation of bark and latex. Evidence of genetic loss due to overharvesting was supported by significant bottleneck signatures observed in the seedling group of two out of three high-harvest populations. The establishment of a conservation strategy is imperative to avoid future genetic losses and ensure the long-term viability of H. drasticus populations. The information obtained in this study has been integrated with ecological information about the effects of latex tapping on phenology, demography and biomass recovery of exploited populations, with the goal of proposing a sustainable management plan for the species.'

Title: 'AnalysisPoverty and biodiversity: Measuring the overlap of human poverty and the biodiversity hotspots'
Author: 'Brendan'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800906002916
Abstract: 'AbstractIn an effort to prioritize conservation efforts, scientists have developed the concept of biodiversity hotspots. Since most hotspots occur in countries where poverty is widespread, the success of conservation efforts depends upon the recognition that poverty can be a significant constraint on conservation, and at the same time conservation is an important component to the alleviation of long-term poverty. In this paper we present five key socio-economic poverty indicators (access to water, undernourishment, potential population pressure, number living below poverty line and debt service) and integrate them with an ecologically based hotspots analysis in order to illustrate magnitude of the overlap between biological conservation and poverty. The analysis here suggests that the overlap between severe, multifaceted poverty and key areas of global biodiversity is great and needs to be acknowledged. Understanding the magnitude of overlap and interactions among poverty, conservation and macroeconomic processes is crucial for identifying illusive, yet possible, win\xe2\x80\x93win solutions.'

Abstract: "AbstractNormally privatization is resorted to by different economies for different reasons \xe2\x80\x94 resource mobilization, introducing efficiency by promoting competition, and for achieving commercial orientation. Often these are assumed to be independent objectives. The Indian experience is showing that they are quite interdependent and unless all the three objectives are tackled simultaneously, privatization will not succeed. Specifically, the poor financial performance of the state electricity boards and their lack of commercial orientation is applying a brake on investment in the power sector by foreign IPPs. Similarly the government's approach to privatization without promoting competition \xe2\x80\x94 through the so-called Memorandum of Understanding \xe2\x80\x94 is leading to high cost solutions and acrimonious public debates demanding transparency in decision making and review of those already made."

Author: 'Sunil'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925506001259
Abstract: 'AbstractThe high elevational areas in the Himalayas of India are dominated by forests and alpine pastures. There are many protected areas in the region, including Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) and Valley of Flowers (VOF) where natural resource management plan (NRMP) has been implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. This has affected the traditional animal husbandry system, as well as the vegetation dynamics of alpine pastures. An integrated approach to studying the impact of NRMP in the region has been applied by us. First, a survey was conducted regarding livestock management, data pertaining the livestock husbandry, the role of animal husbandry in economics of rural household, and socioeconomics. Second, field based study on phytosociology of some important alpine herbs was done to enumerate the density and species richness in different land mark of the region. Thereafter, satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to develop a land cover map of the area and to note changes in the landscape over time after implementation of NRMP. From an economic point of view the implementation of such plan is a setback to the rural economy. However, the ecological perspective of such models is a threat to the diversity of alpine pastures. The invasion of bushes/thorny bushes/shrubs and weeds with their luxuriant growth is changing the vegetation index and dynamics. Consequently, the diversity of herbs in alpine pastures of the Himalayan Mountains is in jeopardy. Overall, the situation is leading to landscape change in the region. This study is helpful for generating useful outcomes and strategies considering the question or debate \xe2\x80\x9cis grazing good or bad for pasture ecosystems in the Himalayas?\xe2\x80\x9d.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSatellite L-band synthetic aperture radar backscatter data from 1996 and 2007 (from JERS-1 and ALOS PALSAR respectively), were used with field data collected in 2007 and a back-calibration method to produce biomass maps of a 15\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0km2 forest\xe2\x80\x93savanna ecotone region of central Cameroon. The relationship between the radar backscatter and aboveground biomass (AGB) was strong (r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.86 for ALOS HV to biomass plots, r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.95 relating ALOS-derived biomass for 40 suspected unchanged regions to JERS-1 HH).

Analysis of the errors involved showed that radar data can detect changes in broad AGB class in forest\xe2\x80\x93savanna transition areas with an accuracy >\xc2\xa095%. However, quantitative assessment of changes in AGB in Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa01 at a pixel level will require radar images from sensors with similar characteristics collecting data from the same season over multiple years.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Table 1 provides the most comprehensive literature review to date: 100 conflict cases.\xe2\x80\xa2Mining conflicts are on the rise in India over the past 20 years.\xe2\x80\xa2Small-scale sand mining, often illegal, generated the largest number of conflicts.\xe2\x80\xa2Conflicts over metal extraction pit local populations against large corporations.\xe2\x80\xa2The causes were often environmental, especially related to water and livelihoods.AbstractMineral extraction is growing worldwide, generating serious social and environmental impacts, and in the process, sparking significant resistance. The present article provides the first overview of non-fuel mining conflicts in India. The analysis is based on 100 cases of conflicts that occurred between 1992 and 2014, which constitutes the most exhaustive database compiled to date. In each case, location, mineral extracted, actors involved, cited causes of protest, conflict duration and outcomes were recorded. We found that the commodity responsible for the most conflicts is sand, the extraction of which is widespread and often carried out illegally by small-scale actors near rivers. Resistance against metallic ore mining, in contrast, typically pits local populations against larger corporations. Most resistance movements are composed of subaltern rural and/or indigenous populations; very few national and international NGOs were found to be involved in local movements. The causes of such conflicts have largely been ecological and responsible for an undermining of local livelihoods. Mineral extraction is expected to increase in India over the next decade, and with it, the number of associated conflicts.'

Title: 'Fire supported forest utilisation of a degraded dry forest as a means of sustainable local forest management in Tamil Nadu/South India'
Author: 'Joachim'

Abstract: "AbstractWhen scientific forest management was introduced in India under British rule in the second half of the 19th century, it provoked great controversy. Intense discussion surrounded the effect fire had on sustainable forestry. Based upon a 2-year empirical survey in the Kadavakurichi Hillock area of the Dindigul District of Tamil Nadu, this paper revisits that earlier debate. The data show that despite shortcomings in tree growth, areas consisting predominantly of forests largely degraded by frequent fire can satisfy the needs of the local population. The various forms of land use practised in these areas are sustainable at low levels, particularly non-timber forest produce management. Statistical analysis and prognosis indicate that local forest use and management through frequent fire should be able to support this region's livelihood under the prevailing poor environmental conditions as well as into the future. The positive aspects of the traditional fire management regime are discussed against the prevailing paradigm of fire prevention."

Abstract: 'AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceIt is becoming increasingly clear that ethnopharmacology cannot be disassociated from food production, human nutrition and the conservation of the biodiversity that constitutes its resource base.Aim of the studyThis paper aims to provide a perspective of ethnopharmacology that explicitly extends the range of disciplines it covers so as to embrace food and nutrition and the biodiversity basis, both wild and agricultural, and also places it in the context of the dramatic changes to our planet that we are experiencing during a period of rapid global change and the impacts that these changes are having on human health and nutrition and on its resource base.Materials and methodsA review is made of recent initiatives and developments that show linkages between ethnopharmacology, agriculture, food production, nutrition and biodiversity conservation.ResultsEthnopharmacology, biodiversity, agriculture, food and nutrition are inextricably linked but suffer from compartmentalization and a lack of communication which have to be overcome if progress is to be made. Fortunately, a convergence of interest between the agricultural biodiversity and the biodiversity conservation sectors has emerged in recent years and there is an increased appreciation of the need to adopt a wider approach to human nutrition than the conventional agricultural model allows; there is also a greater awareness of the important role played by diversity of crops, especially local species, and consumption of wild species in achieving balanced nutrition. An increased recognition of the key role of local communities in managing agricultural biodiversity is evident. While ethnopharmacologists have expressed concern at the relentless loss of biodiversity, there has been little direct involvement but it is perhaps now time to consider a more proactive role. Attention is also drawn to the need to assess the implications of global change for ethnopharmacology.ConclusionsEthnopharmacologists need to take much more cognizance of the fate of the resource base \xe2\x80\x93 the plants, animals and microorganisms \xe2\x80\x93 and of the actions being undertaken under the auspices of treaties, such as the Conservation on Biological Diversity and its Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, to counter its degradation and loss. In addition, they should play a more active role in determining the actions needed to assess, monitor and conserve the resource base. Although it has been suggested that the \xe2\x80\x98golden days\xe2\x80\x99 of ethnopharmacology may be over, it is proposed that by embracing the challenges of broadening the remit so as to include the health aspects of wild biodiversity employed in nutrition, a new \xe2\x80\x98golden age\xe2\x80\x99 beckons.

Along with the physico-chemical parameters they were also analysed for 10 heavy metals namely As, Mn, Ni, Se, Fe, Cu, Cd, Co, Cr and Pb in which except As, Mn, Ni and Se rest of the elements were below detection level. The concentrations (ppb) of highly toxic metals viz., As, Ni, Mn and Se ranged from 0.0 to 200, 0.0 to 80, 0.0 to 4200 and 30 to 140 respectively which are above the acceptable limits as per BIS/WHO standards for drinking purpose. ANOVA showed that pH, TDS, EC, Total alkalinity, Total hardness, Cl-, SO42-, F-, Na+ and Se showed significant variation at 0.05 significance level. Hydrochemistry was dominated by calcium, bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate in the study area. These facts are also supported by PCA and correlation. The order of relative abundance of the anions was Cl-> SO42->NO3->F->PO43- and for cations was Ca2+~Na+>Mg2+>K+. Zonal variation revealed that as compared to rural, peri-urban and urban zones, industrial and commercial zones had degraded water quality. As depicted from Water Quality Index (WQI) 80% of sampling locations have poor water quality, 7% very poor water quality, 4% unfit for drinking and only 9% out of the 44 sampling locations have good water quality. Health risk assessment signifies the probability of the noncarcinogenic effect due to the presence of arsenic and selenium as compared to carcinogenic effect is more for the residents of the study area.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (230KB)Download full-size image'

Title: 'Reuse of iron ore mineral wastes in civil engineering constructions: A case study'
Author: 'Mohan'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344908001110
Abstract: 'AbstractTo make mining activities more eco-friendly, it is important to conduct mining operations in a manner that is more environmentally friendly, economically feasible and socially acceptable. The volume of solid waste generated, including tailings from mineral processing activities, is one of the main pollution concerns in the mining industry. In the tiny state of Goa (India), it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space for dumping these huge volumes. And therefore ways of utilizing mine waste need to be found. This paper examines the suitability of these wastes for use in construction. Studies by others were reviewed where it was found that these wastes contain acid producing mineral phases and high concentrations of heavy metals. The presence of such concentrations can jeopardize the environment, if management of these wastes is not addressed with due consideration and care. Particle size classification on these wastes suggests that mine wastes contain coarse-grained rock, sand, silt and clays. A number of tests were then conducted on the aggregate part of mine wastes and the physico-mechanical properties were obtained. According to the results obtained the mean values of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of concrete cubes after 28 days of curing was found to be of the order of 21.93 and 19.91\xc2\xa0MPa with mine aggregate and granite aggregate, respectively. Through toxicity leaching procedure tests the study also confirmed that the hydraulic binder arrests metal mobility from these wastes. This paper does not discuss the economic aspects as that was beyond the scope of the research. However, to some extent socio-economic perspective of mine waste utilization has been presented and discussed.'

Author: 'Philip E.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534711000206
Abstract: 'Increasing evidence highlights the role that botanic gardens might have in plant invasions across the globe. Botanic gardens, often in global biodiversity hotspots, have been implicated in the early cultivation and/or introduction of most environmental weeds listed by IUCN as among the worst invasive species worldwide. Furthermore, most of the popular ornamental species in living collections around the globe have records as alien weeds. Voluntary codes of conduct to prevent the dissemination of invasive plants from botanic gardens have had limited uptake, with few risk assessments undertaken of individual living collections. A stronger global networking of botanic gardens to tackle biological invasions involving public outreach, information sharing and capacity building is a priority to prevent the problems of the past occurring in the future.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIt is well known that energy consumption is rapidly increasing due to population growth, higher standard of living and increased production. Significant amounts of energy resources are being consumed by the transportation sector leading to the fast depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. Biodiesel is one of the technically and economically feasible options to tackle the aforesaid problems. Biodiesel is produced mainly from edible oils. However, it is believed that the extensive use of edible oils for biodiesel production may lead to food shortages in most of the developing countries. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review the necessity and potentiality of the non-edible oils and to identify the emerging technologies to produce biodiesel.

Abstract: 'AbstractSince 1984, bulk precipitation samples have been collected at Pune, a tropical urban location in India, in the monsoon season. Data from these studies are used to analyze the long-term trends in the major chemical constituents of precipitation. Significantly increasing trends were observed for SO4 and NO3 which could be attributed to the rise in industrial and vehicular activities during this period. Also Ca, the chief neutralizing constituent, showed decreasing trend, mainly due to the rapid urbanization that reduced the availability of open land which is the major source for Ca. This has resulted in the overall decrease in trend of pH. However, the average pH value is still in the alkaline range due to the dominance of neutralizing potential of precipitation over the acidic potential.'

Title: 'Analysis of the relationship between rainfall and economic growth in Indian states\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'M.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Relationships between rainfall and economic growth are reviewed.\xe2\x80\xa2For India, correlation of rainfall-growth relationships vary between states.\xe2\x80\xa2Investment in irrigation is associated with reduced rainfall-growth correlation.\xe2\x80\xa2More reliable groundwater use is not associated with reduced correlation.\xe2\x80\xa2Economic diversification from agriculture is not related to reduced correlation.AbstractThe relationship between rainfall variability and economic growth is complex, and tends to be significant in economies like India where agriculture plays a major role in economic output and food security. This paper seeks to provide insight into this relationship using Indian state-level economic and rainfall data from 1961 to 2012. We examine all 15 Indian states with populations exceeding 20m as of 2000, totalling 920m people, about 12% of the global population. Physical and human geography vary greatly between, and even within, these states, reflecting the global range of water security challenges and providing an analogue for a range of global economic development and environmental conditions. We identify three patterns of interdependence between rainfall variability and economic growth: i) Continuous Correlation of rainfall and economic growth rates, ii) Decayed Correlation from a significant to an insignificant relationship, and iii) Never Correlated i.e. no significant observable correlation between rainfall and growth. Sensitivity to rainfall variability is somewhat less in wetter states. Investment in irrigation infrastructure has helped states to reduce their economic sensitivity to rainfall variability, with three of the four states that have Decayed Correlation of growth with rainfall having the highest percentage expansion in irrigated areas of the 15 states. Greater use of groundwater supplies (rather than surface water) does not, however, appear to influence the sensitivity of economic growth to rainfall variability. The relationship between rainfall-growth correlation and long term income is complex; states which are correlated generally appear to be growing faster than states which are not correlated, but that growth is occurring from a lower per capita income level. Finally, confirming national trends for India, the paper does not find that economic diversification away from agriculture has reduced economic sensitivity to rainfall variability. The observation that growth in economically-diversified states can still be dependent on rainfall invites further research into the ways in which rainfall either directly, or through other hydro-climatic variables, influences the general economy.'

Abstract: 'SummaryUnderstanding of the role and potential of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for livelihood improvement and conservation has been hindered by a lack of a clear theoretical framework and a functional typology of cases. To help fill this gap, we did a comparative analysis of 61 cases of commercial NTFP production in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Cases were documented using a standardized set of descriptors organized into categories describing various aspects of the production-to-consumption system. Exploratory analysis yielded useful case groupings by (a) household economic strategy and (b) NTFP production strategy. These groups and their key characteristics are used as a basis for discussing the development and conservation implications of NTFPs.'

Title: 'Regional inventory of soil surface nitrogen balances in Indian agriculture (2000\xe2\x80\x932001)'
Author: 'V. Krishna'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479704001549
Abstract: 'AbstractNitrogen regulates several ecological and biogeochemical processes and excess reactive nitrogen in the environment can lead to pollution problems, including the deterioration of air quality, disruption of forest processes, acidification of lakes and streams, and degradation of coastal waters. Much of the excess nitrogen inputs are related to food and energy production. An important step to understanding the sources of nitrogen and ultimately defining solutions to excess nitrogen is to describe the geographic distribution of agricultural nitrogen contributions from different regions. In this study, soil surface nitrogen loads were quantified for different states of India for the period 2000\xe2\x80\x932001. Nearly 35.4\xc2\xa0Tg of nitrogen has been estimated as inputs from different sources, with output nitrogen from harvested crops of about 21.20\xc2\xa0Tg. The soil surface nitrogen balance, estimated as inputs minus outputs, is found to be about 14.4\xc2\xa0Tg surplus from the agricultural land of India. Livestock manure constituted a major percentage of total inputs (44.06%), followed by inorganic fertilizer (32.48%), atmospheric deposition (11.86%) and nitrogen fixation (11.58%). Nitrogen balance varied from deficit to surplus for different states. The highest nitrogen surplus was found in Uttar Pradesh (2.50\xc2\xa0Tg) followed by Madhya Pradesh (1.83\xc2\xa0Tg), Andhra Pradesh (1.79\xc2\xa0Tg), etc. A negative nitrogen balance was found in Orissa (\xe2\x88\x920.01\xc2\xa0Tg), Andaman Nicobar Islands (\xe2\x88\x920.32\xc2\xa0Tg) and for some of the northeastern states. Major fertilizer consumption states were found to be Tamilnadu (204\xc2\xa0kg/ha), Haryana (132\xc2\xa0kg/ha), Punjab (148\xc2\xa0kg/ha), followed by others. Similarly, nitrogen inputs from total livestock excretions were found to be high for Kerala (616\xc2\xa0kg/ha), Jammu and Kashmir (389\xc2\xa0kg/ha), Tamil Nadu (338\xc2\xa0kg/ha), etc. The average nitrogen surplus of about 54\xc2\xa0kg/ha observed for the agricultural land of the entire country of India is comparatively higher than the average surplus of about 31\xc2\xa0kg/ha reported for European countries. These results, obtained from nutrient mass balance calculations, will be useful to formulate nutrient management plans relating to fertilizer usage, livestock management and for adopting some best management strategies at a state level in India.'

Author: 'J.G.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe role of irrigation in India in expanding crop production, reducing output instability and providing protection against periodic drought has been a major factor in the substantial achievement of Indian agriculture over the past four decades. Irrigated crop yields are, however, only half those obtained elsewhere in Asia and if growth rates are to be maintained in the face of increasing technical, environmental and social limits being placed on the availability of water, the need to increase productivity per unit of water is a key issue. India is now faced with a number of critical choices in irrigation management. The choice lies between a continuation of the present, possibly diminishing, agricultural growth rate, or a widespread reform and renewal of irrigation management practices. Food production in India will become increasingly dependent upon irrigation. Over 55% of agricultural output is from irrigated lands and production from rainfed areas is faced with lack of land for expansion and the prevailing risk of drought. The pricing environment, rural infrastructure and services are also fundamental to agricultural growth, but the resolution of water constraints enabled by irrigation is the key for productive capability.'

Title: 'Importance of non-timber forest products in the economic valuation of dry deciduous forests of India'
Author: 'Ajay Kumar'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389934104000231
Abstract: 'AbstractThe production and marketing of non-timber goods (NTFP) and services gained importance in forest management as demand for these increased considerably. However, due to lack of relevant information on the level of output of non-timber products, its economic significance was seldom accounted for in the valuation of forests. Dry deciduous forests in India is one such typical case where forest valuation is yet to integrate the NTFP stock, widely used for subsistence and cash income. A detailed accounting of commercially valuable forest products harvested from dry deciduous forests of Eastern India was made to highlight the economic worth of forests and contribution of NTFPs. The net present value of revenues from NTFP was estimated to be US$ 1016 ha\xe2\x88\x921 in the coastal area and US$ 1348/ha in the inland area, which proved to be significantly higher than the returns from alternative land uses. Dry deciduous forests were estimated to have more value than had been assumed previously and compared favourably against potential timber revenue (US$ 268 ha\xe2\x88\x921). The result indicates the necessity of developing a new valuation protocol for use by forest managers while deciding conversion of forest lands for non-forestry purposes.'

The aspects examined include generation of knowledge, process of learning, the institutional arrangement, networking among various institutions and the role of the government. The paper reflects the importance of each type of actor and the government support at research and all the more at production and diffusion levels. It brings out the reasons which necessitated adoption of the new technology (plant tissue culture) in the case of cardamom and the success achieved in its commercialisation.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis study analyzed the energy and economics associated with cultivation of traditional and introduced crops in the mountains of the Central Himalaya, India. The production cost in terms of energy for introduced crops such as tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) cultivation was 90,358\xe2\x80\x93320,516\xc2\xa0MJ\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 as compared to between 19,814 and 42,380\xc2\xa0MJ\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 for traditional crops within Himalayan agroecosystems. For the introduced crops, high energy and monetary input was associated with human labor, forest resources, chemical fertilizer and pesticides. However, energy threshold/projection for farmyard manure in traditional crop cultivation was 80\xe2\x80\x9390% of the total energy cost, thus traditional crop cultivation was more efficient in energy and economics. During the study, the farm productivity of introduced crops cultivation declined with increasing years of cultivation. Consequently, the energy output from the system has been declining at the rate of \xe2\x88\x92y20,598 to y20,748\xc2\xa0MJ\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921 for tomato and y12,072 to y15,056\xc2\xa0MJ\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921 for bell pepper under irrigated and rain-fed land use in the mountains, respectively. The comparative analysis on this paradigm shift indicates that more research is needed to support sustainable crop cultivation in the fragile Himalayan environment.'

Abstract: "AbstractThis article deals with the migration of Bangladeshi village women to the bars of Bombay. For about twelve years (1992 to 2003), ladies' bars provided a lucrative source of income for young women from villages of Jessore and Satkhira. With the money they earned, families were enriched and village economies were invigorated. From being burdens to their families because of the dowry required for their marriage, daughters became assets; wives provided for their husbands, daughters-in-law sustained parents-in-law and sisters established their siblings. No one could deny the widespread benefits of women's migration to Bombay. But how could their activity be reconciled with village norms requiring women to restrain their movements, show modesty and remain under the authority of guardians? How could women's migration be accommodated with village religion and principles of life held to be fundamental to an Islamic way of life and to the good order of society? How could women's earnings be enjoyed without reprobation or disturbances?"

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper examines innovation and knowledge generation processes and the supporting role of intellectual property rights (IPR) both for systematized investigative science and traditional community led activities. Options for protection of traditional knowledge and life materials and processes are suggested. It is suggested that the systematic and logical merging of ideas from conventions like TRIPs, convention of biodiversity (CBD), and union pour la protection des obtentitous vegetales (UPOV) can lead to the creation of harmonized provisions that could satisfy basic and minimum standards of IPR and societal ethics. The need for the unambiguous definition of discovery and invention in the granting of patents for biotechnological investigations is explored, as well as the issues of the establishment of prior art from unstructured traditional knowledge, identifying legal owners of traditional knowledge and evaluating prior art in this domain. The imperative task of creating a structured knowledge database of traditional practices and linking them through global networks is highlighted.

Title: 'Managing mistletoes: The value of local practices for a non-timber forest resource'
Author: 'Lucy'

Abstract: 'AbstractSustainable harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and associated livelihood security can be affected by forest disturbances additional to harvesting. Amla (Phyllanthus emblica and Phyllanthus indofischeri) is a locally and nationally significant NTFP in India, exploited for its fruit. We examined the infection of these two species by a hemiparasitic mistletoe and investigated two alternative management approaches.Forest surveys, mistletoe removal experiments and seed deposition surveys were employed to assess the prevalence of mistletoe infection, characteristics of infection in relation to resource value and the appropriateness of local versus institutional management approaches. The results suggest mistletoe infection is widespread in the study site, affecting over half of the Amla population, and in particular those reproductive trees important for population persistence. Infection characteristics and resource values differ between the two Phyllanthus species, having significant implications for Amla collectors. Institutional perspectives on the management of this species conflict with local practice. Cutting of branches by collectors has previously been considered destructive, but may in fact have management benefits in terms of increased productivity through re-sprouts and reduced risk of mistletoe infection. However, neither mistletoe removal by hand, nor branch cutting appear to offer a viable control strategy in isolation. A multifarious strategy including new approaches to management is needed to safeguard the role of this resource in local livelihoods.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA generalised linear model was used to predict climatically suitable habitat for the golden bowerbird (Prionodura newtonia De Vis), an endemic species of the Wet Tropics of North Queensland. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean precipitation of the wettest quarter were found to be the best habitat predictors. For independent validation data, accuracy was 67% (Kappa statistic, n=30). Past, and future habitats suitable to the golden bowerbird were mapped by altering the temperature and precipitation input to the model. In the current climate, total potential habitat is estimated to be 1564 km2, occurring as a number of separate patches with distinct bowerbird subpopulations. Past habitat was most limiting, 406 km2, during the Holocene climatic optimum (c. 5000\xe2\x80\x933600 YBP, +2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C and +50% rainfall relative to today). With future warming, assuming a 10% decrease in rainfall, potential habitat is reduced to 582 km2 (1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C warming), 163 km2 (2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C warming) and 37 km2 (3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C warming). Thus, global warming in the coming decades is likely to be a significant threat to the survival of this and similar upland and highland species in the tropics.'

Title: 'Sustainable urbanization using high speed rail (HSR) in Karnataka, India'
Author: 'Ashish'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885912000583
Abstract: 'AbstractConsidering the present trends of urbanization and motorization in India, there is an urgent need for integration, revitalization and renewal of the smaller towns and cities to make urban areas in India more sustainable. Unless our regional space is reorganized to upgrade development of towns and cities and integrate them with each other and the larger cities, the urbanization process in India will become unsustainable. It is argued that High Speed Rail (HSR) can play a role in achieving this more balanced and sustainable development of towns and cities, opening up opportunities for growth across a wider, inter-connected, region, with the benefit of taking the pressure of the larger cities to absorb additional burgeoning populations. This paper will make the case that in the current Indian context, current patterns of mega-city growth are unsustainable, and that HSR can play an important role in providing opportunities for medium and smaller size cities through their interconnections. It begins by highlighting the role that railways have played in India and other countries, noting that merely economic analysis of their costs and benefits generally underestimated their contributions to development. It then provides an introduction to HSR and its potential impact in general, before applying this to the example of the State of Karnataka in South India.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe daily activity pattern of wild Francois' langurs (Trachypithecus francoisi francisi) was observed in disturbed habitat at Mayanghe National Nature Reserve of Guizhou Province, China, between 1999 and 2000. The behaviors of wild adult Francois' langurs were recorded at a 5-min interval using an instantaneous sampling method. The results indicate that resting, foraging, traveling, huddling, playing and grooming activities account for 35.41%, 31.67%, 14.44%, 9.61%, 8.54% and 0.33%, respectively, in the daily time budget of these adult Francois' langurs during the study period. In comparison with the results in undisturbed habitat, the decreased food availability in disturbed habitat changes the foraging behavior of langurs, and also changes time budgets of other behaviors, such as the increase of the proportion of traveling and the decrease of the proportion of resting. At the same time, the higher frequency of human activity in the disturbed habitat influences the time budget of daily social behavior of the langurs including playing, huddling and grooming. The patterns of activity rhythms of wild adult Francois' langurs in the disturbed habitat show some seasonal differences which are also discussed."

These issues could be removed if renewable energy is used as a primary source of energy in rural areas. It is essential for scientists and researchers to find out the renewable energy resources and effective technologies. Bangladesh is endowed with vast renewable energy resources such as biomass and solar insolation. Besides, hydro and wind power can be considered as potential renewable energy resources. Harnessing these resources appears to be a promising solution for improving the quality of life of rural villagers. The government and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have tried to comprehend and have strived to address the problem of energy. This paper reviews the renewable energy resources and renewable energy technologies (RETs) practicing in Bangladesh in terms of its implementation, research and development activities. The development and trial of systems are mostly funded so far by donor agencies in collaboration with government and NGOs.Biomass energy sources are traditionally used for domestic cooking and in small rural industries. Approximately 60% of total energy demand of the country is supplied by indigenous biomass based fuels. Activities on the development and promotion of biomass technologies have been going on for one decade. Some national and international funds have been available for biogas technology, improved biomass cookers and production of biomass briquettes. At the time, around 25,000 biogas plants exist all over the country in rural areas and educational institutes, etc. More than 0.20 million improve stoves have been installed to save biomass fuel. Over 900 briquetting machines have been operating in the country on commercial basis.The annual solar radiation availability in Bangladesh is as high as 1700\xc2\xa0kWh/m2. Research and demonstration activities carried out for one decade have led to a start of large-scale utilization of PV (solar photovoltaic) by various organizations and by NGOs. More than 61,500 solar PV systems of a total capacity around 3\xc2\xa0MW and 260 hot box cookers have been installed all over the country mainly in off-grid rural, hill tracks and coastal Bangladesh.Kaptai hydroelectric power plant is the only one renewable energy power generation plant of the country that is generating 3.28% of total 3651.20\xc2\xa0MW. The first micro hydropower unit of 10\xc2\xa0kW has been installed in a village of Bandarban through private initiatives. The project is providing electricity to 140 families in the village and to a Buddhist Temple.The annual wind speed at a height of 25\xc2\xa0m at some coastal locations is above 4\xc2\xa0m/s and much higher in the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods. The sites are suitable for power generation, particularly using PV or diesel hybrid technique for winter months.'

Title: 'Harvesting techniques, hemiparasites and fruit production in two non-timber forest tree species in south India'
Author: 'Aditi'

Abstract: 'AbstractIncreasing demands for non-timber forest products and their commercial extractions can result in harvesting methods that maximize short term economic gains with little attention to long term ecological consequences. We assessed the ecological impacts of harvesting techniques used by an indigenous group, the Soligas, on the non-timber forest products they extract from the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, south India. Specifically, we examined patterns of resource availability of two non-timber tree species, Phyllanthus emblica and P. indofischeri, and how the current fruit harvesting techniques influence fruit yields, and susceptibility of trees to infestations by hemiparasitic plants of the Loranthaceae family. We also assessed how hemiparasite infestations affect fruit production and growth rates of Phyllanthus trees. There was considerable variation in fruit production in both species of Phyllanthus from one fruiting season to the next. The Soligas harvest an average of 86% (\xc2\xb117.72%) of the fruit yield on a per tree basis in P. emblica and 94.17% (\xc2\xb16.9%) in the case of P. indofischeri. At the population level, 64.75 and 86.6% of the fruit productivity is harvested in P. emblica and P. indofischeri, respectively. However, not all individuals or populations are harvested. Harvesting techniques used resulted in cutting of 15% of P. indofischeri trees and 5% of P. emblica trees. The current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas reduce fruit production in P. emblica in the following year (R2=0.27,p=0.03). Furthermore, the Soligas selectively harvest fruits from trees that have larger fruit crop sizes in both species. Individual trees that carried a greater load of hemiparasites produced significantly lower fruit yields (P. emblica: r=\xe2\x88\x920.32,p<0.013; P. indofischeri: r=\xe2\x88\x920.73,p<0.001). The presence of hemiparasites significantly affected the growth rates of trees.Current harvesting techniques used by the Soligas have negative impacts on trees of Phyllanthus spp., as do infestations by hemiparasites. Current fruit harvesting strategies and techniques used by the Soligas focus on maximizing the economic returns by adopting methods of extraction such as lopping of branches and cutting of trees. Such practices can ultimately decrease the rates at which the populations grow, thereby making the extraction of Phyllanthus fruits unsustainable. Adopting more sustainable methods of harvesting appears to be one viable solution to the current ecological problem facing the conservation of Phyllanthus trees in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills.'

Title: 'ReviewForest dynamics after selective timber harvesting in Papua New Guinea'
Author: 'Cossey K.'

Abstract: 'AbstractForest dynamics after timber harvesting is a major issue for tropical forest managers and communities. Timber harvesting provides income to communities and governments and resources to industry but it has also been identified as a potential contributor to deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In Papua New Guinea (PNG) harvesting is primarily occurring in accessible primary forests however, the fate of these forests under current harvesting practices is poorly understood.In this study we investigated the impacts of selective harvesting on stand structure, growth and dynamics, recovery and degradation, and species diversity. We also assessed the impacts of forest fire after the 1997\xe2\x80\x9398 El Nino on basal area (BA) growth and mortality rates of natural tropical forests in PNG. For this study we used data from 118 (105 in selectively harvested and 13 in un-harvested forest), one-hectare permanent sample plots distributed across the country and measured for over 15\xc2\xa0years by the PNG Forest Research Institute (PNGFRI). We analysed data from 84 of these plots in harvested forest to examine temporal trends in stand condition following harvesting. Mortality rates were investigated in 10 of the 21 plots in harvested forest that were burned during the 1997\xe2\x80\x9398 El Nino drought with sufficient data for analyses. We tested a model developed in Queensland tropical forests to determine whether or not a critical threshold residual BA existed for the recovery of harvested tropical forests in PNG. Results from a logarithmic regression analysis of the relationship between starting BA (BA at first census) and stand BA increment after selective harvesting showed a positive increase in BA growth (r2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.74, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). However, there was no critical threshold in residual BA that determined whether a harvested forest was likely to degrade or recover BA growth after harvesting. Our analyses suggested that the response to harvesting was variable, with the majority of un-burned plots (75%) showing an increase in BA and remainder a decrease. Average BA of selectively-harvested tropical forests was about 17\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa04.17 (SD). Average annual increment in BA across the 84 un-burned plots was 0.17\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.62 (SD). Thus these forests generally show capacity to recover after selective harvesting even when the residual BA is low. A proportion of the BA increment is made up of non-commercial pioneer species that originate in significant gaps after harvesting. On burned plots, BA is affected by high mortality rates. The fate of these forests will depend on the degree of future harvesting, potential conversion to agriculture and the impact of fire and other disturbances.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Basal area and timber volume are generally increasing after harvesting. \xe2\x96\xba El Nino forest fires affected BA growth and mortality was high on 10% of plots. \xe2\x96\xba Assisted regeneration will assist recovery in sites with declining BA. \xe2\x96\xba Smaller-scale harvesting is required for management of harvested forests in PNG.'

Title: 'Coastal regulation zone rules in coastal panchayats (villages) of Kerala, India vis-\xc3\xa0-vis socio-economic impacts from the recently introduced peoples\xe2\x80\x99 participatory program for local self-governance and sustainable development'

Abstract: 'AbstractCoastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest of Government of India in February 1991 as a part of the Environmental Protection Act of 1986 to protect the coast from eroding and to preserve its natural resources. The initial notification did not distinguish the variability and diversity of various coastal states before enforcing it on the various states and Union Territories. Impact assessments were not carried out to assess its impact on socio-economic life of the coastal population. For the very same reason, it was unnoticed or rather ignored till 1994 when the Supreme Court of India made a land mark judgment on the fate of the coastal aquaculture which by then had established as an economically successful industry in many South Indian States. Coastal aquaculture in its modern form was a prohibited activity within CRZ. Lately, only various stakeholders of the coast realized the real impact of the CRZ rules on their property rights and business. To overcome the initial drawbacks several amendments were made in the regulation to suit regional needs.In 1995, another great transformation took place in the State of Kerala as a part of the re-organization of the local self government institutions into a decentralized three tier system called \xe2\x80\x9cPanchayathi Raj System\xe2\x80\x9d. In 1997, the state government also decided to transfer the power with the required budget outlay to the grass root level panchayats (villages) and municipalities to plan and implement the various projects in their localities with the full participation of the local people by constituting Grama Sabhas (Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Forum). It is called the \xe2\x80\x9cPeoples\xe2\x80\x99 Planning Campaign\xe2\x80\x9d(Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Participatory Programme\xe2\x80\x94PPP for Local Level Self-Governance). The management of all the resources including the local natural resources was largely decentralized to the level of local communities and villages. Integrated, sustainable coastal zone management has become the concern of the local population.The paper assesses the socio-economic impact of the centrally enforced CRZ and the state sponsored PPP on the coastal community in Kerala and suggests measures to improve the system and living standards of the coastal people within the framework of CRZ.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2We report OM source variability in largest monsoonal river of India.\xe2\x80\xa2We examine the impact of natural and man made impact on OM distribution.\xe2\x80\xa2Effect of land use changes on the OM source have been highlighted.\xe2\x80\xa2Effect of reduced monsoon and dams on the OM source change is described.SummaryThe distribution and compositional changes of organic matter (OM) within the Godavari river system is increasingly influenced by reduced monsoon rainfall and an increased number of damming. To track these changes stable isotopes of organic carbon and concentrations of lignin phenols were analyzed in total suspended matter (TSM), sediments, agriculture soils and plants from Godavari basin. The results indicated that the upper tributaries drained heavier carbon (\xce\xb413Corg\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x9220.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.2\xe2\x80\xb0) than the lower tributaries (\xce\xb413Corg\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x9225.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.5\xe2\x80\xb0) owing to the regional vegetation in the upper to lower basins. OM originating from algae near dam impoundments was incorporated into TSM and sediment due to extreme drought condition. The organic carbon (OC) content was higher in TSM and in the sediment of the region after the middle reach dam (Sriram Sagar) than before (2.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.6 vs. 1.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.1% OC and 2.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.3 vs. 0.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2% OC, respectively). The lignin yield (\xce\x9b8) was lower in TSM and in the sediment after the dam impoundment than before (0.37 vs. 1.94\xc2\xa0mg/100\xc2\xa0mg OC and 2.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.1 vs. 5.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.3\xc2\xa0mg/100\xc2\xa0mg OC, respectively) due to an increased contribution of lignin free OC from algae and degraded soil. Less rainfall and dam impoundments enhanced the fraction of labile OM from freshwater algae and an estuarine phytoplankton bloom in the study year. Our study is the first to document lignin fluxes from an Indian monsoonal river (Godavari). The flux of lignin phenols of 7.26\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0109\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921 is much lower than those of most world rivers except the rivers from polar arctic.'

Title: 'ArticlesAn Indian national GEF strategy'

Abstract: 'This paper describes the process of developing a national strategy for preparing, processing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating GEF projects in India. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, requested the paper. A brainstorming meeting was organized to kick off discussions for the preparation of the strategy. Subsequently, several interviews were conducted in New Delhi with officials familiar with preparation and execution of GEF projects. The draft strategy was presented to the government in December 2002. The strategy identified the problems plaguing the current portfolio of GEF projects in India such as lack of impact, a stagnating portfolio with too many incoherent concepts and a lack of interest in GEF Council meetings. The paper proposes measures to address the identified problems and recommends actions to implement the elements of the strategy. Several of the recommendations such as the establishment of an interministerial coordination committee for GEF projects and the decoupling of the office of GEF Council Member from South Asia from the office of the Indian Executive Director of the World Bank have been accepted by the government.'

Title: 'Carbon sequestration versus bioenergy: A case study from South India exploring the relative land-use efficiency of two options for climate change mitigation'
Author: 'J.M.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953409002116
Abstract: 'AbstractThis case study has been carried out as a comparison between two different land-use strategies for climate change mitigation, with possible application within the Clean Development Mechanisms. The benefits of afforestation for carbon sequestration versus for bioenergy production are compared in the context of development planning to meet increasing domestic and agricultural demand for electricity in Hosahalli village, Karnataka, India. One option is to increase the local biomass based electricity generation, requiring an increased biomass plantation area. This option is compared with fossil based electricity generation where the area is instead used for producing wood for non-energy purposes while also sequestering carbon in the soil and standing biomass. The different options have been assessed using the PRO-COMAP model. The ranking of the different options varies depending on the system boundaries and time period. Results indicate that, in the short term (30 years) perspective, the mitigation potential of the long rotation plantation is largest, followed by the short rotation plantation delivering wood for energy. The bioenergy option is however preferred if a long-term view is taken. Short rotation forests delivering wood for short-lived non-energy products have the smallest mitigation potential, unless a large share of the wood products are used for energy purposes (replacing fossil fuels) after having served their initial purpose. If managed in a sustainable manner all of these strategies can contribute to the improvement of the social and environmental situation of the local community.'

Author: 'V.V.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169404003828
Abstract: 'AbstractThe Hybrid approach introduced by the authors for at-site modeling of annual and periodic streamflows in earlier works is extended to simulate multi-site multi-season streamflows. It bears significance in integrated river basin planning studies. This hybrid model involves: (i) partial pre-whitening of standardized multi-season streamflows at each site using a parsimonious linear periodic model; (ii) contemporaneous resampling of the resulting residuals with an appropriate block size, using moving block bootstrap (non-parametric, NP) technique; and (iii) post-blackening the bootstrapped innovation series at each site, by adding the corresponding parametric model component for the site, to obtain generated streamflows at each of the sites. It gains significantly by effectively utilizing the merits of both parametric and NP models. It is able to reproduce various statistics, including the dependence relationships at both spatial and temporal levels without using any normalizing transformations and/or adjustment procedures. The potential of the hybrid model in reproducing a wide variety of statistics including the run characteristics, is demonstrated through an application for multi-site streamflow generation in the Upper Cauvery river basin, Southern India.'

Title: 'Factors influencing community participation in mangroves restoration: A contingent valuation analysis'
Author: 'Kathy'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569108000276
Abstract: "AbstractCommunity participation is viewed as a key to success in ecosystem restoration. This study analyzes factors that influence households' willingness to contribute toward mangrove restoration among three subsistence user groups in west coast of India: fishermen, fisherwomen and rice farmers. Contingent valuation technique is utilized to measure the economic value of perceived benefits of mangroves. Results indicate that each user group would be willing to make substantial contribution of labor and/or cash each year, apparently for different reasons. The perception that mangrove contributes to fish nursery is the strongest reason fishermen take part in restoration. That mangrove serves as an alternative source of income for the whole community influences fisherwomen's decision to participate. Surprisingly, only a minority of rice farmers would be willing to contribute to mangrove restoration, yet at a higher annual median level than the other two groups. Their reason to participate is influenced by the perception that mangroves help control erosion and crop pests. The paper concludes that the restoration manager must carefully consider users' needs and perceived mangrove benefits while selecting mangrove species for restoration in order to enhance community participation."

Abstract: 'AbstractBangladesh has been facing a power crisis for about a decade, mainly because of inadequate power generation capacity compared with demand and the ageing infrastructure of many existing power generation facilities. Only 20% of the total population are connected to grid electricity\xe2\x80\x9425% in urban areas and a mere 10% in rural areas where 80% of the total population resides. Currently, most power plants in Bangladesh (representing 84.5% of the total installed capacity) use natural gas\xe2\x80\x94the main commercial primary energy source, with limited national reserves\xe2\x80\x94as a fuel. Electricity supply to low-load rural and remote areas is characterised by high transmission and distribution costs and transmission losses, and heavily subsidised pricing.Renewable energy sources in Bangladesh, particularly biomass, can play a major role to meet electricity demands in the rural and remote areas of the country. The current study indicates that in 2003, the national total generation and recovery rates of biomass in Bangladesh were 148.983 and 86.276\xc2\xa0Mtonne, respectively. In energy term, the national annual amount of the recoverable biomass is equivalent to 312.613\xc2\xa0TWh. Considering the present national consumption of biomass, total available biomass resources potential for electricity generation vary from 183.865 to 223.794\xc2\xa0TWh. Biomass energy potential in the individual districts of the country has been estimated for the planning small- to medium-scale biomass-to-electricity plants.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWidespread occurrences of coastal dunes are observed in the Cauvery delta region of Tamil Nadu in Vedaranniyam in the south east coast of India. These dunes were studied to establish the chronology of their formation and to understand their evolution using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating in combination with sedimentological studies (quartz grain surface morphology using scanning electron microscope, grain size and heavy mineral analysis). The study shows that on the south-east coast of India widespread periodic dune formation/reactivation has taken place during the late Holocene to very recent times due to a variety of reasons such as climatic variation and land use changes. The sand mobility index shows that the dunes in the area have been largely active during the past century in the southern part in Nagapattinam region and many of the crests were active in the northern Cauvery delta in Cuddalore region. The angularity and fresh appearance of sand in the inland dunes suggest a short distance of sand transport and a source proximal sand deposition was proposed for the dune formation. The study demonstrates the sensitivity of sand dunes on the south east coast of India to varying climatic conditions and changes in regional land use.Highlights\xe2\x96\xba Dune reactivation in the Cauvery delta during late Holocene to recent time. \xe2\x96\xba Rapid accumulation of few meters of dune sand. \xe2\x96\xba Sand mobility is induced by climate variability and land use changes. \xe2\x96\xba Sands derived from the basin lithology and deposited at proximity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractManagement of natural forests might be one option to reduce the high deforestation rate in Ecuador. We therefore evaluated the response of water and nutrient cycles in a natural tropical montane forest to improvement fellings with the aim of favoring economically valuable target trees which will later be harvested with additional ecosystem impacts not considered here.The study was conducted at ca. 1900\xe2\x80\x932200\xc2\xa0m above sea level in the south Ecuadorian Andes on the east-exposed slope of the east cordillera. In June 2004, one of two paired ca. 10-ha large catchments was thinned by felling 10.2% of the initial basal area (dbh\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0cm) on 30% of the catchment. The stems remained in situ. We measured ecosystem fluxes from rainfall via throughfall and stemflow to soil solution (litter leachate, soil solution at 15 and 30\xc2\xa0cm depth) and stream flow between May 2004 and May 2005. After the fellings, soil solutions were extracted from the gaps created by the felled trees and the forest next to the gaps. We determined aboveground water fluxes by direct measurement and soil water fluxes with a budget approach. In the solutions, we measured concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3\xe2\x88\x92-N, total dissolved N, PO43\xe2\x88\x92-P, total dissolved P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and Cl\xe2\x88\x92. Fluxes were calculated as volume-weighted mean (vwm) concentrations times water fluxes. Dry deposition was estimated using Cl\xe2\x88\x92 as inert tracer.The fellings increased concentrations of N, K, Ca, and Mg in the organic layer of the resulting gaps compared with the forest next to the gaps (vwm concentrations of N: 6.4\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 in the forest next to the gap/8.7\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 in the gaps, K: 9.8/11, Mg: 1.8/3.0, Ca: 3.4/5.8). Lower nutrient concentrations and fluxes in the mineral soil of the gaps than in forest next to the gaps suggested that these nutrients were taken up by ground vegetation and target trees. The paired modified and undisturbed catchments had similar water and nutrient budgets. The fellings did not have a significant impact on the water and nutrient budget at the catchment scale.'

Abstract: 'AbstractGeospatial presentation of habitat status has become a key issue for planning conservation. Biodiversity characters of the habitat provide the basis of prioritizing the sites in conservation effort. Since India is identified as one of the 12-mega biodiversity countries in the world, this task is of great significance. In India, biogeographers have long since recognized North-East India as one of the most diverse regions with respect to flora and fauna. Since historic times, human interventions had started influencing the landuse and landcover of this region. Deforestation is mainly attributed to shifting cultivation and commercial logging of timber. This has resulted in fragmentation of the landscape. Landscape fragmentation and degradation have been identified as fundamental reasons for biodiversity loss. The paper uses landscape ecological principles for biodiversity characterization. Satellite remote sensing data have been used for characterization of the landscape and stratification for ground inventory. A geographic information system has been used to spatially model the disturbance regimes and to integrate the ground based nonspatial data with the spatial characters of the landscape. The vegetation types and landuse of Meghalaya have been mapped using Indian remote sensing (IRS) time series data. The various parameters (viz. patch shape, patch size, number of patches, porosity, fragmentation and juxtaposition) have been analyzed on the most recent landcover map to spatially present the disturbance regimes. A spatial model incorporating ground based biodiversity attributes of the landscape elements, landuse change patterns, disturbance regimes of the landscape and terrain complexity have been used to delineate the spatial pattern of biological richness. This has been achieved using the landscape analysis package (LAP) developed at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. Habitat evaluation using ground based data and their spatial organization have been found to provide reliable information on the biodiversity distribution pattern. The present approach for prioritizing the biodiversity rich sites have the advantage of integrating spatial, non-spatial information and horizontal relationships. The information is finally presented in space and time. This approach will facilitate conservation prioritization, systematic inventory and continuous monitoring.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Large heterogeneity prevails in aerosol spatial distribution.\xe2\x80\xa2Basis of selections of tracers for specific source categories has improved.\xe2\x80\xa2Particulate source profile are largely incomparable and sometime confusing.\xe2\x80\xa2Limited use of organic molecular markers and gas-to-particle conversion in SA.\xe2\x80\xa2Finer particulates source profiles are extremely limited.AbstractAirborne particulate chemistry mostly governed by associated sources and apportionment of specific sources is extremely essential to delineate explicit control strategies. The present submission initially deals with the publications (1980s\xe2\x80\x932010s) of Indian origin which report regional heterogeneities of particulate concentrations with reference to associated species. Such meta-analyses clearly indicate the presence of reservoir of both primary and secondary aerosols in different geographical regions. Further, identification of specific signatory molecules for individual source category was also evaluated in terms of their scientific merit and repeatability. Source signatures mostly resemble international profile while, in selected cases lack appropriateness. In India, source apportionment (SA) of airborne particulates was initiated way back in 1985 through factor analysis, however, principal component analysis (PCA) shares a major proportion of applications (34%) followed by enrichment factor (EF, 27%), chemical mass balance (CMB, 15%) and positive matrix factorization (PMF, 9%). Mainstream SA analyses identify earth crust and road dust resuspensions (traced by Al, Ca, Fe, Na and Mg) as a principal source (6\xe2\x80\x9373%) followed by vehicular emissions (traced by Fe, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn, Ba and Zn; 5\xe2\x80\x9365%), industrial emissions (traced by Co, Cr, Zn, V, Ni, Mn, Cd; 0\xe2\x80\x9360%), fuel combustion (traced by K, NH4+, SO4\xe2\x88\x92, As, Te, S, Mn; 4\xe2\x80\x9342%), marine aerosols (traced by Na, Mg, K; 0\xe2\x80\x9315%) and biomass/refuse burning (traced by Cd, V, K, Cr, As, TC, Na, K, NH4+, NO3\xe2\x88\x92, OC; 1\xe2\x80\x9342%). In most of the cases, temporal variations of individual source contribution for a specific geographic region exhibit radical heterogeneity possibly due to unscientific orientation of individual tracers for specific source and well exaggerated by methodological weakness, inappropriate sample size, implications of secondary aerosols and inadequate emission inventories. Conclusively, a number of challenging issues and specific recommendations have been included which need to be considered for a scientific apportionment of particulate sources in different geographical regions of India.Graphical abstractDownload full-size image'

The Kumaun region of Uttaranchal, which has a relatively moderate topography compared to the Garhwal, hill region is productive enough to nearly provide adequate food for its people.'

Abstract: 'The need for generating information on potential woody biomass productivities of tropical forest plantations is highlighted in this paper. Current rates of deforestation and reforestation, and features of plantation forestry in Brazil and India are presented. The plantation forest productivity in India is generally below 8 t/ha/yr while in Brazil it is higher than 10 t/ha/yr. A combination of factors, viz., quality of planting stock, nutrient supplements, and water application, are used to estimate potential and feasible productivities for semi-arid and sub-humid tropical regions. With no improvement in genetic stock and no supplements of water and nutrients, a productivity in the range of 2 to 5 t/ha/yr in semi-arid areas is estimated. With high-quality genetic planting material coupled with supplements of nutrients and water, a productivity in the range of 30 to 35 t/ha/yr could be expected in large-scale plantations.'

Title: 'Landslide hazard analysis for Hong Kong using landslide inventory and GIS'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents a landslide-inventory-based and GIS-based framework for systematic landslide hazard analysis by employing historical landslide data in Hong Kong, coupling with geological, geomorphological, population, climatic, and rainfall data. Based on 1448 landslide data from 1984 to 1998, the diurnal and seasonal distributions of landslides are established and compared with the seasonal rainfall variation. The cumulative fatalities and injuries caused by landslides increase with the cumulative rainfall in Hong Kong, indicating a strong correlation between rainfall and landslide consequences. The average annual fatality and injury rates in Hong Kong caused by landslide are 11.35 and 11.63, respectively. In terms of being hit by a landslide, squatter areas and roads on Hong Kong Island are at the highest risk. A frequency\xe2\x80\x93volume relation for Hong Kong Island was established, and, using this relation, it was estimated that the return period of a 26,000\xc2\xa0m3 landslide (the size of 1995 Shum Wan Road Landslide) is about 3.12 years. A hazard zonation map for Hong Kong Island is established by using historical data. The potential use of GIS technology to incorporate various layers of information is illustrated using Hong Kong Island as an example. Both landslide hazard and risk maps are proposed using raster calculation.'

Title: 'An intelligent front-end for selecting evapotranspiration estimation methods'

Abstract: "AbstractEvapotranspiration (ET) is an important parameter needed by water managers for the design, operation and management of irrigation systems. Since there are many methods to compute ET, based on climatic data, an inexperienced engineer or hydrologist is perplexed with the selection of an appropriate method. In this context, an expert system (ES) would be of great use to aid in selection of a suitable ET estimation method, given the location, data availability and climatic conditions. In this paper an intelligent front-end expert system (ETES), that has been developed to select suitable ET estimation methods under South Indian climatic conditions, is presented. Ten meteorological stations located in different climatic regions and thirteen ET estimation methods have been considered in this ES. Like a human consultant, the system asks the user for detailed information regarding the details of the project site such as location, season, climatic zone, and data availability. It then makes a recommendation based on this information and the system's own knowledge of such a situation. Along with the recommended method, ETES will also suggest suitable correction factors for converting the resulting ET values to those of methods that result in accurate estimation. The developed ES would be of much potential use in irrigation management in developing countries like India."

Abstract: "AbstractSustainable agriculture is vital in today's world as it offers the potential to meet our agricultural needs, something that conventional agriculture fails to do. This type of agriculture uses a special farming technique wherein the environmental resources can be fully utilized and at the same time ensuring that no harm was done to it. Thus the technique is environment friendly and ensures safe and healthy agricultural products. Microbial populations are instrumental to fundamental processes that drive stability and productivity of agro-ecosystems. Several investigations addressed at improving understanding of the diversity, dynamics and importance of soil microbial communities and their beneficial and co-operative roles in agricultural productivity.

Abstract: "Sustainable development is an equitable, empowering, environmentally sound, economically viable process of growth. Energy is the key indicator of sustainable development. About 74% of the population of India live in rural areas. 80% of their energy needs are derived from biomass. About 92% of this energy is consumed in cooking activity. Women play a major role in biofuel management. Rural women's perspective in sustainable development is therefore critical.Declining biofuel resources, poor quality of the available biofuels and inefficient devices have pushed women into greater hardships. This paper examines the role of rural women in biomass management. The energy resources that rural women use, the strategy that the government and other organisations have adopted to alleviate rural energy problems and how these strategies have benefited women and improved their quality of life, the importance of incorporating the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cgender and development\xe2\x80\x9d in alternative energy strategies to achieve the objectives of sustainable development are discussed in this paper."

Title: 'Human impacts to mountain streams'
Author: 'Ellen'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X06002522
Abstract: 'AbstractMountain streams are here defined as channel networks within mountainous regions of the world. This definition encompasses tremendous diversity of physical and biological conditions, as well as history of land use. Human effects on mountain streams may result from activities undertaken within the stream channel that directly alter channel geometry, the dynamics of water and sediment movement, contaminants in the stream, or aquatic and riparian communities. Examples include channelization, construction of grade-control structures or check dams, removal of beavers, and placer mining. Human effects can also result from activities within the watershed that indirectly affect streams by altering the movement of water, sediment, and contaminants into the channel. Deforestation, cropping, grazing, land drainage, and urbanization are among the land uses that indirectly alter stream processes. An overview of the relative intensity of human impacts to mountain streams is provided by a table summarizing human effects on each of the major mountainous regions with respect to five categories: flow regulation, biotic integrity, water pollution, channel alteration, and land use. This table indicates that very few mountains have streams not at least moderately affected by land use. The least affected mountainous regions are those at very high or very low latitudes, although our scientific ignorance of conditions in low-latitude mountains in particular means that streams in these mountains might be more altered than is widely recognized. Four case studies from northern Sweden (arctic region), Colorado Front Range (semiarid temperate region), Swiss Alps (humid temperate region), and Papua New Guinea (humid tropics) are also used to explore in detail the history and effects on rivers of human activities in mountainous regions. The overview and case studies indicate that mountain streams must be managed with particular attention to upstream/downstream connections, hillslope/channel connections, process domains, physical and ecological roles of disturbance, and stream resilience.'

Abstract: 'AbstractComplementarity between conservation and productivity objectives makes watershed development attractive in semi-arid areas. A potential trade-off with poverty alleviation arises however because watershed development may benefit landholders while harming landless people, particularly herders and women. India has a history of highly innovative watershed projects in which downstream landholders share benefits by compensating landless people upstream for providing an environmental service. Most current projects, however, take alternative measures that ignore the issue of environmental services. Evidence from 70 villages in Maharashtra suggests the presence of poverty alleviation trade-offs, highlighting the potential value of more explicitly addressing compensation for environmental services.'

Title: 'Rapid assessment of biological richness in a part of Eastern Himalaya: an integrated three-tier approach'
Author: 'M.D.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112704008187
Abstract: "AbstractBiodiversity conservation necessitates not only preservation of single or multiple species but also the habitat as a whole along with its environment. Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized software, Bio_CAP. Higher biological richness was assigned to the habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated \xe2\x80\x98three-tier modeling approach\xe2\x80\x99 of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid assessment of biological richness.Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to ecological habitats), with 89% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e., proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species diversity (Shannon's index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation. Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon's index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ."

Title: 'ReviewThe Indian perspective of utilizing fly ash in phytoremediation, phytomanagement and biomass production'
Author: 'Vimal Chandra'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479709001546
Abstract: "AbstractCoal-based power generation is a principal source of electricity in India and many other countries. About 15\xe2\x80\x9330% of the total amount of residue generated during coal combustion is fly ash (FA). FA is generally alkaline in nature and contains many toxic metals like Cr, Pb, Hg, As and Cd along with many essential elements like S, B, Ca, Na, Fe, Zn, Mn and P. Dumped FA contaminates the biosphere by mobilization of its fine particles and hazardous metals. Despite the negative environmental impact of FA, coal continues to be a major source of power production in India and therefore FA disposal is a major environmental issue. To overcome this problem, FA dumping sites have been started as a potential resource for biomass production of tree species. Phytoremediation is a strategy that uses plants to degrade, stabilize, and remove contaminants from soils, water and waste FA. Phytomanagement of FA is based on the plants' root systems, high biomass, woody nature, native nature, and resistance to pH, salinity, and toxic metals. Recently Indian researchers mostly from the National Botanical Research Institute have been working on phytoremediation and revegetation of FA dykes, inoculation of bacterial strains for reducing FA stress and biomass production from FA dykes. Many international researchers have worked on reclamation, revegetation and utilization of FA. FA utilization saves resources, mainly land (topsoil), water, coal, limestone and chemical fertilizer. Safe utilization of FA is a major concern around the world and regulatory bodies are enforcing stringent rules for the proper management of FA. This article summarizes various viable avenues in India for FA utilization and environmental management."

Title: 'Surge-tectonic evolution of southeastern Asia: a geohydrodynamics approach'
Author: 'Arthur A.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0743954795000283
Abstract: "AbstractThe repeated need for ad hoc modifications in plate-tectonic models to explain the evolution of southeastern Asia reveals their inability to fully explain the complex features and dynamics of this region. As one example, the hypothesis does not provide a mechanism to explain the 180\xc2\xb0 turns and twists along the strike of several foldbelts and island arcs in the region (e.g. Banda arc). Convection-cell configuration renders such 180\xc2\xb0 contortions and Rayleigh-B\xc3\xa9nard-type convection impossible. However, during the last 10 years, new data bearing on the convection-cell problem have become available in the form of seismotomographic images of the earth's interior. These images show that (i) mantle diapirs as proposed by traditional plate-tectonic models do not exist; (ii) there is no discernible pattern of upper or lower mantle convection, and thus no longer an adequate mechanism to move plates; and (iii) the lithosphere above a depth of about 80 km is permeated by an interconnected network of low-velocity channels.Seismic-reflection studies of the low-velocity channels discovered on the seismotomographic images reveal that these channels have walls with a 7.1\xe2\x80\x937.8 km s\xe2\x88\x921 P-wave velocity. Commonly, the interiors of the channels are acoustically transparent, with much slower P-wave velocities, in places as low as 5.4 km s\xe2\x88\x921. The author and co-workers have interpreted the low velocities as evidence for the presence of partial melt in the channels, and they postulated that this melt moves preferentially eastward as a result of the earth's rotation. They named these channels \xe2\x80\x9csurge channels\xe2\x80\x9d and their new hypothesis for earth dynamics \xe2\x80\x9csurge tectonics\xe2\x80\x9d.Surge channels underlie every type of tectonic belt, which includes mid-ocean ridges, aseismic ridges, continental rifts, strike-slip fracture zones, and foldbelts. In southeastern Asia, surge channels\xe2\x80\x94mainly foldbelts\xe2\x80\x94lie between all platform and cratonic massifs. These massifs, platforms, and tectonics belts\xe2\x80\x94the surge channels\xe2\x80\x94form an anastomosing E-W pattern southern Asiatic Russia, Mongolia, western China, the Qinghai-Tibetan region, and northern India and Pakistan. Such an anastomosing pattern indicates that flow is an active process in the surge channels.Surface studies of phenomena that might be associated with the surge channels soon revealed that all active channels are characterized by higher-than-normal heat flow (> 55 mW m\xe2\x88\x922, thermal springs and elevated ground-water temperatures, volvanic phenomena, bands of microearthquakes, and linear belts of faults, fractures, and fissures. The latter are especially visible on satellite images. The bands of high heat flow, thermal springs, microearthquakes, and faults-fractures-fissures almost exactly coincide. The fault-fracture-fissure systems are interpreted to be streamlines caused by flow in the surge channels\xe2\x80\x94a consequence of Stokes's Law (an expression of Newton's Second Law of Motion)-and show that Poiseuille flow must dominate in the channels. Hence, the mechanism producing the belts of linear faults-fractures-fissures is viscous drag, produced by fluid motions.The eastward flow of the magma in the channels is demonstrated clearly in the tectonic patterns of southeastern Asia. In the northern part of the region studied, the E-W striking anastomosing surge channels (tectonic belts) splay northeastward into the coastal regions of Russia. In the south, they splay southward and southeastward through the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. The open horsetail structures thus created prove that flow is W-E. The presence of the two splay directions, NE and S-SE, indicates in addition that a barrier to eastward flow must lie directly east of Asia. In this author's opinion, this barrier is the existing Benioff zone, because the same NE and S-SE splay patterns are present on each of the paleotectonic maps that have been prepared for nine time intervals from the beginning of Sinian (latest Proterozoic) time to the present.The presence of the W-E flow patterns through 850 Ma of geological time, patterns that remain essentially unchanged, means simply that tectonic explanations of Asian geology need revision. The patterns that have been mapped indicate that W-E flow across Asia has persisted essentially unchanged for 850 Ma. Surge tectonics is the only hypothesis yet proposed that explains these patterns and their persistence."

Title: 'ReviewIndigenous exploitation and management of tropical forest resources: an evolutionary continuum in forest-people interactions'
Author: 'K.F.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880996011243
Abstract: 'AbstractSince the early 1980s several new approaches towards forest management, which include active participation of local communities, have been tried out in many tropical regions. As a result of these efforts recognition has increased about the various ways in which many local communities are already actively managing their forest resources. The planning of development interventions to stimulate more efficient community involvement in forest management can often be based on such indigenous forest management systems. This paper aims to improve the understanding about the diversity and dynamics of indigenous forest management. The analysis consists of three parts. First an overview of the various types of indigenous forest management and their dynamics is presented. Subsequently, the basic principles of forest management are discussed. Forest management is characterized as involving a set of both technical activities and social arrangements for the protection and utilization of forest resources and the distribution of forest products. Three major categories of forest management practices are identified, e.g. controlled utilization of forest products, protection and maintenance of forest stands, and purposeful regeneration. The practices in the first category are both socially and biologically oriented, whereas the activities of the last two categories are biologically oriented. These principles are then used to develop a classification model of the various evolutionary phases in forest management. Along the lines of a similar model developed for exploitation of agricultural crops, various stages of forest management are distinguished along a gradient of increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest. This gradient represents a continuum of forest-people interactions; it illustrates how the various manifestations of indigenous forest management may be arranged along a nature-culture continuum.'

Title: 'Tropical forest recovery: legacies of human impact and natural disturbances'
Author: 'Robin L.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1433831904700670
Abstract: "AbstractLand-use history interacts with natural forces to influence the severity of disturbance events and the rate and nature of recovery processes in tropical forests. Although we are far from an integrated view of forest recovery processes, some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays a critical role in local recovery processes. Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today's tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests."

Title: 'Domestic energy consumption patterns in Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State, India'
Author: 'T.V.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019689049900151X
Abstract: 'AbstractEnergy planning of any region should be based on existing levels of energy consumption. Sectorwise disaggregated information of energy usage is developed for the Uttara Kannada District to assist in the regional energy planning exercise. This paper provides comparative analyses of village level domestic energy consumption patterns across coastal, interior, hilly and plain zones considering regional and seasonal variations. Cooking, water heating and space heating are the major end use activities. The results, based on eighteen months of field research in five taluks of Uttara Kannada, reveal that the average energy consumption norm does vary significantly for cooking and water heating in various seasons across the zones. Among the five taluks, 90 villages (out of 119) and all divisions of Kumta town in the Kumta taluk and 190\xe2\x80\x93220 randomly selected households in selected villages of Sirsi, Mundgod, Siddapur and Ankola were studied. A survey of 1304 households from 90 villages in the Kumta taluk shows that most of them still use traditional stoves for cooking (97.92%) and water heating (98.3%). Average consumption (kg/person/day) for cooking ranges from 2.01\xc2\xb11.49 (coastal) to 2.32\xc2\xb12.09 (hilly). Seasonwise cooking fuel wood requirement for coast and hilly zones, ranges from 1.98 and 2.22 (summer) to 2.11 and 2.51 (monsoon), respectively, while for water heating (for bath and washing), it ranges from 1.17\xc2\xb10.02 (coast) to 1.63\xc2\xb10.05 (hilly). Seasonal variation is evident from the range 1.12 and 1.53 (summer) to 1.22 and 1.73 (monsoon) for coastal and hilly zones, respectively. Analysis of other sources of energy for domestic purposes shows that kerosene is used for cooking and lighting in the coast. Kerosene consumption (l/person/month) for cooking ranges from 0.05 (hilly) to 0.34 (coast) and for lighting ranges from 0.75 (coast) to 0.99 (hilly). Availability of bioresources in hilly zone is the main reason for less consumption of kerosene for cooking. In the hilly zone, electrification of all households has not been possible, as they are scattered. Because of the erratic supply during all seasons (especially monsoon), electrified households also depend on kerosene for lighting. Based on fuel consumption norms (regionwise, seasonwise and end usewise), (a) the total fuel wood required (cooking, water heating, space heating, jaggery making and parboiling) works out to 1.668,698.23 tonnes/year, (b) the electricity demand, excluding irrigation, is about 32.65 million kWh/year and (c) the kerosene demand for cooking and water heating is about 15.86 million litres per year.'

Abstract: 'AbstractOrchids (Orchidaceae) are one of the most diverse plant groups on the planet with over 25,000 species. For over a century, scientists and horticulturalists have been fascinated by their complex floral morphology, pollinator specificity and multiple ethnobotanical uses, including as food, flavourings, medicines, ornaments, and perfumes. These important traits have stimulated world-wide collection of orchid species, often for the commercial production of hybrids and leading to frequent overexploitation. Increasing human activities and global environmental changes are also accelerating the threat of orchid extinction in their natural habitats. In order to improve gene conservation strategies for these unique species, innovative developments of cryopreservation methodologies are urgently needed based on an appreciation of low temperature (cryo) stress tolerance, the stimulation of recovery growth of plant tissues in vitro and on the \xe2\x80\x98omics\xe2\x80\x99 characterization of the targeted cell system (biotechnology). The successful development and application of such cryobiotechnology now extends to nearly 100 species and commercial hybrids of orchids, underpinning future breeding and species conservation programmes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the progress in cryobanking of a range of orchid tissues, including seeds, pollen, protocorms, protocorm-like bodies, apices excised from in vitro plants, cell suspensions, rhizomes and orchid fungal symbionts. We also highlight future research needs.'

Title: 'Geological and geotechnical engineering aspects of low-cost roads in mountainous terrain'
Author: 'P.G.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe paper is concerned with design and construction of mountain roads in areas of high relief and steep mountain slopes, where the principal soil types are transported rather than residual and the landscape is shaped mainly by active erosion processes. In order to simplify the wide range of ground conditions encountered, the geology and geomorphology of typical mountain terrain are described and related to a five zone model. Geotechnical features within each zone are then considered so that the application of various investigation and construction techniques can be appreciated. The paper is primarily concerned with low-cost but well-trafficked primary roads where closure time due to slope failures or lack of maintenance are intended to be minimal. Village feeder roads and steep mountain haul roads, for example those used in forestry, are not the prime concern of the paper.Three aspects which distinguish mountain roads from typical lowland roads are the difficult ground access with numerous slope instability problems, the greater use of very local construction materials and the greater need for off-site drainage and erosion protection measures. In remote rugged terrain access for wheeled traffic may not exist. This severely curtails the use of conventional site investigation techniques, such as drilling, and means that greater emphasis is placed on remote sensing and on the surface assessment of ground conditions. Several relatively new low-cost techniques applicable to the investigation of mountain regions are described. A rational approach to alignment selection is developed which stresses the importance of stable ascent corridors, and practical guidelines are offered on the selection of the road cross-section and on the variety of techniques available to stabilise the cross-section chosen. The use of local construction materials is dictated largely on economic grounds and may place heavy constraints on construction standards and structural design. The use of gabion structures is a major construction technique examined in the paper. Drainage and erosion protection methods are important in areas of high relief and erosion potential and a range of design approaches are described. The bulk of stabilisation and control works described can only be attempted by labour'
