Abstract: "Contamination-free, simple, cheap and efficient protocol for long term in vitro conservation of Ipsea malabarica (Reichb. f.) J.D. Hook, `the Malabar Daffodil Orchid', an endemic and endangered orchid of the Western Ghats of Kerala at the whole plant level was achieved. Strategies such as reduction in salt strength and medium with or without hormone/sugar were adopted for conservation in vitro. Culture vessel type significantly influenced the period of storage. Jam bottles were superior to test tubes for conservation. Half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 3% sugar and 1.5 mg l\xe2\x88\x921 kinetin in jam bottles facilitated storage of shoots up to 14 months without subculture which developed 25 shoots. Elimination of sugar from the above medium increased the storage period to 20 months. The shoots on this medium exhibited reduced growth and developed less than 12 shoots. Half-strength growth regulator free medium with sugar exhibited very slow growth and developed less than five shoots. This medium facilitated storage up to 20 months. Half-strength MS growth regulator and sugar free (photoautotrophic) medium was best for in vitro conservation and the storage period on this medium was 27 months. On this medium, the shoots grew very slowly and rarely developed another shoot. The culture was also free of contamination. Since 1997, about 100 of this threatened orchid have been maintaining in vitro at whole plant level."

Abstract: 'Earth Observation with large suite of sensors and with capabilities to address natural resources at multiple scales has proven to be a critical resource in setting conservation priorities of a region. The role of earth observation data was recognized towards achieving international biodiversity targets by 2020. Ecosystem irreplaceability and ecosystem vulnerability are two concepts key to understanding and preparing conservation priority maps. This study presents spatial conservation prioritization analysis for forests of \xe2\x80\x98Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot\xe2\x80\x99. Earth observation data products have been used for prioritization of areas of irreplaceability and vulnerability that are significant for conservation planning. The spatial surrogates of biodiversity in terms of very dense forest, biological richness, intactness and rarity of habitat are analyzed for evaluation of ecosystem irreplaceability. Fragmentation, forest fires, plant invasion and disturbance index are surrogates included for spatial analysis of ecosystem vulnerability. Vegetation type wise analysis indicates dry deciduous forests are under high vulnerability, followed by moist deciduous forests. The high concentration of irreplaceability is observed in Shola followed by wet evergreen forests and semi-evergreen forests. Spatial prioritization approach has identified about 18% of the forest area as irreplaceable which represents overlapped area of very dense forest, shola, intact forest and high biological richness. We observed that the overlap of forest areas of irreplaceability with vulnerability in southern Western Ghats, which needs high priority of conservation. This study is the first of its kind wherein multi-source earth observation data has been analysed to examine the quantitative criteria at regional level in Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'In fast-changing tropical landscapes, effective strategies for conservation must incorporate information on ecosystems and species distribution with that on landscape change. A possible methodology for conservation prioritization is developed and illustrated using a 27.5 km2 tropical landscape in the Western Ghats hill chain of southern India. Vegetation types or ecosystems within the landscape are ranked based on the ecosystem services they might provide: number of endemic species harbored, species richness, contribution to carbon uptake, economic value of produce per ha and contribution to soil renewal. For a vegetation type, the weighted average of these ranks indicates its net conservation value. Weights thus provide a means of ascribing differential importance to an ecosystem service. Information on landscape change is also summarized by a matrix depicting the likelihood of transformations between vegetation types present in the landscape, projected 5 years into the future. For each transformation between two vegetation types, information on ecosystem service and dynamics is then integrated. Implications from the perspective of conservation are assessed as the product of transformation probability and the resultant gain/loss in conservation value. Strongly positive transformations are likely to result in positive impacts on conservation value, and occur without any additional conservation effort. Strongly negative transformations are likely to occur and have a strong negative impact on conservation value. Maximum conservation effort may be directed at halting or reversing these. This study thus describes a method for conservation prioritization, which integrates information on ecosystem function and services with ecosystem dynamics.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the distribution and abundance of 4 species of diurnal primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque, Nilgiri langur and Hanuman langur, in 2 areas\xe2\x80\x94Brahmagiri-Makut and Sirsi-Honnavara\xe2\x80\x94in rain forests of the Western Ghats in the state of Karnataka, India. The Nilgiri langurs in Brahmagiri-Makut and the lion-tailed macaques in Sirsi-Honnavara are the northernmost populations of the 2 species in the Western Ghats. The 2 regions represent changes in ecological zones in the Western Ghats. In Brahmagiri-Makut, Hanuman langurs and bonnet macaques occupy lower elevations whereas Nilgiri langurs live in relatively higher altitudes. Only one group of lion-tailed macaques was in Brahmagiri-Makut. In the forests of Sirsi-Honnavara, 3 species of primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque and Hanuman langur were in larger numbers throughout the forest. A self-sustainable single population of 32 groups of lion-tailed macaques occurred in Sirsi-Honnavara. Few subspecies of Hanuman langurs exist in the study regions. Due to local hunting practices, the relative abundance of primates in Brahmagiri-Makut is lower than that in Sirsi-Honnavara.'

Abstract: 'Hill forts of Northern Western Ghats offer an interesting mix of man-made and natural habitats and as a result shelter a great diversity of endemic and threatened plants. Strict protection of certain areas and selective interference for strategic reasons on hill forts are responsible for maintenance of large protected populations of local endemic species. This has also created special patterns of plant distribution. In recent years, many novelties have been described from forts. Though hill forts have gained importance from the historical and archeological point of view, they are seldom considered as biodiversity conservatories. We suggest here that while prioritizing conservation areas in Northern Western Ghats, hill forts should be given a status of local biodiversity hotspots and conservation should be provided to all microhabitats that are natural as well as man-made. This will assure protection of endemic and threatened species of Western Ghats as well as local endemics of Northern Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'This study highlights spatial characterization of evergreen forests of the Western Ghats \xe2\x80\x93 an ecological hotspot in Tamil Nadu, India \xe2\x80\x93 using remote sensing and GIS-based analysis in conjunction with ground-based phytosociological data. The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only 15\xe2\x80\x9328% of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.'

Abstract: 'Seventy one fish species belonging to 27 families and 50 genera were collected from various sampling sites spread along the upstream and downstream parts of the Chalakudy river, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, South India. Cyprinids were the most dominant group represented by 24 species belonging to 13 genera, followed by the catfishes of the family Bagridae (7 species from 2 genera) and loaches belonging to the family Balitoridae (5 species from 5 genera). Of the 71 species, 4 belong to the \xe2\x80\x98critically endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (CR) and 16 to the \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (EN) category. 3 of the critically endangered species are strictly endemic to the Chalakudy river system. We also collected 5 exotic species several of them categorized as potential pest. Fish species richness (FSR) showed a direct relationship with increasing stream order with maximum values observed in the downstream/low elevation regions. Considerable differences were observed in the FSR between different microhabitats with maximum values observed in bed rock and pool riffle and the lowest in regimes followed by step pools. Diversity and species richness decreased with increasing altitude and higher diversity and species richness were observed in sampling sites located between 0\xe2\x80\x93200\xc2\xa0m above sea level. A definite temporal partitioning was also observed with regard to FSR with higher richness during the day time and the lowest observed at dawn. Indiscriminate collection of endemic and threatened ornamental fish species for export, exploitation of endangered food fishes by forest-dwelling communities and local fisher folk, pollution, loss of riparian cover, damming and exotic species threaten the rich ichthyofaunal diversity of Chalakudy River. An urgent need exists for studying the life history traits and demography of the most important endemic and threatened fishes, as lack of information on these aspects have significantly affected conservation efforts. The implementation of strong management strategies like fixing total allowable catch (TAC), and the use of quotas are needed to reduce the overall collection pressure with regard to the trade in native ornamental species from the river.'

Abstract: 'In order to understand the vegetative and reproductive phenological behaviour of Syzygium caryophyllatum, the knowledge of the factor influencing leaf flushing, maturation, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting of this tree species is required. The authors used field observations collected over 3\xc2\xa0years (2012\xe2\x80\x932015) at Neeliyarkottam sacred grove, Kannur district, Western Ghats of Kerala, India, to characterize the relationship between phenological pattern and biotic and abiotic (climatic) factors. The relationship between phenological pattern of the selected species and abiotic variables such as precipitation and temperature exhibited significant variation among the species. Flowering begins from second week of March to till May with a peak in April followed by the fruiting. Hand pollination tests indicated that most of the fruits were developed through xenogamous pollination. The breeding test results indicated S. caryophyllatum is self-incompatible and out-crossing is fertile. The foraging activities of some common pollinators on S. caryophyllatum flowers were also studied. The main flower visitors and foragers include honey bees, different varieties of butterflies, wasps, carpenter bees, small flies, bugs and ants. The flowering and fruiting exclusively occur in the dry season and are followed by germination and establishment of seedlings during the subsequent rainy season. The authors conclude that the investigations on the reproductive phenology, floral biology, breeding systems and pollinator visitation are important due to population survival of the species and its evolutionary success.'

Abstract: ' Decalepis arayalpathra, a critically endangered plant species, has a restricted and fragmented population in Southern Western Ghats, India. This study is a first attempt to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure in the nine wild populations of D. arayalpathra based on molecular pattern realized through the marker assays. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Nei\xe2\x80\x99s unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA)-based hierarchical clustering of both the marker assays suggest strong genetic clustering between the individuals corresponding to their geographical ranges. Mantel test also corroborates a close genetic proximity between genetic and geographic data (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.389). Population genetic analysis revealed low levels of gene flow [inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.289 and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.847] between the populations, in line with high genetic differentiation (Gst\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.531 with ISSR and 0.440 with RAPD), which was also supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), that 54\xc2\xa0% (ISSR) and 64\xc2\xa0% (RAPD) total variation resided within populations. Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis detected three genetic clusters showing the high degree of admixture within population. Based on the findings, such as inbreeding depression and the loss of genetic diversity, suggestions for conservation strategies are provided to preserve the genetic resources of this endangered species.'

Abstract: 'Spatially explicit approach is essential to prioritise the ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. In the present study, the conservation status of 20 protected areas of the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, was analysed based on long-term changes in forests (1975\xe2\x80\x931985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005\xe2\x80\x932013), landscape level changes in fragmentation and forest fires (2005\xe2\x80\x932015). This study has shown that a significant forest loss occurred in protected areas before declaration. Idukki is one of the major protected areas which showed a drastic reduction (18.83%) in its forest cover. During 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, Periyar tiger reserve had lost 24.19\xc2\xa0km2 core 3 forest area followed by Peppara (18.54\xc2\xa0km2), Parambikulam (17.93\xc2\xa0km2), Chimmony (17.71\xc2\xa0km2), Peechi-Vazhani (12.31\xc2\xa0km2) and Neyyar (11.67\xc2\xa0km2). An area of 71.33\xc2\xa0km2 of the protected area was affected by fires in 2014. Overall protected area-wise decadal analysis indicates Periyar has the highest number of fire incidences followed by Wayanad, Kurinjimala, Silent Valley and Eravikulam. Disturbances in the form of fires and fragmentation still exist and may have significant conservation threat to flora and fauna. Among protected areas, many are having a probability to go under threat or dynamic stage. Chinnar, Thattekkad and Kurinjimala sanctuaries are representing high levels of vulnerability, or they are near to decline stage. Habitat level monitoring of the anthropogenic disturbances can be efficiently useful for the strategic conservation planning. The present study has provided geospatial database on spatial patterns of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in protected areas of Kerala. Conservation prioritization approach based on these parameters will be useful for the strategic planning in the state of Kerala.'

Abstract: 'This study documents the distribution patterns, endemism and uniqueness (species richness) of fishes in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers of Western Ghats, India. We recorded 77 species represented by 7 orders, 16 families and 44 genera, of which 36 species are endemic to Western Ghats, 12 species endemic to India and 26 species endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. Based on our analysis on the distribution patterns, the Tunga River is richer in diversity and higher in endemism than the Bhadra. We calculated the similarity of the species composition among sites within these two rivers using the Jacquard index. The similarity index between the sampling sites of these rivers revealed that the similarity decreases with increasing distance between the sampling sites. Of the 77 fish species we collected, 8 species (11.1%) are in the Critical category, 10 species (13.8%) are in the High Risk category, 36 species (50%) are in the Moderate category and the remaining 18 species (25%) are at lower risk. The threat status of fishes found in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers strongly suggests the need for effective conservation measures to conserve the fish species richness of these rivers.'

Abstract: 'Climate change, alien species, and use of land for intensive farming and development are causing severe threat to the plant genetic diversity worldwide. Hence, conservation of biodiversity is considered fundamental and also provides the livelihoods to millions of people worldwide. Medicinal plants play a key role in the treatment of a number of diseases, and they are only the source of medicine for majority of people in the developing world. The tropical regions of the world supply the bulk of current global demand for \xe2\x80\x9cnatural medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d albeit with increasing threat to populations in the world and its genetic diversity. India is a major center of origin and diversity of crop and medicinal plants. India poses out 20,000 species of higher plants, one third of it being endemic and 500 species are categorized to have medicinal value. The Western Ghats is one of the major repositories of medicinal plants. It harbors around 4,000 species of higher plants of which 450 species are threatened. Currently, the number of species added to the red list category in this region is increasing, and the valuable genetic resources are being lost at a rapid rate. Demand for medicinal plants is increasing, and this leads to unscrupulous collection from the wild and adulteration of supplies. Providing high-quality planting material for sustainable use and thereby saving the genetic diversity of plants in the wild is important. During the last 25\xc2\xa0years of intensive research, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute has developed in vitro protocol for rapid regeneration and establishment of about 40 medicinally important rare and threatened plants of Western Ghats. In situ conservation alone would not be effective in safeguarding these important species. Thus, utilizing the biotechnoligical approach to complement ex situ conservation program is becoming vital. Propagating biotechnology tools in plant conservation program is a prerequisite to succeed in sustainable use and to complement the existing ex situ measures. In addition to propagation, storage of these valuable genetic resources is equally important. In vitro slow growth of 35 species and cryopreservation using embryo/meristem/seed in 20 different species of rare medicinal plants of this region is accomplished. Plants developed in vitro of ten medicinal plants, which have restricted distribution, were reintroduced in the natural habitat as well.'

Abstract: 'The status of the endemic and endangered lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) has not been properly assessed in several regions of the Western Ghats of southern India. We conducted a study in Parambikulam Forest Reserve in the state of Kerala to determine the distribution, demography, and status of lion-tailed macaques. We laid 5km2 grid cells on the map of the study area (644km2) and made four replicated walks in each grid cell using GPS. We gathered data on lion-tailed macaque group locations, demography, and site covariates including trail length, duration of walk, proportion of evergreen forest, height of tallest trees, and human disturbance index. We also performed occupancy modeling using PRESENCE ver. 3.0. We estimated a minimum of 17 groups of macaques in these hills. Low detection and occupancy probabilities indicated a low density of lion-tailed macaques in the study area. Height of the tallest trees correlated positively whereas human disturbance and proportion of evergreen forest correlated negatively with occupancy in grid cells. We also used data from earlier studies carried out in the surrounding Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Nelliyampathy Hills to discuss the conservation status in the large Anamalai Hills Landscape. This landscape harbors an estimated population of 1108 individuals of lion-tailed macaques, which is about one third of the entire estimated wild population of this species. A conservation plan for this landscape could be used as a model for conservation in other regions of the Western Ghats.'

Abstract: ' Coelogyne nervosa is an epiphytic orchid endemic to Western Ghats, South India. The mature seeds of C. nervosa were cultured on \xc2\xbd MS (Murashige and Skoog), MS, Kn (Knudson) and VW (Vacin and Went) media to evaluate the seed germination response. Of the four basal media used, MS medium supported maximum seed germination. Further experiments to enhance seed germination were done on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations (10, 20, 30 and 40\xc2\xa0%) of coconut water (CW). Thirty percent CW gave the highest response in terms of percent seed germination (96), fresh weight (7.2\xc2\xa0mg/seedling) and protocorm length (15.2\xc2\xa0mm). Since CW containing medium did not support further seedling growth, each seedling was isolated and cultured on MS medium supplemented with either BA (6-benzylaminopurine) or Kin (kinetin) alone (1.0\xe2\x80\x934.0\xc2\xa0mg/l each) or in combination with NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid; 0.2\xe2\x80\x931.0\xc2\xa0mg/l). Maximum growth was observed on MS medium supplemented with BA (3.0\xc2\xa0mg/l) and NAA (0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l). On this medium, the seedlings reached an average length of 3.6\xc2\xa0cm with 2.8 well expanded green leaves per seedling. Similarly optimum, healthy, white root induction (3.3 roots/seedlings) was also observed on the same medium. The rooted seedlings were successfully transplanted to pots with 91\xc2\xa0% success. The 2-year-old tissue culture derived plants produced normal flowers and fruits.'

Abstract: 'Understanding how different audience groups perceive wildlife is crucial for the promotion of biodiversity conservation, especially given the key role of flagship species in conservation campaigns. Although the heterogeneity in preferences reinforces the need for campaigns tailored to specific target audiences, many conservation education and awareness campaigns still claim to target the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral public\xe2\x80\x9d. Audiences can be segmented according to social, economic, and cultural criteria across which species perceptions are known to vary. Different studies have investigated the preferences of different groups towards certain wildlife species, but these are largely confined to a single conservation stakeholder group, such as tourists, local communities, or potential donors in western countries. In this study, we seek to determine from a multi-stakeholder perspective, audience characteristics that influence perceptions towards wildlife at Valparai, a fragmented plateau in the Western Ghats region of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka Hotspot. We found that stakeholder group membership was the most important characteristic followed by gender. While some characteristics had a wide-scale effect others were restricted to a few species. Our results emphasize the need to design conservation campaigns with specific audiences in mind, instead of the very often referred to \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral public\xe2\x80\x9d.'

Abstract: 'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the \xe2\x80\x98ecological units\xe2\x80\x99 with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR (1\xe2\x80\x934) through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.'

Abstract: 'As large nature reserves occupy only a fraction of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s land surface, conservation biologists are critically examining the role of private lands, habitat fragments, and plantations for conservation. This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.'

Abstract: 'Conservation initiatives are designed to address threats to forests and biodiversity, often through partnerships with natural-resource users who are incentivized to change their land-use and livelihood practices to avoid further biodiversity loss. In particular, direct incentives programmes that provide monetary benefits are commended for being effective in achieving conservation across short timescales. In biodiversity-rich areas, outside protected areas, such as coffee agroforestry systems, direct incentives, such as certification schemes, are used to motivate coffee producers to maintain native tree species, natural vegetation, restrict wildlife hunting, and conserve soil and water, in addition to encouraging welfare of workers. However, despite these claims, there is a lack of strong evidence of the on-ground impact of such schemes. To assess the conservation importance of certification, we describe a case study in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India, in which coffee growers are provided price incentives to adopt Rainforest Alliance certification standards. We analyse the conservation and social outcomes of this programme by studying peoples\xe2\x80\x99 experiences of participating in certification. Despite high compliance and effective implementation, we find a strong case for the endorsement of \xe2\x80\x98business as usual\xe2\x80\x99 with no changes in farm management as a result of certification. We find that such \xe2\x80\x98business as usual\xe2\x80\x99 participation in certification creates grounds for diminishing credibility and local support for conservation efforts. Working towards locally relevant conservation interventions, rather than implementing global blueprints, may lead to more meaningful biodiversity conservation and increased community support for conservation initiatives in coffee landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Forest resource conservation has been widely accepted as a key to sustain the local and regional economic development. The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations. Further studies are required to analyse the real patterns of regeneration and dynamic change due to human impact by long term monitoring with the establishment of permanent plots.'

Abstract: "Contamination-free, simple, cheap and efficient protocol for long term in vitro conservation of Ipsea malabarica (Reichb. f.) J.D. Hook, `the Malabar Daffodil Orchid', an endemic and endangered orchid of the Western Ghats of Kerala at the whole plant level was achieved. Strategies such as reduction in salt strength and medium with or without hormone/sugar were adopted for conservation in vitro. Culture vessel type significantly influenced the period of storage. Jam bottles were superior to test tubes for conservation. Half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 3% sugar and 1.5 mg l\xe2\x88\x921 kinetin in jam bottles facilitated storage of shoots up to 14 months without subculture which developed 25 shoots. Elimination of sugar from the above medium increased the storage period to 20 months. The shoots on this medium exhibited reduced growth and developed less than 12 shoots. Half-strength growth regulator free medium with sugar exhibited very slow growth and developed less than five shoots. This medium facilitated storage up to 20 months. Half-strength MS growth regulator and sugar free (photoautotrophic) medium was best for in vitro conservation and the storage period on this medium was 27 months. On this medium, the shoots grew very slowly and rarely developed another shoot. The culture was also free of contamination. Since 1997, about 100 of this threatened orchid have been maintaining in vitro at whole plant level."

Abstract: 'Earth Observation with large suite of sensors and with capabilities to address natural resources at multiple scales has proven to be a critical resource in setting conservation priorities of a region. The role of earth observation data was recognized towards achieving international biodiversity targets by 2020. Ecosystem irreplaceability and ecosystem vulnerability are two concepts key to understanding and preparing conservation priority maps. This study presents spatial conservation prioritization analysis for forests of \xe2\x80\x98Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot\xe2\x80\x99. Earth observation data products have been used for prioritization of areas of irreplaceability and vulnerability that are significant for conservation planning. The spatial surrogates of biodiversity in terms of very dense forest, biological richness, intactness and rarity of habitat are analyzed for evaluation of ecosystem irreplaceability. Fragmentation, forest fires, plant invasion and disturbance index are surrogates included for spatial analysis of ecosystem vulnerability. Vegetation type wise analysis indicates dry deciduous forests are under high vulnerability, followed by moist deciduous forests. The high concentration of irreplaceability is observed in Shola followed by wet evergreen forests and semi-evergreen forests. Spatial prioritization approach has identified about 18% of the forest area as irreplaceable which represents overlapped area of very dense forest, shola, intact forest and high biological richness. We observed that the overlap of forest areas of irreplaceability with vulnerability in southern Western Ghats, which needs high priority of conservation. This study is the first of its kind wherein multi-source earth observation data has been analysed to examine the quantitative criteria at regional level in Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'In fast-changing tropical landscapes, effective strategies for conservation must incorporate information on ecosystems and species distribution with that on landscape change. A possible methodology for conservation prioritization is developed and illustrated using a 27.5 km2 tropical landscape in the Western Ghats hill chain of southern India. Vegetation types or ecosystems within the landscape are ranked based on the ecosystem services they might provide: number of endemic species harbored, species richness, contribution to carbon uptake, economic value of produce per ha and contribution to soil renewal. For a vegetation type, the weighted average of these ranks indicates its net conservation value. Weights thus provide a means of ascribing differential importance to an ecosystem service. Information on landscape change is also summarized by a matrix depicting the likelihood of transformations between vegetation types present in the landscape, projected 5 years into the future. For each transformation between two vegetation types, information on ecosystem service and dynamics is then integrated. Implications from the perspective of conservation are assessed as the product of transformation probability and the resultant gain/loss in conservation value. Strongly positive transformations are likely to result in positive impacts on conservation value, and occur without any additional conservation effort. Strongly negative transformations are likely to occur and have a strong negative impact on conservation value. Maximum conservation effort may be directed at halting or reversing these. This study thus describes a method for conservation prioritization, which integrates information on ecosystem function and services with ecosystem dynamics.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the distribution and abundance of 4 species of diurnal primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque, Nilgiri langur and Hanuman langur, in 2 areas\xe2\x80\x94Brahmagiri-Makut and Sirsi-Honnavara\xe2\x80\x94in rain forests of the Western Ghats in the state of Karnataka, India. The Nilgiri langurs in Brahmagiri-Makut and the lion-tailed macaques in Sirsi-Honnavara are the northernmost populations of the 2 species in the Western Ghats. The 2 regions represent changes in ecological zones in the Western Ghats. In Brahmagiri-Makut, Hanuman langurs and bonnet macaques occupy lower elevations whereas Nilgiri langurs live in relatively higher altitudes. Only one group of lion-tailed macaques was in Brahmagiri-Makut. In the forests of Sirsi-Honnavara, 3 species of primates viz. lion-tailed macaque, bonnet macaque and Hanuman langur were in larger numbers throughout the forest. A self-sustainable single population of 32 groups of lion-tailed macaques occurred in Sirsi-Honnavara. Few subspecies of Hanuman langurs exist in the study regions. Due to local hunting practices, the relative abundance of primates in Brahmagiri-Makut is lower than that in Sirsi-Honnavara.'

Abstract: 'Hill forts of Northern Western Ghats offer an interesting mix of man-made and natural habitats and as a result shelter a great diversity of endemic and threatened plants. Strict protection of certain areas and selective interference for strategic reasons on hill forts are responsible for maintenance of large protected populations of local endemic species. This has also created special patterns of plant distribution. In recent years, many novelties have been described from forts. Though hill forts have gained importance from the historical and archeological point of view, they are seldom considered as biodiversity conservatories. We suggest here that while prioritizing conservation areas in Northern Western Ghats, hill forts should be given a status of local biodiversity hotspots and conservation should be provided to all microhabitats that are natural as well as man-made. This will assure protection of endemic and threatened species of Western Ghats as well as local endemics of Northern Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'This study highlights spatial characterization of evergreen forests of the Western Ghats \xe2\x80\x93 an ecological hotspot in Tamil Nadu, India \xe2\x80\x93 using remote sensing and GIS-based analysis in conjunction with ground-based phytosociological data. The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km2 are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km2, forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only 15\xe2\x80\x9328% of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.'

Abstract: 'Seventy one fish species belonging to 27 families and 50 genera were collected from various sampling sites spread along the upstream and downstream parts of the Chalakudy river, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in Kerala, South India. Cyprinids were the most dominant group represented by 24 species belonging to 13 genera, followed by the catfishes of the family Bagridae (7 species from 2 genera) and loaches belonging to the family Balitoridae (5 species from 5 genera). Of the 71 species, 4 belong to the \xe2\x80\x98critically endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (CR) and 16 to the \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (EN) category. 3 of the critically endangered species are strictly endemic to the Chalakudy river system. We also collected 5 exotic species several of them categorized as potential pest. Fish species richness (FSR) showed a direct relationship with increasing stream order with maximum values observed in the downstream/low elevation regions. Considerable differences were observed in the FSR between different microhabitats with maximum values observed in bed rock and pool riffle and the lowest in regimes followed by step pools. Diversity and species richness decreased with increasing altitude and higher diversity and species richness were observed in sampling sites located between 0\xe2\x80\x93200\xc2\xa0m above sea level. A definite temporal partitioning was also observed with regard to FSR with higher richness during the day time and the lowest observed at dawn. Indiscriminate collection of endemic and threatened ornamental fish species for export, exploitation of endangered food fishes by forest-dwelling communities and local fisher folk, pollution, loss of riparian cover, damming and exotic species threaten the rich ichthyofaunal diversity of Chalakudy River. An urgent need exists for studying the life history traits and demography of the most important endemic and threatened fishes, as lack of information on these aspects have significantly affected conservation efforts. The implementation of strong management strategies like fixing total allowable catch (TAC), and the use of quotas are needed to reduce the overall collection pressure with regard to the trade in native ornamental species from the river.'

Abstract: 'In order to understand the vegetative and reproductive phenological behaviour of Syzygium caryophyllatum, the knowledge of the factor influencing leaf flushing, maturation, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting of this tree species is required. The authors used field observations collected over 3\xc2\xa0years (2012\xe2\x80\x932015) at Neeliyarkottam sacred grove, Kannur district, Western Ghats of Kerala, India, to characterize the relationship between phenological pattern and biotic and abiotic (climatic) factors. The relationship between phenological pattern of the selected species and abiotic variables such as precipitation and temperature exhibited significant variation among the species. Flowering begins from second week of March to till May with a peak in April followed by the fruiting. Hand pollination tests indicated that most of the fruits were developed through xenogamous pollination. The breeding test results indicated S. caryophyllatum is self-incompatible and out-crossing is fertile. The foraging activities of some common pollinators on S. caryophyllatum flowers were also studied. The main flower visitors and foragers include honey bees, different varieties of butterflies, wasps, carpenter bees, small flies, bugs and ants. The flowering and fruiting exclusively occur in the dry season and are followed by germination and establishment of seedlings during the subsequent rainy season. The authors conclude that the investigations on the reproductive phenology, floral biology, breeding systems and pollinator visitation are important due to population survival of the species and its evolutionary success.'

Abstract: ' Decalepis arayalpathra, a critically endangered plant species, has a restricted and fragmented population in Southern Western Ghats, India. This study is a first attempt to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure in the nine wild populations of D. arayalpathra based on molecular pattern realized through the marker assays. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Nei\xe2\x80\x99s unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA)-based hierarchical clustering of both the marker assays suggest strong genetic clustering between the individuals corresponding to their geographical ranges. Mantel test also corroborates a close genetic proximity between genetic and geographic data (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.389). Population genetic analysis revealed low levels of gene flow [inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.289 and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.847] between the populations, in line with high genetic differentiation (Gst\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.531 with ISSR and 0.440 with RAPD), which was also supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), that 54\xc2\xa0% (ISSR) and 64\xc2\xa0% (RAPD) total variation resided within populations. Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis detected three genetic clusters showing the high degree of admixture within population. Based on the findings, such as inbreeding depression and the loss of genetic diversity, suggestions for conservation strategies are provided to preserve the genetic resources of this endangered species.'

Abstract: 'Spatially explicit approach is essential to prioritise the ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. In the present study, the conservation status of 20 protected areas of the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, was analysed based on long-term changes in forests (1975\xe2\x80\x931985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005\xe2\x80\x932013), landscape level changes in fragmentation and forest fires (2005\xe2\x80\x932015). This study has shown that a significant forest loss occurred in protected areas before declaration. Idukki is one of the major protected areas which showed a drastic reduction (18.83%) in its forest cover. During 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, Periyar tiger reserve had lost 24.19\xc2\xa0km2 core 3 forest area followed by Peppara (18.54\xc2\xa0km2), Parambikulam (17.93\xc2\xa0km2), Chimmony (17.71\xc2\xa0km2), Peechi-Vazhani (12.31\xc2\xa0km2) and Neyyar (11.67\xc2\xa0km2). An area of 71.33\xc2\xa0km2 of the protected area was affected by fires in 2014. Overall protected area-wise decadal analysis indicates Periyar has the highest number of fire incidences followed by Wayanad, Kurinjimala, Silent Valley and Eravikulam. Disturbances in the form of fires and fragmentation still exist and may have significant conservation threat to flora and fauna. Among protected areas, many are having a probability to go under threat or dynamic stage. Chinnar, Thattekkad and Kurinjimala sanctuaries are representing high levels of vulnerability, or they are near to decline stage. Habitat level monitoring of the anthropogenic disturbances can be efficiently useful for the strategic conservation planning. The present study has provided geospatial database on spatial patterns of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in protected areas of Kerala. Conservation prioritization approach based on these parameters will be useful for the strategic planning in the state of Kerala.'

Abstract: 'This study documents the distribution patterns, endemism and uniqueness (species richness) of fishes in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers of Western Ghats, India. We recorded 77 species represented by 7 orders, 16 families and 44 genera, of which 36 species are endemic to Western Ghats, 12 species endemic to India and 26 species endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. Based on our analysis on the distribution patterns, the Tunga River is richer in diversity and higher in endemism than the Bhadra. We calculated the similarity of the species composition among sites within these two rivers using the Jacquard index. The similarity index between the sampling sites of these rivers revealed that the similarity decreases with increasing distance between the sampling sites. Of the 77 fish species we collected, 8 species (11.1%) are in the Critical category, 10 species (13.8%) are in the High Risk category, 36 species (50%) are in the Moderate category and the remaining 18 species (25%) are at lower risk. The threat status of fishes found in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers strongly suggests the need for effective conservation measures to conserve the fish species richness of these rivers.'

Abstract: 'Climate change, alien species, and use of land for intensive farming and development are causing severe threat to the plant genetic diversity worldwide. Hence, conservation of biodiversity is considered fundamental and also provides the livelihoods to millions of people worldwide. Medicinal plants play a key role in the treatment of a number of diseases, and they are only the source of medicine for majority of people in the developing world. The tropical regions of the world supply the bulk of current global demand for \xe2\x80\x9cnatural medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d albeit with increasing threat to populations in the world and its genetic diversity. India is a major center of origin and diversity of crop and medicinal plants. India poses out 20,000 species of higher plants, one third of it being endemic and 500 species are categorized to have medicinal value. The Western Ghats is one of the major repositories of medicinal plants. It harbors around 4,000 species of higher plants of which 450 species are threatened. Currently, the number of species added to the red list category in this region is increasing, and the valuable genetic resources are being lost at a rapid rate. Demand for medicinal plants is increasing, and this leads to unscrupulous collection from the wild and adulteration of supplies. Providing high-quality planting material for sustainable use and thereby saving the genetic diversity of plants in the wild is important. During the last 25\xc2\xa0years of intensive research, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute has developed in vitro protocol for rapid regeneration and establishment of about 40 medicinally important rare and threatened plants of Western Ghats. In situ conservation alone would not be effective in safeguarding these important species. Thus, utilizing the biotechnoligical approach to complement ex situ conservation program is becoming vital. Propagating biotechnology tools in plant conservation program is a prerequisite to succeed in sustainable use and to complement the existing ex situ measures. In addition to propagation, storage of these valuable genetic resources is equally important. In vitro slow growth of 35 species and cryopreservation using embryo/meristem/seed in 20 different species of rare medicinal plants of this region is accomplished. Plants developed in vitro of ten medicinal plants, which have restricted distribution, were reintroduced in the natural habitat as well.'

Abstract: 'The status of the endemic and endangered lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) has not been properly assessed in several regions of the Western Ghats of southern India. We conducted a study in Parambikulam Forest Reserve in the state of Kerala to determine the distribution, demography, and status of lion-tailed macaques. We laid 5km2 grid cells on the map of the study area (644km2) and made four replicated walks in each grid cell using GPS. We gathered data on lion-tailed macaque group locations, demography, and site covariates including trail length, duration of walk, proportion of evergreen forest, height of tallest trees, and human disturbance index. We also performed occupancy modeling using PRESENCE ver. 3.0. We estimated a minimum of 17 groups of macaques in these hills. Low detection and occupancy probabilities indicated a low density of lion-tailed macaques in the study area. Height of the tallest trees correlated positively whereas human disturbance and proportion of evergreen forest correlated negatively with occupancy in grid cells. We also used data from earlier studies carried out in the surrounding Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Nelliyampathy Hills to discuss the conservation status in the large Anamalai Hills Landscape. This landscape harbors an estimated population of 1108 individuals of lion-tailed macaques, which is about one third of the entire estimated wild population of this species. A conservation plan for this landscape could be used as a model for conservation in other regions of the Western Ghats.'

Abstract: ' Coelogyne nervosa is an epiphytic orchid endemic to Western Ghats, South India. The mature seeds of C. nervosa were cultured on \xc2\xbd MS (Murashige and Skoog), MS, Kn (Knudson) and VW (Vacin and Went) media to evaluate the seed germination response. Of the four basal media used, MS medium supported maximum seed germination. Further experiments to enhance seed germination were done on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations (10, 20, 30 and 40\xc2\xa0%) of coconut water (CW). Thirty percent CW gave the highest response in terms of percent seed germination (96), fresh weight (7.2\xc2\xa0mg/seedling) and protocorm length (15.2\xc2\xa0mm). Since CW containing medium did not support further seedling growth, each seedling was isolated and cultured on MS medium supplemented with either BA (6-benzylaminopurine) or Kin (kinetin) alone (1.0\xe2\x80\x934.0\xc2\xa0mg/l each) or in combination with NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid; 0.2\xe2\x80\x931.0\xc2\xa0mg/l). Maximum growth was observed on MS medium supplemented with BA (3.0\xc2\xa0mg/l) and NAA (0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l). On this medium, the seedlings reached an average length of 3.6\xc2\xa0cm with 2.8 well expanded green leaves per seedling. Similarly optimum, healthy, white root induction (3.3 roots/seedlings) was also observed on the same medium. The rooted seedlings were successfully transplanted to pots with 91\xc2\xa0% success. The 2-year-old tissue culture derived plants produced normal flowers and fruits.'

Abstract: 'Understanding how different audience groups perceive wildlife is crucial for the promotion of biodiversity conservation, especially given the key role of flagship species in conservation campaigns. Although the heterogeneity in preferences reinforces the need for campaigns tailored to specific target audiences, many conservation education and awareness campaigns still claim to target the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral public\xe2\x80\x9d. Audiences can be segmented according to social, economic, and cultural criteria across which species perceptions are known to vary. Different studies have investigated the preferences of different groups towards certain wildlife species, but these are largely confined to a single conservation stakeholder group, such as tourists, local communities, or potential donors in western countries. In this study, we seek to determine from a multi-stakeholder perspective, audience characteristics that influence perceptions towards wildlife at Valparai, a fragmented plateau in the Western Ghats region of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka Hotspot. We found that stakeholder group membership was the most important characteristic followed by gender. While some characteristics had a wide-scale effect others were restricted to a few species. Our results emphasize the need to design conservation campaigns with specific audiences in mind, instead of the very often referred to \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral public\xe2\x80\x9d.'

Abstract: 'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the \xe2\x80\x98ecological units\xe2\x80\x99 with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR (1\xe2\x80\x934) through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.'

Abstract: 'As large nature reserves occupy only a fraction of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s land surface, conservation biologists are critically examining the role of private lands, habitat fragments, and plantations for conservation. This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.'

Title: 'Does environmental certification in coffee promote \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual\xe2\x80\x9d? A case study from the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'Conservation initiatives are designed to address threats to forests and biodiversity, often through partnerships with natural-resource users who are incentivized to change their land-use and livelihood practices to avoid further biodiversity loss. In particular, direct incentives programmes that provide monetary benefits are commended for being effective in achieving conservation across short timescales. In biodiversity-rich areas, outside protected areas, such as coffee agroforestry systems, direct incentives, such as certification schemes, are used to motivate coffee producers to maintain native tree species, natural vegetation, restrict wildlife hunting, and conserve soil and water, in addition to encouraging welfare of workers. However, despite these claims, there is a lack of strong evidence of the on-ground impact of such schemes. To assess the conservation importance of certification, we describe a case study in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India, in which coffee growers are provided price incentives to adopt Rainforest Alliance certification standards. We analyse the conservation and social outcomes of this programme by studying peoples\xe2\x80\x99 experiences of participating in certification. Despite high compliance and effective implementation, we find a strong case for the endorsement of \xe2\x80\x98business as usual\xe2\x80\x99 with no changes in farm management as a result of certification. We find that such \xe2\x80\x98business as usual\xe2\x80\x99 participation in certification creates grounds for diminishing credibility and local support for conservation efforts. Working towards locally relevant conservation interventions, rather than implementing global blueprints, may lead to more meaningful biodiversity conservation and increased community support for conservation initiatives in coffee landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Forest resource conservation has been widely accepted as a key to sustain the local and regional economic development. The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations. Further studies are required to analyse the real patterns of regeneration and dynamic change due to human impact by long term monitoring with the establishment of permanent plots.'

Title: 'Evaluating forest fragmentation and its tree community composition in the tropical rain forest of Southern Western Ghats (India) from 1973 to 2004'

Abstract: 'A majority of the research on forest fragmentation is primarily focused on animal groups rather than on tree communities because of the complex structural and functional behavior of the latter. In this study, we show that forest fragmentation provokes surprisingly rapid and profound alterations in tropical tree community. We examine forest fragments in the tropical region using high-resolution satellite imagery taken between 1973 and 2004 in the Southern Western Ghats (India) in relation to landscape patterns and phytosociological datasets. We have distinguished fragmentation in six categories\xe2\x80\x94interior, perforated, edge, transitional, patch, and undetermined\xe2\x80\x94around each forested pixel. Furthermore, we have characterized each of the fragment class in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forest in terms of its species composition and richness, its species similarity and abundance, and its regeneration status. Different landscape metrics have been used to infer patterns of land-use changes. Contiguous patches of >1,000\xc2\xa0ha covered 90% of evergreen forest in 1973 with less porosity and minimal plantation and anthropogenic pressures; whereas in 2004, the area had 67% forest coverage and a high level of porosity, possibly due to Ochlandra spread and increased plantations which resulted in the loss of such contiguous patches. Results highlight the importance of landscape metrics in monitoring land-cover change over time. Our main conclusion was to develop an approach, which combines information regarding land cover, degree of fragmentation, and phytosociological inputs, to conserve and prioritize tropical ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry in the Western Ghats (WG) of peninsular India and satoyama in rural Japan are traditional land-use systems with similar evolutionary trajectories. Some of their relevance was lost by the middle of the twentieth century, when modern agricultural technologies and urbanisation engineered shifts in emphasis towards maximising crop production. There has been, however, a resurgence of interest in traditional land-use systems recently, in view of their ability to provide ecosystem services. Both agroforestry and satoyama are thought to be harbingers of biological diversity and have the potential to serve as \xe2\x80\x9ccarbon forests.\xe2\x80\x9d Carbon (C) stock estimates of the sampled homegardens in WG ranged from 16 to 36\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. Satoyama woodlands owing to variations in tree stocking and management conditions indicated widely varying C stocks (2\xe2\x80\x93279\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). Agroforestry and satoyama also differ in nature, complexity, and objectives. While agroforestry involves key productive and protective functions, and adopts \xe2\x80\x98intensive management\xe2\x80\x99, the satoyama woodlands are extensively managed; understorey production is seldom a consideration. Differences in canopy architecture (multi-tiered structure of agroforestry vs. the more or less unitary canopy of satoayama) and land ownership pattern (privately owned/managed agroforestry holdings vs. community or local government or privately owned and mostly abandoned satoyamas) pose other challenges in the transfer and application of knowledge gained in one system to the other. Nonetheless, lessons learnt from satoyama conservation may be suitable for common pool resource management elsewhere in Asia, and aspects relating to understorey production in agroforestry may be relevant for satoyama under certain scenarios.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity and environmental conservation is important for today\xe2\x80\x99s critically degraded environment, so strategies must be developed using protected area networks such as biosphere reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve is such a valuable repository of floral and faunal biodiversity in the southern Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India, both in terms of species richness and endemism. A survey was carried out from September 2004 to June 2006 to assess the conservation status of medicinal plants which are used by the tribal people inhabiting the periphery of the reserve. More than 350 species of ethnomedicinal plants were recorded in the study with the association of tribal practitioners. Out of them, the ethnomedicinal plants Aglaia lawii, Arenga wightii, Chloroxylon swietenia, Eugenia singampattiana, Kingiodendron pinnatum, Orophea thomsonii, Polyalthia rufescens, Pterocarpus marsupium and Santalum album are \xe2\x80\x98Red Listed\xe2\x80\x99 plants. The majority of the plants of the reserve are rapidly getting threatened, because of the natural calamities and anthropogenic activities inside the forest areas. Thus, the reserve has high conservation value and its biodiversity is vulnerable to different factors so its conservation should receive great attention by involving the local communities and forest representatives.'

Abstract: 'The Red Data Book of Indian Plants (RDB) is a reference manual that lists threatened angiosperms, gymnosperms and pterydophytes. Because it is widely used as an analytical tool and is a major reference for impact assessments on vegetation, it is important that the RDB be as comprehensive and up to date as possible. This study is an attempt to cross-check the listings in the RDB using vegetation inventories and another reference manual, the Atlas of Endemics of the Western Ghats, India []. Field inventories across the Western Ghats gave an estimate of the species relative abundances and the Atlas provided quantitative information on the number of records for the endemic species in herbaria, literature, and during field surveys. The results of this analysis indicate that the RDB and the Atlas agree statistically regarding the conservation status of endemic trees. However, the proportion of threatened species per Atlas record category behaves erratically, indicating that some threatened endemic trees are not listed in the RDB. Our results suggest that the status of threatened plant species should be reexamined on a priority basis using quantitative methodology. An updating of the RDB is urgently needed, particularly for the endemic plants of the Western Ghats. We provide a list of species that are likely to be threatened, yet are not listed.'

Abstract: 'Given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests, the various protected areas\xe2\x80\x94national parks, sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves\xe2\x80\x94serve as the last footholds for conserving biological diversity. However, because protected areas are often targeted for the conservation of selected species, particularly charismatic animals, concerns have been raised about their effectiveness in conserving nontarget taxa and their genetic resources. In this paper, we evaluate whether protected areas can serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants that are threatened due to extraction pressures. We examine the population structure and genetic diversity of an economically important rattan, Calamus thwaitesii, in the core, buffer and peripheral regions of three protected areas in the central Western Ghats, southern India. Our results indicate that in all the three protected areas, the core and buffer regions maintain a better population structure, as well as higher genetic diversity, than the peripheral regions of the protected area. Thus, despite the escalating pressures of extraction, the protected areas are effective in conserving the genetic resources of rattan. These results underscore the importance of protected areas in conservation of nontarget species and emphasize the need to further strengthen the protected-area network to offer refugia for economically important plant species.'

Abstract: 'Fragmentation leads to the loss of connectivity among forested landscapes, which is important for biological conservation and biodiversity maintenance. Fragmentation analysis carried out on 20 years time interval in northern-Western Ghats revealed that, losses under moderate and high fragmented forests have decreased from 1985\xe2\x80\x9387 to 2005; however, it is not enough to compensate the loss of intact forests (not fragmented). The area of dense forests in intact forests has decreased from 1985\xe2\x80\x9387 to 2005, this essentially means the loss of quality habitat in the area. While investigating connectivity between fragmented patches by taking different topographical and ecological parameters into the consideration, it was observed that potential connectivity exists between protected areas present in northern and southern areas.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity, density, population structure and dispersion patterns of all trees and lianas (\xe2\x89\xa530cm gbh) were inventoried in a tropical semi-evergreen forest in the Shervarayan hills of Eastern Ghats, south India. Such data are necessary for ecosystem conservation of the under-studied Eastern Ghats, as extensive forests here have already been converted to coffee and orange plantations and the landscape changed due to aluminium ore mining and quarrying. Four 1-ha plots were established in Sanyasimalai (SM) reserve forest of the Shervarayan hills, one plot (SM1) located close to mining and quarrying area, two other contiguous plots (SM2 and SM3) located in selective felling area and the fourth (SM4) in a relatively undisturbed forest. These are 1 to 4km apart in the same semi-evergreen forest tract. In the four study plots a total of 3260 stems (mean density 815ha\xe2\x88\x921) covering 80 species in 71 genera and 44 plant families were recorded. Species richness was greatest in the undisturbed plot SM4 (50), while lowest (33) in the selectively felled site SM2. The forest stand (SM4) was also denser (986 stemsha\xe2\x88\x921) and more voluminous (basal area 44.3m2ha\xe2\x88\x921 as compared with the site mean of 35m2ha\xe2\x88\x921) than the other plots. Four trees, Chionanthus paniculata, Syzygium cumini, Canthium dicoccum and Ligustrum perrottetii dominated the stand, collectively contributing to >50% of the total density. Species richness and stand density decreased with increasing tree girths. The forest stand contained a growing population, but there was considerable variation in basal area distribution between the plots. Trends in species population structure varied, particularly for selective-felled species. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25ha and 1-ha scales. Variation in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts.'

Abstract: 'We analyze the structure and composition of old-growth wet evergreen forest of Nelliampathy hills, the chain of hills lying immediately south of Palghat Gap, in the southern Western Ghats of India. We sampled 30 plots of 0.1 ha each (50 m \xc3\x97 20 m) at six locations enumerating all plants \xe2\xa9\xbe 10 cm girth at breast height. We pooled the data and computed various structural parameters. There were 152 species of 120 genera and 51 families of the study area. Of these, 118 (77%) were trees, 24 were climbers (16%) and 10 were shrubs (7%). Species richness varied from 58\xe2\x80\x9399 per 0.5 ha sample and Shannon indices of diversity ranged from 4.4 to 5.2. Fifty-nine per cent (89 species) of the species were Indian Sub-continent elements and 34% (51 species) are endemic to the Western Ghats. Fifteen species are listed in various threat categories. Aglaia and Litsea were the most species-rich genera. Numbers of families ranged from 27\xe2\x80\x9343 per 0.5 ha sample. Euphorbiaceae and Lauraceae were the most species-rich families. Stand density varied from 1714 to 2244 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and basal area from 53.6 to 102.1 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921. The vegetation was dominated by 3\xe2\x80\x936 species and six dominance patterns characterized the species composition within the hill complex. The old-growth evergreen forests of Nelliampathy exist as small fragments rich in biodiversity and can be used as benchmarks for comparison with disturbed forests.'

Abstract: 'There are thousands of protected forest areas existing on earth, yet the deforestation rate continues unabated both inside and outside the protected areas especially in the tropical forests. It identifies the less effectiveness of the current conservation strategies, which is normally oriented around the forest area cover rather than the quality of the protected areas. This calls for realistic and effective management strategies for forests. Based on the drawbacks the present study aims at identifying conservation priority sites within the protected areas (Reserved Forests) of Shervarayan hills, Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. The remnant forest patches having less effective management/protection is identified and analysed for its qualitative contribution to the ecosystem. Quadrats of 20\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97 20\xc2\xa0m were laid in different vegetation based on the percentage of forest cover and assess the species diversity pertaining the richness, Endemism and Red list categories. Thematic layers (maps) such as vegetation type, floristic species richness, floristic endemism, and red list flora are created and categorized according to their weightage classes and overlaid in GIS domain to demarcate the Conservation Priority Zones (CPZ). The CPZ are classified according to the priority status i.e., high, moderate and low based on the contributing species richness, levels of endemism and concentration of Red listed plants.'

Abstract: 'Sacred areas are the oldest form of habitat protection, and many of these areas contribute to biodiversity conservation. While sacred groves have received considerable scholarly attention, little is known about fresh water swamps in the Western Ghats, India and sacred swamps have largely been ignored. This paper provides a first overview testing the conjecture that sacred swamps have physical features that distinguish them from non-sacred swamps. We assessed 110 fresh water swamps in the district of Uttara Kannada, Central Western Ghats, India, through extensive field surveys. Out of them 11 swamps are \xe2\x80\x98sacred\xe2\x80\x99 according to local testimony. Swamps are found in wet evergreen and evergreen forest types, but sacred swamps occur only in the wet evergreen forests. Sacred swamps differ significantly from non-sacred swamps with respect to size and shape, distance to the nearest road, human settlement, and commercial orchard, and population density within a radius of 500\xc2\xa0m. This shows that preferentially swamps close to settlements, orchards and roads have been declared as sacred, probably to regulate the continuing provision of relevant ecosystem services. While we find a variety of deities associated with these sacred swamps, the practices associated with sacred swamp status and management are essentially the same across belief groups. However, the conservation practice is at risk due to migration dynamics.'

Abstract: "We examined species turnover in stream amphibians in rainforest in two hill ranges (Ashambu and Anamalai Hills) in the Western Ghats in south India. In each hill range, six stream segments (100\xc2\xa0m in length) belonging to three drainage or rivers were surveyed three to four times in three seasons over 1\xc2\xa0year. Species turnover (using 1-Sorenson's index) was estimated between all possible pairs of sites at three spatial scales \xe2\x80\x93 within drainage, between drainage and between hill ranges. Similar matrices were also developed for altitudinal difference and geographic distance between sites. A total of 30 species in four families were recorded from 3681 individuals. The hill ranges differed significantly in the composition of the stream community at both the species and family levels. Within the hill range, species turnover was correlated with altitudinal difference and not with geographic distance. Anamalai Hills had a greater species turnover than Ashambu Hills, both within and between drainage. There was also a high turnover between these two hill ranges, with only two shared species. This turnover explains the fact that only 30\xe2\x80\x9340 species have been reported from different hill ranges, although regional diversity is high with about 130 species. The turnover also predicts that several undetected species should occur in hill ranges and drainage that have not been surveyed. The conservation model for mammals and birds, consisting of a few large protected areas, may not adequately address the conservation requirements of amphibians. Protection of rainforest frogs may require many protected areas in different drainages."

Abstract: 'Decades of commercial planting and other anthropogenic processes are posing a threat to the riparian landscapes of the Cauvery river basin, which supports a high floral diversity. Despite this, the habitats in the upstream sections of the River Cauvery are still intact, as they are located in sacred groves. To understand the dynamism of riparian forests exposed to anthropogenic pressures, the upstream stretch of Cauvery extending from Kushalanagara to Talacauvery (\xe2\x88\xbc102 km) was categorized into two landscapes: agro ecosystem and sacred (i.e. preserved). The tree species were sampled using belt transects at 5 km intervals and the regeneration status of endemic species assessed using quadrats. A total of 128 species belonging to 47 families, and representing 1,590 individuals, was observed. Amongst them, 65% of unique species were exclusive to sacred landscapes. A rarefaction plot confirmed higher species richness for the sacred compared to the agro ecosystem landscapes, and diversity indices with more evenness in distribution were evident in sacred landscapes. A significant loss of endemic tree species in the agro ecosystem landscapes was found. Overall, this study demonstrates that an intense biotic pressure in terms of plantations and other anthropogenic activities have altered the species composition of the riparian zone in non-sacred areas. A permanent policy implication is required for the conservation of riparian buffers to avoid further ecosystem degradation and loss of biodiversity.'

Abstract: '\nCoffee agroforestry is a conservation strategy that has shown promise to support the diversity of bird, bat, and insect communities, but few studies have focused on non-volant mammals in coffee farms. We assessed mammal diversity within coffee agroforestry systems in Kodagu, India and investigated the impacts of the non-native shade tree species, Grevillea robusta, on mammal diversity. Twenty farms, with varying amounts of G. robusta planted within the coffee farm, were sampled throughout three rainfall zones during the 4-month study period. We captured six species of small mammals, with indirect methods yielding an additional five species, totaling 11\xc2\xa0mammal species. Contrary to current ecological thought, we found that increased amounts of G. robusta did not have a negative impact on either abundance or richness of mammals. Small mammal abundances were higher at farms with greater amounts of herbaceous ground cover and larger, mature shade trees, while small mammal species richness was found to increase with an increase in tree species richness as well as greater amounts of herbaceous ground cover. Additionally, small mammal abundance was higher at coffee farms closer to forested areas. Based on these findings, we suggest the maintenance or cultivation of shade tree richness, mature shade trees, and herbaceous ground cover within coffee farms and preservation of forested areas within the landscape to enhance coffee agroforestry habitat for non-volant mammals. We hope that these habitat requirements will be incorporated into conservation strategies for the promotion of biodiversity within coffee agroforestry systems.'

Abstract: 'The composition, abundance, population structure and distribution patterns of all woody species (\xe2\x89\xa5 30 cm gbh) were investigated in an undisturbed and two adjacent human-impacted sites of a tropical wet evergreen forest in Kalakad National Park, Western Ghats, south India. Three 1-ha plots were established, one each in (i) an undisturbed site (named site UD), (ii) in a site selectively felled 35 years ago (site SF \xe2\x80\x93 small stems felled leaving the large trees (as shade) for developing it into a cardamom estate, on the failure of which the site was abandoned) and (iii) a frequently disturbed site (site FD \xe2\x80\x93 round woods logged for use in ovens for curing cardamom). These sites are 1 to 3 km apart in the same wet evergreen forest. In the three study plots a total of 2150 stems (mean density 716 ha\xe2\x88\x921) covering 122 species in 89 genera and 41 families were enumerated. Species richness was greatest (85 species ha\xe2\x88\x921) in the undisturbed site UD, intermediate (83) in SF and lowest (80) in FD. Tree density was greatest (855 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921) in site SF, intermediate (720) in UD and lowest (575) in FD. The forest stand was exceptionally voluminous in site UD (basal area 94.64 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921), intermediate (66.9 m2) in SF and least (61.7 m2) in FD, due to tree removal for fuel in the latter sites. Species composition and abundance patterns markedly varied between the three sites. In UD and SF, primary forest species (Cryptocarya bourdillonii , Cullenia exarillata Myristica dactyloides etc.) occurred in greater density. In FD heliophilic secondary forest species (Elaeocarpus venustus, Litsea wightiana, Viburnum punctatum and Vitex altissima) were abundant, while these were absent in UD and SF. The species\xe2\x80\x93area curve did not reach an asymptote in any of the sites on the 1-ha scale. The stand population structure was clearly reverse \xe2\x80\x98J\xe2\x80\x99 shaped in UD and SF, while small stems were 2- to 3-fold fewer in FD. Most trees exhibited clumped distribution of individuals on the 1-ha scale. Variation in the kind and richness of species and their abundance is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.'

Title: 'Dry season factors determining habitat use and distribution of mouse deer (Moschiola indica) in the Western Ghats'

Abstract: "Ecology of Asia's smallest ungulate, the Indian chevrotain or mouse deer (Moschiola indica), has been poorly assessed. We used camera-trapping data to investigate habitat use of mouse deer in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. Presence/absence data, collected under a systematic sampling framework, were used to test a priori hypotheses incorporating covariates believed to influence mouse deer occurrence and detection. The average occupancy rate of mouse deer in the study area was 0.56 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.22) with a low detection probability (0.29, SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.14). Model selection indicated that presence of moist bamboo brakes positively influenced while percent leaf litter negatively influenced mouse deer occupancy. Placement of camera-traps along narrow trails positively influenced detection probability of mouse deer. Future conservation efforts in India should focus on preservation of bamboo vegetation and dense forest cover which provide refuge for the mouse deer. Our results illustrate that occupancy can be suitable for monitoring elusive, forest dwelling, small ungulates; however, caution is needed when applying these models on small ranging species, as our study identifies the limitations in our survey design and its improvement for future monitoring which are applicable for similar-sized species across a range of habitats."

Title: 'Biodiversity inventory of trees in a large-scale permanent plot of tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'A permanent plot of 30 ha (600 \xc3\x97 500 m2) was established for long-term ecological research on biodiversity and forest functioning in a tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats. This paper gives the results of the first census of trees in the 30 ha plot. All trees \xe2\x89\xa530 cm gbh were permanently tagged with sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m2 respectively. The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand. The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey), Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4%). Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class. Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and will be useful for forest conservation and management. It will also help to monitor human activity within this forest.'

Abstract: 'Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has been used in combination with remote sensing and GIS techniques to assess the spatial pattern and annual rate of soil erosion in the Munnar Forest Division in Western Ghats, Kerala, India. The RUSLE takes into account several factors such as rainfall, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, land cover and erosion control practice for soil erosion prediction. Maximum soil loss of 109.31\xc2\xa0t h\xe2\x88\x921y\xe2\x88\x921 and the areas with extreme erosion (erosion is higher than 50\xc2\xa0t h\xe2\x88\x921y\xe2\x88\x921) are confined to 11.46% of the total area, while the area occupied by severe erosion (erosion rate between 25 and 50\xc2\xa0t h\xe2\x88\x921y\xe2\x88\x921) is 27.53%. The high rate of annual soil erosion is associated with areas of high terrain alteration from the plantation activities and highly elevated hills/plateau margins with steep side slopes. Such an output is highly useful in decision making context to avoid land acquisition in erosion risk areas, or, alternatively, to recommend soil conservation measures to reduce soil loss, if developmental activities are to be continued at high soil erosion risk areas.'

Abstract: 'Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is a valuable tree used in traditional medicine against a variety of ailments. Almost all parts of the tree are used for various commercial herbal preparations. Due to overexploitation, the species is rapidly disappearing from Western Ghats where it is native and grew extensively until recently. Conservation of this important medicinal plant is therefore an urgent need. To plan effective conservation strategies, a scientific assessment of the genetic diversity and distribution is needed.'

Abstract: 'Understanding of biodiversity on a local scale is extremely important for effective conservation measures, especially in biodiversity hotpsots hosting diverse endemic flora and fauna and subject to strong anthropogenic influences. Little is known about patterns of local biodiversity and the processes generating it in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot: the patterns of genetic diversity and biogeographic affinities are poorly known for most of the species from this region. We studied the genetic diversity and population structuring of an endemic frog Indirana cf beddomii, from 12 localities of Western Ghats using 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci. The genetic diversity as measured by mean expected heterozygosity (H E\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.83) or allelic richness (A r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010.41) was high and similar in all localities. Significant genetic differentiation (mean F ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.075) with a strong pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) across the localities was observed. Clearest genetic discontinuities in the data corresponded to topographic gaps suggesting that apart from IBD, genetic structuring in this species is strongly influenced by habitat matrix. In general, the results provide novel insight into factors that may impact the genetic diversity and population structuring of endemic amphibians in this biodiversity hotspot.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation in the biosphere reserves, which are key Protected Areas has negative impacts on biodiversity, climate, carbon fluxes and livelihoods. Comprehensive study of deforestation in biosphere reserves is required to assess the impact of the management effectiveness. This article assesses the changes in forest cover in various zones and protected areas of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the first declared biosphere reserve in India which forms part of Western Ghats-a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have mapped the forests from earliest available topographical maps and multi-temporal satellite data spanning from 1920\xe2\x80\x99s to 2012 period. Mapping of spatial extent of forest cover, vegetation types and land cover was carried out using visual interpretation technique. A grid cell of 1\xc2\xa0km\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x891\xc2\xa0km was generated for time series change analysis to understand the patterns in spatial distribution of forest cover (1920\xe2\x80\x931973\xe2\x80\x931989\xe2\x80\x931999\xe2\x80\x932006\xe2\x80\x932012). The total forest area of biosphere reserve was found to be 5,806.5\xc2\xa0km2 (93.8\xc2\xa0% of total geographical area) in 1920. Overall loss of forest cover was estimated as 1,423.6\xc2\xa0km2 (24.5\xc2\xa0% of the total forest) with reference to 1920. Among the six Protected Areas, annual deforestation rate of >0.5 was found in Wayanad wildlife sanctuary during 1920\xe2\x80\x931973. The deforestation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is mainly attributed to conversion of forests to plantations and agriculture along with submergence due to construction of dams during 1920 to 1989. Grid wise analysis indicates that 851 grids have undergone large-scale negative changes of >75\xc2\xa0ha of forest loss during 1920\xe2\x80\x931973 while, only 15 grids have shown >75\xc2\xa0ha loss during 1973\xe2\x80\x931989. Annual net rate of deforestation for the period of 1920 to 1973 was calculated as 0.5 followed by 0.1 for 1973 to 1989. Our analysis shows that there was large-scale deforestation before the declaration of area as biosphere reserve in 1986; however, the deforestation has drastically reduced after the declaration due to high degree of protection, thus indicating the secure future of reserve in the long term under the current forest management practices. The present work will stand as the most up-to-date assessment on the forest cover of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with immediate applications in monitoring and management of forest biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Expansion of coffee cultivation is one of the causes of deforestation and biodiversity loss. However, shade grown coffee has been promoted as a means for preserving biodiversity in the tropics. In this study we compared tree diversity in two types of coffee management regimes with the sacred groves in the Western Ghats of India. We computed species accumulation curves, species diversity indices and evenness indices to compare the different management regimes. Results of diversity indices showed that shade coffee had less diversity compared to sacred groves. Exotic species dominated the tree diversity in lands where the tree harvesting rights are with the growers. Native trees dominated the tree diversity when growers had no ownership rights on trees. A species accumulation curve suggested that the sacred grove had higher species richness compared to other two habitats. Lack of incentive to preserve endemic species as shade trees is forcing growers to plant more exotic species in shade grown coffee plots. If encouraged, shade grown coffee can preserve some biodiversity, but cannot provide all ecological benefits of a natural forest.'

Abstract: ' Ceropegia fantastica L. (Asclepiadaceae) is a highly endemic and endangered species in the Western Ghats of India. Fourteen microsatellite markers were developed for C. fantastica. Eight microsatellite primers screened had 2\xe2\x80\x935 alleles per locus and the observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.48 to 0.83 and 0.48 to 0.62, respectively. The primers were also evaluated for their cross amplification against two related species Ceropegia hirsuta and Ceropegia oculata. The microsatellites developed for this species could be used for addressing population genetics of this endemic and critically endangered species.'

Abstract: 'Equatorial rain forests that maintain a balance between speciation and extinction are hot-spots for studies of biodiversity. Western Ghats in southern India have gained attention due to high tropical biodiversity and endemism in their southern most area. We attempted to track the affinities of the pollen flora of the endemic plants of Western Ghat area within the fossil palynoflora of late Palaeocene-early Eocene (\xe2\x88\xbc55\xe2\x80\x9350 Ma) sedimentary deposits of western and northeastern Indian region. The study shows striking similarity of extant pollen with twenty eight most common fossil pollen taxa of the early Palaeogene. Widespread occurrences of coal and lignite deposits during early Palaeogene provide evidence of existence of well diversified rain forest community and swampy vegetation in the coastal low lying areas all along the western and northeastern margins of the Indian subcontinent. Prevalence of excessive humid climate during this period has been seen as a result of equatorial positioning of Indian subcontinent, superimposed by a long term global warming phase (PETM and EECO) during the early Palaeogene. The study presents clear evidence that highly diversified equatorial rain forest vegetation once widespread in the Indian subcontinent during early Palaeogene times, are now restricted in a small area as a refugia in the southernmost part of the Western Ghat area. High precipitation and shorter periods of dry months seem to have provided suitable environment to sustain lineages of ancient tropical vegetation in this area of Western Ghats in spite of dramatic climatic changes subsequent to the post India-Asia collision and during the Quaternary and Recent times.'

Abstract: 'Changes in tree and understory plant diversity and community composition in two sites at different disturbance levels were studied on the Anaikatty hills, Western Ghats. Systematic sampling using small scale permanent quadrates (50 \xc3\x97 20\xc2\xa0m for trees, 5 \xc3\x97 5\xc2\xa0m for shrubs/saplings, 1 \xc3\x97 1\xc2\xa0m for herbs/seedlings) enumerated 3,376 individuals of trees (106 species), 8,599 of individuals shrubs (122 species) and 16,659 individuals of herbs (145 species). Among the two sites, species richness and diversity were highest for low disturbed stand (98 and 3.9, respectively) compared to high disturbed site (45 and 2.71, respectively). Result of cluster analysis showed that two distinct clusters were formed on the basis of disturbance of the area in concordance with our field observation. A total of 37 species were common to both sites, sixty one species exclusively found in low disturbed site and eight species were pertained to highly disturbed site. Mann\xe2\x80\x93Whitney test based on Monte Carlo approximation at 95% confidence levels indicated that both populations were not entirely different. The clear difference was only observed for average basal area of trees, density of seedlings, number of species, density and diversity for shrubs and number of species and diversity for herb. The species composition were different in two stand i.e., Nothopegia racemosa\xe2\x80\x93Albizia amara\xe2\x80\x93Maba neilghrrensis in low disturbed stand and Albizia amara\xe2\x80\x93Pleiospermium alatum\xe2\x80\x93Bauhinia racemosa in high disturbed stand. The major disturbance factors identification using spearman rank correlation indicated that the disturbance in low disturbed habitats were mostly from past logging followed by cutting and illicit felling and grazing, while in high disturbed habitats, it was human presence, past logging and lopping and fuel wood collection.'

Abstract: 'While the conservation impacts of invasive plant species on tropical biodiversity is widely recognised, little is known of the potential for cultivated crops turning invasive in tropical forest regions. In the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India, fragmented rainforests often adjoin coffee plantations. This study in the Anamalai hills assessed the effects of distance from edges and forest structure on the occurrence and abundance of shade-tolerant coffee (Arabica Coffea arabica and Robusta C. canephora) in four fragments (32\xe2\x80\x93200\xc2\xa0ha) using replicate line transects laid from the edges into the interiors. The coffee species cultivated in adjoining plantations was more abundant than the other coffee species inside study fragments, showing a clear decline in stem density from edge (0\xc2\xa0m) to interior (250\xc2\xa0m), suggesting the influence of propagule pressure of adjoining plantations, coupled with edge effects and seed dispersal by animals. Significant positive correlations of coffee density with canopy cover indicate the potential threat of coffee invasion even in closed canopy rainforests. Stem density of Coffea arabica (150\xe2\x80\x931,825\xc2\xa0stems/ha) was higher in more disturbed fragments, whereas Coffea canephora had spread in disturbed and undisturbed sites achieving much higher densities (6.3\xe2\x80\x9311,486\xc2\xa0stems/ha). In addition, a negative relationship between C. canephora and native shrub density indicates its potential detrimental effects on native plants.'

Abstract: 'The main objective of this study is to integrate satellite derived forest burnt areas over a multi-decadal scale to understand fire frequencies in Silent Valley National Park, Kerala, India. There are nine vegetation types distinguished i.e. wet evergreen forest, shola, semi evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous forest, savannah, reed brakes, scrub and grasslands using Resoursesat-2 LISS III data. The spatial extent of burnt area found to be highly varying and has been estimated as 7.95\xc2\xa0km2 in 1973, 17.19\xc2\xa0km2 in 1985, 5.51\xc2\xa0km2 in 1989, 9.55\xc2\xa0km2 in 1990, 4.55\xc2\xa0km2 in 1994, 6.89\xc2\xa0km2 in 1996 and 5.80\xc2\xa0km2 in 1999. Analysis of burnt area coverage for recent decade based on 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 reveals fire affected area as 8.10, 4.20, 12.21, 5.52, 3.19, 0.62, 1.81, 2.03, 3.00 and 1.36\xc2\xa0km2 area respectively. Spatial analysis indicates, an area of 47.51\xc2\xa0km2 (19.5\xc2\xa0% of total vegetation cover) affected by varying frequencies of fires from 1973 to 2014. High frequencies of fires have been observed in dry deciduous forests and grasslands. Buffer zone of national park has undergone frequent fires which may degrade climax forest vegetation and affects the regeneration and adaptability of indigenous species. Spatial tracking reveals 58.1\xc2\xa0% grid cells were affected by forest fires. Overall, there is a declining trend of forest fires indicates management effectiveness in Silent Valley National Park.'

Abstract: 'We have used data generated using remote sensing and geographical information systems to categorize habitats, and then determined the relationship between the habitat categorizations and species-distribution patterns. A biologically rich hotspot\xe2\x80\x94Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, located at Southern Western Ghats, India, was chosen for this study. In order to spatially delineate areas of high species richness/diversity and endemic habitat zones, we have identified evergreen habitats in conjunction with landscape metrics, species assemblage, micro-habitats like slope, topography, species endemism, and proportion of core and edge species. A total of 236 species and 2,920 individuals were recorded using systematic stratified plots of 0.1\xc2\xa0ha covering 47 plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was done using Ward\xe2\x80\x99s method. Plot information was used to identify clusters based on species density. The analysis showed five species assemblages that are quite distinct from each other in terms of dominant species. The distribution of endemic and edge species, land cover heterogeneity, and continuity of patches in these clusters were evaluated to understand the degree of disturbance and intactness at landscape scale. Integration of species assemblages and topography brought out four major elevation-slope complexes. Information on species composition (robust field survey) with spectral (hybrid classification) properties has shown 72% overall accuracy and distinguished four evergreen sub-groups and other land cover classes. The developed approach assumes great importance in the assessment of biodiversity and prioritizing the areas of conservation.'

Abstract: 'Assessing the distribution, abundance and demographic ratios of endangered and elusive co-occurring carnivore species at a landscape level is important for their continued survival. Despite potential to determine distribution and dietary analyses, use of faecal samples has been relatively limited in the context of multiple sympatric species living at large landscapes. We developed and optimized a range of novel non-invasive molecular techniques for species, gender and individual identification of tiger (Panthera tigris) and leopard (Panthera pardus). We collected a large number of faecal samples as part of a pilot occupancy survey in the Malenad-Mysore Tiger Landscape, Western Ghats, India. We could genetically ascertain species and gender for 88 and 57\xc2\xa0% of the field-collected samples respectively. Additionally, we also determined a panel of nine and eight polymorphic loci for tiger and leopard individual identification, resulting in 18 tigers and 39 leopards from varied quality field-collected samples. Our pilot study suggest such molecular approaches will help in future efforts to gather landscape level distribution, demographic and other ecological information on tigers and leopards across their distribution.'

Abstract: ' Coscinium fenestratum is a critically endangered medicinal plant, well-known for its bioactive isoquinoline alkaloid berberine. The species has been over harvested from its natural habitats to meet the huge requirement of raw drug market and industrial consumption. This has lead to a rapid decline in the population size and has also led to local population extinction at few locations in the Western Ghats, India. In this study, inter-simple sequence repeat markers were used to investigate the genetic variation and population structure of seven extant populations of C. fenestratum from the central Western Ghats, India. Eight primer combination produced a total of 57 unambiguous bands, of which (47.1\xc2\xa0%) were polymorphic. The species exhibited a moderate to low level of intra population genetic diversity (H s\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.347\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.008; H t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.378\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.006 (POPGENE) and H s\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.262\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.0028; H t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.204\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.020 (HICKORY)). The populations were low to moderately differentiated from one another (G ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.221) and geographical distance was not significantly correlated with genetic distance, suggesting that these long-lived, geographically distant remnant populations were once connected through gene flow. There was a significant amount of genetic variation among populations (19.85\xc2\xa0%). The Bayesian software STRUCTURE and HICKORY were used to further reveal the genetic structure of C. fenestratum. The results revealed weak population structure (K\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02) with one single widespread gene pool, and indicated that gene flow and inbreeding are likely to be the major driving force in shaping current population genetic structure of C. fenestratum. Thus, an understanding of the genetic diversity and population structure of C. fenestratum can provide insight into the conservation and management of this species.'

To better understand the relationship between amphibians and cardamom, a study was undertaken at these plantations, which harbor numerous threatened and range-restricted amphibians. We undertook questionnaire surveys with 298 respondents at 148 plantations across southern India. Time-activity budget and diet analysis surveys were undertaken to determine whether amphibians really consumed cardamom. The conception that amphibians eat cardamom was found to be widespread especially among small-sized plantations, leading to negative perceptions and a lack of interest in amphibian conservation. The plantation community perceives a substantial economic loss due to amphibians, even though this is non-existent as revealed by our field surveys. These perceptions would lead to a continued intolerance of amphibian presence in plantations. A suitable outreach initiative re-affirming facts and spreading awareness on the positive role of amphibians would need to be conducted to negate this age-old myth.'

Abstract: 'Rural people in developing countries including India continue to access a number of types of \xe2\x80\x98forests\xe2\x80\x99 to meet specific needs such as fuelwood, fodder, food, non-timber forest produce and timber for both subsistence and income generation. While a plethora of terms exist to describe the types of forests that rural people use\xe2\x80\x94such as farm forests, social forests, community forests and small-scale forests\xe2\x80\x94the expression domestic forest has recently been proposed. Domestic forest is a term aimed at capturing the diversity of forests transformed and managed by rural communities and a way to introduce a new scientific domain that recognises that production and conservation can be reconciled and that local communities can be effective managers. This paper argues in the context of the central Western Ghats of south India that while the domestic forest concept is a useful umbrella term to capture the diversity of forests used by rural people, these domestic forests are often not autonomous local forests but sites of contestation between local actors and the state forest bureaucracy. Hence, a paradigm shift within the forest bureaucracy will only occur if the scientific forestry community questions its own normative views on forest management and sees forest policy as a means to recognise local claims and support existing practices of forest dependent communities.'

Abstract: 'Detailed karyotypic studies have been done in two critically endangered and endemic Crinum species viz. C. brachynema Herb. and C. woodrowii Baker, which belong to two ploidy levels 2x and 4x respectively. The mean chromosome length (MCL) for C. brachynema and C. woodrowii is more or less same. Both the species fall under 3b category of Stebbins classification and exhibit moderately symmetrical karyotype. The similarity in chromosome morphology is in contrast with the marked phenotypic differences exhibited by these two species which in fact belong to two different sections. As these species are under tremendous anthropogenic influence, this communication is an attempt to provide basic chromosome data on these species with the aim that this data can be useful in future breeding work as Crinums have great ornamental potential. This may finally help in domestication of these neglected species and will ultimately lead to their conservation.'

Title: 'How Do Climatic Predictors Affect Tree Richness in Western Ghats, India?'

Abstract: 'In this brief report, the relative importance of different climatic variables on structuring the spatial richness patterns of endemic tree species are quantified for Western Ghats of India, a biodiversity hotspot of the world. Path analysis and spatial multiple regression analysis are employed to measure the relative impacts of different climatic variables on the richness of tree species. Four climatic predictors, annual mean temperature (TEM), annual mean precipitation (PREC), annual evapotranspiration (AET), and elevation range (TOPO), are used to represent different perspectives of climatic variability. TEM represents temperature tolerance, PREC water availability, AET energy and TOPO habitat heterogeneity. Results show that, without removing spatial autocorrelation, AET is the most influential variable. However, the effect of AET was detected to be an artifact of spatial autocorrelation and after controlling such a misleading effect using simultaneous autoregressive models, the effects of other variables became evident and important in explaining the richness of endemic trees. All the statistical models consistently identified that TOPO and PREC are the equally influential variables for structuring richness patterns of endemic trees in Western Ghats. In conclusion, habitat heterogeneity and water availability are the most important predictors of richness in tropical endemic tree communities in Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats forms an important watershed for the entire peninsular India, being the source of 37 west flowing rivers and three major east flowing rivers and their numerous tributaries. However, deforestation due to large scale land cover changes has affected the water sustenance in the region evident from the quantity and duration of water availability during post monsoon period. Land use Land cover changes accelerated by unplanned anthropogenic activities have been the prime mover of global warming and consequent changes in the climate. This necessitates appropriate resource management with an understanding of drivers. Geo-visualization of landscape transitions considering the influential agents will aid in formulating strategies to mitigate global warming. Uttara Kannada district in the Central Western Ghats has the distinction of having highest forest cover in the country and this region is now experiencing rapid forest cover changes. Factors inducing changes in the land cover are normalized through fuzzyfication, considered for Multi criteria Evaluation using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) under high protection and low protection scenarios. Likely land use transitions by 2022 across zones based on transitions during 2004\xe2\x80\x932007, 2007\xe2\x80\x932010, 2010\xe2\x80\x932013 was done through cellular automata and Markov chain process (MC). The analyses highlight the loss of forest cover by 66.55\xe2\x80\x9356.76% by 2022 in the coastal zone with escalating population density. Similar situation of 65.98\xe2\x80\x9355.62% decline in Sahyadri region is noticed with execution of dams, hydroelectric projects and monoculture plantations. Lower transitions as compared with the second scenario highlights regulatory framework\xe2\x80\x99s role in protection. However, forests in plain region show loss of 27.38\xe2\x80\x9311.09% in both scenarios due to population pressure and market induced land cover changes. This necessitates policy interventions by the federal government to mitigate forest loss towards sustainable development.'

Abstract: ' Oryza malampuzhaensis Krish.et Chand. (2n = 4x = 48; Poaceae,Oryza) is endemic to Western Ghats, South India, and shows a highly localized distribution over a small geographical area in this region. This is the most poorly understood taxon in genusOryza and is often misidentified asO. officinalis owing to their close morphology. We assessed the nature and distribution of genetic variation among 11 populations ofO. malampuzhaensis using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The analysis revealed low genetic variation inO. malampuzhaensis. Cluster analysis of pairwise genetic distances of populations revealed three distinct clusters and the grouping of populations largely corresponded to their geographical proximity. Restricted gene flow and a geography-dependent differentiation were evident among populations. The altitude-influenced differences in ecological factors among the natural habitats of the populations seem to be the cause of the geography-dependent differentiation. Genetically isolated smaller populations and a narrow genetic base inO. malampuzhaensis point to its vulnerability to genetic drift and genetic depauperation. ThusO. malampuzhaensis appears to be under the threat of extinction and needs to be conserved by use of suitable methods. The present study also identified molecular markers diagnostic forO. malampuzhaensis.'

Abstract: 'Forty-five species of wild edible fruits were identified and traditional local knowledge of their usage was recorded in 40 villages of Kodagu district in Central Western Ghats, India one of the eight top hotspots of biodiversity in the world. We combined biodiversity inventory of trees with village interviews to record traditional ecological knowledge. Wild edible fruits were an opportunistic source of food for rural people. Wild edible fruits were rich in minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins, fats and fiber. In recent years there has been a decline in numbers of wild fruit trees due to changes in land use from uncultivated private wooded area to cardamom and coffee cultivation. The availability of wild edible fruits that were once very common on private cultivated areas has declined and their distributions are now restricted more to jungles and wildlife sanctuaries. We propose methods for conservation and describe the need for sustainable utilization to provide supplementary sources of nutritional and pharmaceutically useful edible wild fruits.'

Abstract: 'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is one of the most durable timbers in the world that is used for all conceivable purposes. Its widespread use has constrained the distribution of species to small and isolated populations. The genetic structure within and between nine natural teak growing forests of the Western Ghats of India belonging to the states of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu was investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to provide reasoned scientific management practices and conservation measures. The use of ten selective primer combinations on 180 samples (9 populations X 20 trees) resulted in a total of 665 bands of which 99.4\xc2\xa0% were polymorphic. Gene diversity index (H) varied from 0.1387 (Barchi) to 0.2449 (Wayanad). The mean gene diversity (HS) was 0.1995 and the total gene diversity (HT) was 0.264. The Southern Western Ghats populations showed higher within population gene diversity. The relative magnitude of genetic differentiation among populations (GST) was 0.244. Positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances was observed. PCoA, UPGMA and STRUCTURE analyses revealed the tendency of the individual trees within a population to align together indicating specific identity of each population. In the UPGMA dendrogram, Nilambur population joined separately with a large cluster in which the other Kerala populations and Tamil Nadu population formed sub clusters indicating a separate identity for Nilambur population among Southern Western Ghats populations.'

Abstract: 'Western Ghats are considered as one of the global biodiversity hotspots. There is an information gap on conservation status of the biodiversity hotspots. This study has quantified estimates of deforestation in the Western Ghats over a period of past nine decades. The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km2 (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., 1920\xe2\x80\x931975, 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. The grid cells of 1 km2 have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 1920\xe2\x80\x931975, 0.13 during 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 0.12 during 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 and 0.01 during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005. Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km2 (35.3% of the total forest) from 1920\xe2\x80\x99s to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km2 (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation.'

Abstract: 'The present work integrates analytical hierarchy process (AHP) with Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model to determine the critical soil erosion prone areas along with the spatial pattern of annual average soil erosion rates of an upland agricultural sub-watershed in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India. The critical soil erosion prone areas were identified by integrating geo-environmental variables such as land use/land cover, geomorphology, drainage density, drainage frequency, lineament frequency, slope, and relative relief after determining its relative contribution in conditioning the terrain susceptible to soil erosion by AHP technique, in a raster-based Geographic Information Systems environment. The spatial pattern of average annual soil erosion rates was obtained by RUSLE model that consider five factors, viz., rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodability (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors. The soil erosion probability map prepared by the AHP method was reclassified into soil erosion severity map showing regions of different erosion probability. Among this, the critical erosion zone occupies 4.23\xc2\xa0% of the total area followed by high erosion severity zone occupies 18.39\xc2\xa0% of the study area. Nil and low zones together constitute 44.15\xc2\xa0% of the total area. The assessed annual average soil loss from the watershed shows an increased value of 4,227\xc2\xa0t\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0h\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 as the maximum loss. The cross-comparison of potential soil erosion severity map with annual average soil loss in the area validates the finding of the study by a high spatial correlation. More erosion proneness and annual loss were observed in areas where the side slope plateau, denudational slope, and valley fills comes with high slope and relative relief. The intense terrain modification in this area with improper soil conservation measures makes the watershed more vulnerable to soil erosion.'

Abstract: ' Dysoxylum malabaricum (white cedar) is an economically important tree species, endemic to the Western Ghats, India, which is the world\xe2\x80\x99s most densely populated biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we used variation at ten nuclear simple sequence repeat loci to investigate genetic diversity and fine scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in seedlings and adults of D. malabaricum from four forest patches in the northern part of the Western Ghats. When genetic variation was compared between seedlings and adults across locations, significant differences were detected in allelic richness, observed heterozygosity, fixation index (F IS), and relatedness (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). Reduced genetic diversity and increased relatedness at the seedling stage might be due to fragmentation and disturbance. There was no FSGS at the adult stage and FSGS was limited to shorter distance classes at the seedling stage. However, there was clear spatial genetic structure at the landscape level (<50\xc2\xa0km), regardless of age class, due to limited gene flow between forest patches. A comparison of the distributions of size classes in the four locations with published data from a more southern area, showed that large trees (diameter at breast height, DBH, >130\xc2\xa0cm) are present in the southern sacred forests but not in the northern forest reserves. This pattern is likely due to stronger harvesting pressure in the north compared to the south, because in the north there are no cultural taboos regulating the extraction of natural resources. The implications for forest conservation in this biodiversity hotspot are discussed.'

Abstract: 'This article analyzes landscape pattern in the WesternGhats mountain ranges in south-western India at two scales,comparing small-scale, detailed studies of landscapepattern, with broader, regional-scale assessments of theWestern Ghats. Due in large part to their inaccessibility,relatively little is known about the landscapes of thisbiodiverse region, which also supports some of the highestpopulation densities in the world. A broad-scale NDVI-basedIRS 1B satellite image classification is used to analyzenorth-south and east-west trends across the entire WesternGhats and western coast of India, an area over 170 000 km2. Northern and eastern landscapes are morefragmented compared to the southern and western slopes.Western slopes also have greater landscape diversity withland cover types more interspersed compared to the easternslopes. These differences can be related to north-south andeast-west variations in rainfall and plant distribution. Data from thirteen landscapes 10\xe2\x80\x9350 km2 in area, arefurther utilized to analyze trends in landscape pattern, anddescribe the geographical distribution of major natural andmanaged ecotope types. At this scale, very high levels ofintra-ecotope type variability in landscape pattern areencountered for all land cover types. Results at these twoscales are integrated to suggest a hierarchical stratifiedapproach for monitoring land cover and biodiversity in the region.'

Abstract: 'Dysoxylum binectariferum Hook.f (Meliaceae) is a medicinally important medium to large-sized tree species found in tropical and subtropical regions. This species is distributed in the Western Ghats of southern India and is well known for its wood (Rao et\xc2\xa0al.1961). It has gained considerable interest in recent years because of the pharmacologically important compound rohitukine and its derivative flavopiridol. Rohitukine, a chromane alkaloid, is reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-fertility, anti-implantation, anti-cancer and immuno-modulatory properties (Naik et\xc2\xa0al.1988; Carlson et\xc2\xa0al.1996; Sedlacek et\xc2\xa0al.1996; Mohanakumara et\xc2\xa0al.2010). Dysobinin, the other chemical compound isolated from fruits of this tree is also reported to exhibit significant central nervous system depressant action and mild anti-inflammatory activity (Singh et\xc2\xa0al.1976). The bark is also reported to be used for the treatment of leprosy and foul ulcers (Jain and DeFilipps 1991).'

Abstract: 'The effect of fragmentation on different life forms within tropical forest plant communities is poorly understood. We studied the effect of degree of fragmentation and surrounding matrix on trees, lianas, shrubs and epiphytes in tropical forest fragments of Kodagu, Western Ghats, India. These fragments exist as sacred groves amidst a highly modified agricultural landscape, and have been preserved by the religious sentiments of local communities. Plants were sampled at two sites in continuous forests and 11 forest fragments. A total of 122 species of trees, 29 species of lianas, 60 species of shrubs and 66 species of epiphytes were recorded. Trees exhibited a significant species\xe2\x80\x93area relationship (R 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.74). Richness estimates after controlling for stem density (rarefaction) revealed that observed species\xe2\x80\x93area relationship was not an artefact of passive sampling. Variation in species richness of the other three groups was explained by stem density and structural diversity. Linear distance from the reserve forest did not explain any variation in species richness. All life forms exhibited significant nested pattern. Trees were nested along the area gradient while nestedness in the other three groups showed evidence in support of habitat nestedness. The four life forms thus responded variably to degree of fragmentation. Our study revealed that 74% of the regional diversity for trees was contributed by diversity among plots, highlighting the importance of inter-patch habitat diversity in maintaining the total regional species pool. We conclude that trees alone cannot serve as good indicator for taking appropriate conservation measures to mitigate species loss resulting from habitat fragmentation.'

Abstract: 'Assessment of vulnerability is an important step in building long-term resilience in the forestry sector. The objective of this paper is to present a methodological approach to assess inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level. The approach involves use of vulnerability indicators, the pairwise comparison method, and geographic information system (GIS) tools. We apply this approach to assess the inherent vulnerability of forests of the Western Ghats Karnataka (WGK) landscape, which is a part of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. Four vulnerability indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope, are selected. We find that forests in 30, 36, 19, and 15\xc2\xa0% grid points in this region show low, medium, high, and very high inherent vulnerability, respectively. The forest showing high and very high inherent vulnerability are mostly dry deciduous forests and plantations located largely on the eastern side of the landscape. We also find that canopy cover is one of the key indicators that determine the inherent vulnerability of forests, and natural forests are inherently less vulnerable than man-made plantations. Spatial assessment of inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level is particularly useful for developing strategies to build resilience to current stressors and climate change in future.'

Abstract: 'Within a 30-ha permanent plot of a tropical evergreen forest in the Anamalais, Indian Western Ghats, all the 13\xe2\x80\x89415 trees \xe2\x89\xa530\xe2\x80\x89cm\xe2\x80\x89gbh (belonging to 153 species) were identified and tagged during 1997\xe2\x80\x931998. This communication reports the results of tree population changes based on two annual censuses (1999 and 2000) of the plot after the initial census, and compares the results with other tropical forest sites. One species, Ficus beddomei, disappeared from the plot and there was no new addition of species. Of the 96 species that showed changes in their population density, for 12 species recruitment and mortality matched. Tree recruitment (5 trees\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921) exceeded mortality (4 trees\xe2\x80\x89ha\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921) during the two-year period. Four modes of tree deaths were recorded in our site. The per cent mortality of trees differed between tree size classes during each recensus. The plot tree density increased progressively in the two-year period, indicating that shifts in species composition and density in natural forests, without major catastrophic disturbance, occur slowly.'

Title: 'Morphometrical analysis of two tropical mountain river basins of contrasting environmental settings, the southern Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'The morphometric analysis of river basins represents a simple procedure to describe hydrologic and geomorphic processes operating on a basin scale. A morphometric analysis was carried out to evaluate the drainage characteristics of two adjoining, mountain river basins of the southern Western Ghats, India, Muthirapuzha River Basin (MRB) in the western slopes and Pambar River Basin (PRB) in the eastern slopes. The basins, forming a part of the Proterozoic, high-grade, Southern Granulite Terrain of the Peninsular India, are carved out of a terrain dominantly made of granite- and hornblende-biotite gneisses. The Western Ghats, forming the basin divide, significantly influences the regional climate (i.e., humid climate in MRB, while semi-arid in PRB). The Survey of India topographic maps (1:50,000) and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation data were used as the base for delineation and analysis. Both river basins are of 6th order and comparable in basin geometry. The drainage patterns and linear alignment of the drainage networks suggest the influence of structural elements. The Rb of either basins failed to highlight the structural controls on drainage organization, which might be a result of the elongated basin shape. The irregular trends in Rb between various stream orders suggest the influence of geology and relief on drainage branching. The Dd values designate the basins as moderate- to well-drained with lower infiltration rates. The overall increasing trend of Rl between successive stream orders suggests a geomorphic maturity of either basins and confirmed by the characteristic I hyp values. The Re values imply an elongate shape for both MRB and PRB and subsequently lower vulnerability to flash floods and hence, easier flood management. The relatively higher Rr of PRB is an indicative of comparatively steeply sloping terrain and consequently higher intensity of erosion processes. Further, the derivatives of digital elevation data (slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, and stream power index), showing significant differences between MRB and PRB, are useful in soil conservation plans. The study highlighted the variation in morphometric parameters with respect to the dissimilarities in topography and climate.'

Abstract: ' Decalepis arayalpathra, an endangered, endemic ethnomedicinal plant from southern Western Ghats, India, is targeted for its aromatic and medicinal properties. This study aimed at to identify fungal endophyte populations associated with healthy and diseased roots of this perennial shrub. Healthy and rotted root samples of D. arayalpathra were collected, fungal endophytes assemblages were identified both by culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, further sequenced and the retrieved sequences were analysed with the reference sequences in GenBank to know their phylogenetic relationships. Analysis of the ITS rDNA region generated 24 different Ascomycota and three Basidiomycota taxa. Trichoderma sp. was most abundant in healthy and diseased root samples, while Penicillium and Aspergillus were confined to healthy roots. Furthermore, Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum and Mucor velutinosus were found to be the most frequent fungi identified from the rotted root samples, thus substantiated to be the cause for D. arayalpathra decline in the wild. Interestingly, the strains assigned to Fusarium sp. were isolated from diseased roots showing typical clearly visible symptoms, such as a severe brown discolouration on the taproot. Molecular profiling of all the pure fungal isolates, viz., Trichoderma, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Mucor, revealed high sequence similarities (\xe2\x89\xa5 98\xc2\xa0%) to corresponding reference sequences. Sequencing of Trichoderma pure cultures isolated from healthy and diseased roots revealed sequence similarities to Trichoderma harzianum, T. hamatum, T. koningiopsis, T. asperellum, T. pubescens and Hypocrea sp. This confirms the morphological examinations, as Hypocrea is the teleomorph stage of Trichoderma sp. This study signifies the first work pertaining to the taxonomy of the fungal endophytic community of D. arayalpathra, and the results reported in this work may help to ascertain the cause of root rot disease often perceived in D. arayalpathra. Also, it could be useful to identify the promising endophytic communities against the root rot diseases occurring in D. arayalpathra.'

Title: 'Factors Affecting Recruitment of a Critically-Endangered Dipterocarp Species, Vateria indica in the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: ' Vateria indica is a critically-endangered and economically-important tree endemic to the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in India. Due to extreme local endemism and anthropogenic destructive harvesting of resin, the species is categorized as critically endangered. The present study investigated the biotic limiting factors of recruitment of V. inidica in its natural populations, and studied the pattern of anthropogenic harvest of nuts of V. indica in the recent past. Seed predation and seedling herbivory particularly by insects were assessed. The sustainability of the nut harvest was assessed by conducting pre- and post-harvest censuses of nuts on forest floors. Over 90\xc2\xa0% of the fruits of V. indica were infested by the insects, but, only about 10\xc2\xa0% of the infested fruits were seed-predated. Seedling herbivores included a leaf miner, ants of two species, and larvae of a lymantrid moth. Seedling mortality due to herbivores was moderate (45.5\xc2\xa0%). Pre- and post-harvest censuses showed that only 3.81\xc2\xa0% of the fruits that were naturally-fallen on the forest floor were spared after the harvest had taken place. Sringeri has exported 820 metric tons of nuts in the study year, which was an all-time high estimate. The study concludes that the anthropogenic nut collection can hamper the population structure of V. indica locally. Since V. indica has an alternate-year major flowering cycle, the seed loss as seen in the present study is critical. Raising plantations of V. indica as an afforestation program can contribute to the conservation of the species and the development of local communities.'

Abstract: 'The objective of the present work is to study the chemical variation in Calophyllum inophyllum growing along the Western Ghats of India. Contents of dipyranocoumarins (inophyllums) in C.\xc2\xa0inophyllum were determined to assess whether they could be used as a taxonomic marker for C.\xc2\xa0inophyllum. This study also aims to establish inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers that can be used to study genetic variation within the species and explore correlation between ISSR and chemical markers. The contents of dipyranocoumarins were estimated in seeds collected from 20 locations. Leaves from plants at the same 20 locations were assayed for ISSR variation. A dendrogram based on Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic distance as well as principal component analysis based on dipyranocoumarins and ISSR variation clustered plants from these 20 locations into three groups that indicated close relationship among ISSR, dipyranocoumarins contents, and geographical position (variation) of locations. Based on this study, two locations of elite plants were identified.'

Abstract: 'Eleven populations of the tetraploid Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt were collected from five forest ranges along the Western Ghats in Kerala, South India. Multivariate discriminant analysis using 15 morphological characters revealed a high degree of variation within the taxon. Such infra-specific taxonomic diversity points to the perpetuation of the polyploid segregants at different localities as a result of selection under varying micro ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Man\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to intensify the use of natural resources can often result in the exhaustion of the resource or deterioration of other interacting resources. The single-minded pursuit of the development of the water resources of the rivers of the Western Ghats shows many examples of this view, particularly in the unnecessary destruction of the dwindling forest resources. This destruction may be caused by (i) problems o f rehabilitation, e.g. the Ramanagar settlement of the Kalinadi project (ii) the impact of labourers, e.g. the destruction of evergreen sholas on the Upper Nilgiri plateau (iii) the access to encroachers and poachers, e.g. Panshet and Kalinadi (iv) faulty planning, e.g. Linganamakki and Kalinadi. This destruction of forest cover has had a number of deleterious consequences in (i) worsening the shortages of forest resources, (ii) hastening the siltation of the reservoirs, (iii) ecological imbalances as in the rapid spread ofEupatorium in the Kalinadi project area and (iv) the decimation of biological diversity, as in the great reduction of evergreen forests in the Western Ghats, threatening the survival of lion-tailed macaque and the extinction of grass species,Hubbardia heptaneuron. It is stressed that the only sustainable and therefore true development is environmentally sound development. The interests of the weaker sections of the society often provide a good index of the soundness of the development from an environmental point of view. The planning of the development process with this perspective is a great scientific and technological challenge that must be taken up.'

Abstract: 'Herbaceous vascular epiphytes were screened in a total sample of 13 445 trees (in 153 species) and 348 lianas (in 30 species) \xe2\x89\xa530 cm girth at breast height in a 30 ha plot of tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Indian Western Ghats. Of these, 4.3% of trees and 3.7% of lianas were infested with epiphytes. Epiphyte diversity totaled 26 species in 19 genera and 10 families. Sixteen species were angiosperms in three families (Orchidaceae 54%; Piperaceae and Araceae 8%) and 10 species (38%) were pteridophytes in seven families. The orchid, Pholidota pallida was most abundant and occurred on 178 (29.6%) stems. Asplenium nidus occurred on the maximum of 62 host species. The species richness estimators employed for species accumulation curves after 100 times randomization of sample order have stabilized the curve at 18th and 19th hectares respectively for Incidence-based Coverage Estimator and Chao2. A total of 588 trees and 13 liana stems lodged epiphytes, 74% of which were evergreen species and 26% deciduous. Epiphyte density was greater (56%) in deciduous species (Bischofia javanica 30% and Vitex altissima 8%). A significant positive relationship was found between trunk size and epiphyte association. Larger epiphyte species occurred mostly on middle and larger stems and smaller epiphyte species occurred on smaller stems. The majority of epiphytes (92%) were of autochorous dispersal type, bearing capsule or dust diaspores, while the remaining species with berries and nutlets are dispersed by small vertebrates.'

Abstract: 'The center of diversity of Piper nigrum L. (Black Pepper), one of the highly valued spice crops is reported to be from India. Black pepper is naturally distributed in India in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot and is the only known existing source of its wild germplasm in the world. We used ecological niche models to predict the potential distribution of wild P. nigrum in the present and two future climate change scenarios viz (A1B) and (A2A) for the year 2080. Three topographic and nine uncorrelated bioclim variables were used to develop the niche models. The environmental variables influencing the distribution of wild P. nigrum across different climate change scenarios were identified. We also assessed the direction and magnitude of the niche centroid shift and the change in niche breadth to estimate the impact of projected climate change on the distribution of P. nigrum. The study shows a niche centroid shift in the future climate scenarios. Both the projected future climate scenarios predicted a reduction in the habitat of P. nigrum in Southern Western Ghats, which harbors many wild accessions of P. nigrum. Our results highlight the impact of future climate change on P. nigrum and provide useful information for designing sound germplasm conservation strategies for P. nigrum.'

Abstract: 'Plants diversity and phenological pattern of the trees were monitored in a montane wet temperate forest (shola) in the Kukkal Forest, Palni hills of the southern Western Ghats, India. Twelve random plots were selected for sampling the vegetation. For phenological studies, twenty-three fleshy fruit trees were identified in the study area and 10 individuals of each species were selected to record the phenological events fortnightly between April 2002 and April 2004. The phenological events were divided into vegetative and reproductive phases. A total of 2279 individuals were inventoried which belong to 83 species, 68 genera and 40 families. About 30% of the species were endemic to the Western Ghats. The most dominant species (\xe2\x89\xa5 1 cm dbh) was Psychotria nilgiriensis var. astephana (Rubiaceae), which accounted for 12% of the total sampled individuals. Lauraceae was the dominant family accounting for 20% of the individuals. Fruiting peak occurred in July 2003 and least in June 2002. During the peak period, fruits of 85 individuals of six species were observed. Syzygium tamilnadensis, Ilex wightiana and Beilschmiedia wightii fruited only once during the two years of study. The number of fruiting species showed no correlation with rainfall (r = 0.26, p = 0.2), while a correlation was found with fruit abundance (r = 0.40, p < 0.05). The results indicate that the montane wet temperate forest is unique in their diversity and a conspicuous display in phenology.'

Abstract: "Young shoots collected from mature trees of Calophyllum apetalum during the flush season (November\xe2\x80\x93February) were red (1\xe2\x80\x932 weeks), pinkish-red (3\xe2\x80\x935 weeks), pale green (6\xe2\x80\x938 weeks) and dark green (9\xe2\x80\x9310 weeks) coloured after different periods of growth. All the shoot tip and single node explants of the youngest 1\xe2\x80\x932-week-old shoots cultured in Murashige and Skoog's (1962) agar medium were lost due to excessive browning and necrosis; nodes of the 6\xe2\x80\x938-week-old shoots subjected to transfers twice a week in fresh medium containing 8.8 \xce\xbc;M BAP responded the most (68% of explants) with the formation of 3.2 shoots per explant in 7 weeks. The shoot tip was a relatively poor source of regeneration (2.3 shoots per explant; 39% of explants). Subculturing of explants from in vitro derived shoots for 5 weeks in medium containing 4.4 \xce\xbcM BAP resulted in the formation of an increased number and percentage of shoots in the nodes (5.3 per explant; 74% of explants). The shoot cultures were transferred to 1/2 MS basal medium for 4 weeks to induce the elongation of shoots (\xe2\x88\xbc;3.0 cm). Rooting of the microshoots (>2.0 cm) was achieved when cultured in quarter strength MS medium supplemented with 9.8 \xce\xbc;M IBA for 4 weeks followed by transfer to 1/4 MS basal medium for 4 weeks. The rooted plantlets transferred to clay pots filled with soil, sand and farmyard manure (1:1:1), maintained in a mist chamber at a relative humidity of 80\xe2\x80\x9390%, acclimatised at a 56% rate after 6 weeks. Out of 345 plants restored to their native habitat in the forest at three locations of the institute campus, 293 plants survived and showed uniform growth free of morphological defects."

Abstract: 'DNA barcodes analyzed by using relevant techniques provide an imperative approach towards validation of prevailing taxa and putative species. Here, molecular methods were used for assessment of 246 barcodes belonging to 81 fish species from northern Western Ghats of India, using, Barcode gap analysis, barcode index number, automatic barcode gap discovery, Poisson tree processes and general mixed Yule-coalescent, these methods had their potential to discriminate 97.53%, 93.90% 95.06%, 93.82% and 92.59% of species respectively. But, some of them tended to estimate the inconsistent number of species leading to discrepancies between the morphological concept and inference from molecular phylogenetic reconstructions. So, we took a standard approach to recognize those methods that produced consistent results, three of five such methods were identified that revealed three hidden cryptic species complexes in Monopterus indicus, Parambassis ranga and Systomus sarana. Further, to validate these three genetically diverged species, we used diagnostic character based approach along with nine unidentified species through BLOG and WEKAs SMO classifier. Those methods were unable to identify these species, which might be due to the limited number of specimens used for the analysis. This is the first effort to generate the DNA barcode reference library of freshwater fishes from northern Western Ghats of India, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity hotspots. These barcodes when analyzed through the defined workflow, will provide valuable measures to prove the efficiency of molecular species delimitation methods in taxonomic discrimination which aid conservation of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Soil and water conservation along with crop productivity improvement is indispensable for sustainable development of rainfed areas. Integration of suitable fruit trees within the cropping system can reduce risk allied with rainfed farming. The system of raising multi-height plant species with agricultural crops known as multitier agroforestry system was assessed (2007\xe2\x80\x932010) for resource conservation and production potential in rainfed conditions of Eastern Ghats region in India. Thirty experimental plots, each of 18\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa012\xc2\xa0m dimension with 2\xc2\xa0% slope having different multitier agroforestry treatments were assessed for soil erosion, nutrient loss and crop yield. Results revealed that multitier plantation of drumstick (Moringa oleifera) with Gliricidia sepium hedgerow and ginger (Zingiber officinale): pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) (8:2) intercropping enumerated minimum mean runoff (8.26\xc2\xa0%) and soil loss (3.45\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). This treatment saved 74\xc2\xa0% more soil organic carbon, 64\xc2\xa0% more phosphorus and 66\xc2\xa0% more potassium, respectively than broadcasted finger millet cultivation (traditional farmers\xe2\x80\x99 practice). An increase of 24\xe2\x80\x9327\xc2\xa0% drumstick fruit yield was observed in Gliricidia hedgerow based multitier agroforestry systems over non-Gliricidia systems. The findings will contribute as a technical reference for the promotion of hedgerow based multitier agroforestry for resource conservation and fertility restoration of sloping lands.'

Abstract: 'Habitat fragmentation is considered the most serious threat to primate conservation in the tropics, and understanding it effects on lion-tailed macaque is very important because most of the populations live in fragmented habitats. We examined demographic parameters of 9 lion-tailed macaque groups in 8 rain forest fragments with reference to fragment area, tree density, canopy cover, tree height, and total basal area of food trees. Group size ranged from 7 to 90 individuals but was not related to habitat variables. Birth and growth rates of groups did not differ significantly between small (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894) and large (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894) fragments. Tree density, canopy cover, and total basal of food trees all show strong positive correlations with fragment area. Growth rate correlates with tree density, but there are no other significant relationships between birth or growth rate and habitat variables. The percentage of immature individuals in the group is significantly positively associated with the total basal area of food trees, but not with any other habitat variable. Comparison of our data from this study with data available for the same population in 1996 indicates a slight decline in birth rate but an increase in total number of individuals, from 154 to 242. Of the 5 small fragment groups, 3 have increased in size since 1996 while the sizes of the other 2 groups have remained the same. Based on this study, we advocate that to manage the fragile lion-tailed macaque groups the following steps need to be taken: 1) create dispersal corridors between the fragments using fruit trees to facilitate male dispersal, 2) construct canopy bridges across the prevailing roads, 3) protect the fragments from further degradation, and 4) periodically monitor these populations for long-term conservation.'

Abstract: 'Frogs in the genus Indirana are endemic to Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. The species are poorly studied and in many cases threatened or endangered. Here we describe primers and polymerase chain reactions for 62 microsatellite loci for Indirana beddomii, one of the commonest frogs in the genus. Fifty-six of the primers were polymorphic on sample of 23 individuals from a single sampling site (Ponmudi, Kerala) with an average 9.11 alleles per locus (range\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9320). The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.64 and 0.71, respectively. The loci should be useful in conservation genetic studies of Indirana frogs.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity and ecosystem services play key roles in future economic strategies seeking to promote development and prosperity. This study assesses the status of biodiversity and flow of ecosystem services from selected forest types in the Western Ghats. At the sampling sites, the number of tree species ranged from 16 to 79 per hectare depending on the forest type. The estimates for Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener index for trees in the evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forest plots were 3.02, 2.9 and 1.54, respectively. The total biomass carbon stocks in evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forests in the study area was 229, 221 and 189\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C/ha, respectively. Analysis of dependency patterns of local communities on forest resources indicated a high dependency on provisional services such as fuelwood, manure and fodder. The study records the highest dependency rates for fuelwood, ranging between 72 and 100% for the three forest types and indicates that forest ecosystems underpin the well-being of the population dependent directly and indirectly on them.'

Abstract: 'Biologically mediated soil processes rely on soil biota to provide vital ecosystem services in natural and managed ecosystems. However, land use changes continue to impact on assemblages of soil biota and the ecosystem services they provide. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of land use intensification on the distribution and abundance of soil invertebrate communities in the Nilgiri, a human-dominated biosphere reserve of international importance. Soil invertebrates were sampled in 15 land use practices ranging from simple and intensively managed annual crop fields and monoculture tree plantations through less intensively managed agroforestry and pristine forest ecosystems. The lowest taxonomic richness was found in annual crops and coconut monoculture plantations, while the highest was in moist-deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. With 21 ant species, agroforestry systems had the highest diversity of ants followed by forest ecosystems (12 species). Earthworms and millipedes were significantly more abundant in agroforestry systems, plantations and forest ecosystems than in annual crop fields. Ants, termites, beetles, centipedes, crickets and spiders were more abundant in forest ecosystems than in other ecosystems. It is concluded that annual cropping systems have lower diversity and abundance of soil invertebrates than agroforestry and natural forest ecosystems. These results and the literature from other regions highlight the potential role that agroforestry practices can play in biodiversity conservation in an era of ever-increasing land use intensification and habitat loss.'

Abstract: 'Contrary to expectations, some human-modified landscapes are considered to sustain both human activities and biodiversity over the long-term. Agroforestry systems are among these landscapes where crops are planted under native shade trees. In this context, ancient agroforestry systems can provide insight into how farmers managed the landscape over time. Such insight can help to quantify the extent to which tropical forests (especially habitat-specialist trees) are responding to local and landscape-level management. Here, we extracted fossil pollen (indicator of past vegetation changes) and macroscopic charcoal (indicator of biomass burning) from four forest hollows\xe2\x80\x99 sedimentary sequences in an ancient agroforestry system in Western Ghats, India. We used a mixed-modelling approach and a principal components analysis (PCA) to determine past trajectories of forest change and species composition dynamics for the last 900\xc2\xa0years. In addition, we reconstructed the long-term forest canopy dynamics and examined the persistence of habitat-specialist trees over time. Our results show that the four sites diverged to a surprising degree in both taxa composition and dynamics. However, despite these differences, forest has persisted over 900\xc2\xa0years under agricultural activities within agroforestry systems. This long-term analysis highlights the importance of different land-use legacies as a framework to increase the effectiveness of management across tropical agricultural lands.'

Abstract: 'An efficient protocol was developed for the rapid in vitro multiplication of an endemic and critically endangered medicinal herb, Ceropegia noorjahaniae Ans., via enhanced axillary bud proliferation from nodal explants. The effects of phytohormones [6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), kinetin (Kin) thidiazuron (TDZ), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)] on in vitro regeneration were investigated. The highest number of shoots (18.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.3), maximum shoot length (10.1\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.8\xc2\xa0cm) and the highest response of shoot induction (95\xc2\xa0%) were recorded on MS medium supplemented with 2.0\xc2\xa0mg/l BAP. Rooting was best achieved on half-strength MS medium augmented with IBA (1.0\xc2\xa0mg/l). Half-strength MS medium supplemented with BAP (4\xc2\xa0mg/l) and sucrose (5\xc2\xa0%, w/v) produced an average of 5.6 flower buds per microshoots with highest (90\xc2\xa0%) flower bud induction response. The plantlets regenerated in vitro with well-developed shoot and roots were successfully established in pots containing sterile sand and coco peat (1:1) and grown in a greenhouse with 85\xc2\xa0% survival rate. The regenerated plants did not show any detectable morphological variation. The developed method can be successfully employed for large-scale multiplication and conservation of C. noorjahaniae.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity of earthworms in tropics is less studied compared to those of the temperate regions. Despite the fact that there have been numerous studies on earthworm diversity in the Western Ghats of India, there still exists scope for more earthworm species which are yet to be described. The present work involves a survey of earthworms in the Nilgiri biosphere reserve (NBR)\xe2\x80\x94a part of a biodiversity hot spot of Western Ghats. Despite being a part of the biodiversity hot spot, studies on earthworm diversity at NBR are very limited. Unless an authentic record of earthworm species is made available, the consequence of human interference, habitat alteration or climate change on the species diversity cannot be assessed. An attempt has been made in this study to conduct a survey of earthworm species available in the selected forest ecosystems of the NBR. The findings of this study have shown that 84.67\xc2\xa0% of the earthworm species identified is native, while the rest are exotic. On the basis of total number of earthworms collected, exotics accounted for 1.55\xc2\xa0%, indicating the predominance of native species in the study area and indicating that this habitat is less disturbed. Among the species identified from Mukurthi, Priodochaeta pellucida is listed as vulnerable and has never been encountered since its discovery about 100\xc2\xa0years ago. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner indices showed that evergreen forests of Silent Valley have a high species diversity as do shola/grasslands of Mukurthi and moist deciduous forests of Muthanga.'

Title: 'Exploring wild genetic resources of Musa acuminata Colla distributed in the humid forests of southern Western Ghats of peninsular India using ISSR markers'

Abstract: ' Musa acuminata ssp. burmannica, one of the wild progenitors contributing \xe2\x80\x98A genome\xe2\x80\x99 to the present-day dessert bananas, has a long evolutionary history intervened by human activities. In this study, ISSR markers were used to analyze the pattern of genetic variation and differentiation in 32 individuals along with two reference samples (viz., Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides, var. Calcutta 4 and Musa balbisiana) of wild Musa, which corresponded to three populations across the biodiversity-rich hot spot of southern Western Ghats of India. High levels of genetic diversity were revealed both at the species and population levels, using Nei\xe2\x80\x99s diversity indices. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed pronounced genetic differentiation, as 96\xc2\xa0% of the total variance was fixed within population and only 4\xc2\xa0% among populations. Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic differentiation coefficient (G ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.1823) and low gene flow (Nm\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.18) further confirmed this. The positive correlation (Mantel test) between geographic distance and genetic distance (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.338 P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) indicates geographic isolation as one of the key factors in shaping the population genetic structure. Grouping of individuals was largely in conformity with their spatial distribution, which was confirmed by UPGMA cluster analysis and PCA scatter plot clustering all 32 individuals into three major groups along a geographical gradient. The discontinuous distribution and dwindling population due to habitat fragmentation are serious threats to prevailing genetic diversity in this species. Conservation measures based on diversity pattern are suggested for long-term preservation and sustainable utilization of this precious genetic resource.'

Abstract: ' Cucumis silentvalleyi (Manilal, T. Sabu et P.J. Mathew) Ghebretinsae et Thulin and Cucumis indicus Ghebretinsae et Thulin are two rare narrow endemics of Western Ghats of India. Both have morphological resemblance but distinguishable by a few key characters like shape of the leaf, ovary and fruit, and chromosome number. While both are edible and non-bitter, their distribution is mutually exclusive, but overlapping with Cucumis sativus var. hardwickii (Royle) Alef. (the wild and feral form of C. sativus L.). Interspecific crossability studies indicate that both are related to each other and to a lesser extent to Cucumis setosus Cogn. and Cucumis melo L. Being incompletely described, a comparative account of their morphology, phenology, distribution, ecology and conservation are provided.'

Title: 'Genetic and clonal diversity of the endemic ant-plant Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae) in the Western Ghats of India'

Abstract: 'Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) is a dominant self-incompatible ant-plant or myrmecophyte, growing as an understorey tree in high-density patches. It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal, characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager\xe2\x80\x99s evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity index (0.1895) as well as of Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (0.1186). In each population, observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected, indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations, grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales. The clonality of H. brunonis may be a factor that contributes to its dominance in Western Ghat forests where it supports a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna.'

Abstract: ' Decalepis arayalpathra popularly used as an effective remedy for peptic ulcer, gastric antisecretory and cancer-like afflictions with an immunomodulatory property. This study was conducted to unravel the chemical composition of the tuberous root and bioactivities of the compounds in the fractions of antioxidant activity by using large-scale multi-targeted approach, which is still unexplored. Methanolic extract (EM) and its sequential fraction (EC: chloroform extract, EEA: ethyl acetate extract, EB: butanol extract, EA: aqueous extract) were used for qualitative and quantitative \nevaluation of phytocompounds present in the tuberous root of the plant. The characterization of 2H4MB and chlorogenic acid by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was also performed with the help of standard compound. The results revealed the extract to be rich in phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, carbohydrate, saponin and alkaloids. EM proved to be a compatible solvent for the extraction and corresponds to maximum numbers of phytocompounds followed by its fraction (EB, EA, EEA and EC). EM, EB and EEA were further subjected for gas chromatography\xe2\x80\x93mass spectrometry (GC\xe2\x80\x93MS) analysis, which revealed the presence of more than 20 different bioactive compounds. The methanolic extract and its successive fractions were also screened for the antioxidant activity using different prototype. 2H4MB and chlorogenic acid quantified by HPLC in methanol extract was 11.22 and 9.67\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml respectively. The reported compound might be responsible for the potent antioxidant property of the plant. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the analysis of the chemical composition and the bioactive potential of the compounds obtained by extract of D. arayalpathra. '

Title: 'Demography and reproductive output in langurs of the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'Life history traits evolve such that the reproductive output of an organism is maximized. Demographic characteristics, a consequence of life history traits, indicate the reproductive output per individual in group-living species. Both phylogenetic and ecological factors influence demographic traits. In the forests of the Western Ghats, India, we studied the demography of three langur species: Semnopithecus johnii, a wet forest-dwelling species; Semnopithecus hypoleucos, largely a wet forest-dwelling species; and Semnopithecus priam, a primarily dry forest-dwelling species. S. hypoleucos and S. priam are genetically closer to each other than to S. johnii. We sampled a total of 193 groups of the three species of langurs. The group size was smaller in the two wet forest-dwelling species, S. johnii (median\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010) and S. hypoleucos (nine), than in the dry forest-dwelling species, S. priam (18). The number of adult females per group was higher in S. priam (seven) and S. johnii (six) than in S. hypoleucos (four). On the other hand, the adult female:immature ratio, indicating reproductive output and life history, was highest in S. johnii (1:0.33) followed by S. hypoleucos (1:1) and S. priam (1:1.09). Our results suggest that reproductive output is lowest in the arboreal wet forest species and increases as the species become somewhat dry deciduous forest dwellers, or almost facultative dry forest dwellers, and relatively more terrestrial. Some traits, such as group size, appear to be more sensitive to ecological factors, and some other traits such as age-sex ratios and reproductive output appear to be more conservative.'

Abstract: ' In northern Western Ghats (India), four tropical habitats with different disturbance levels were monitored for diversity and seasonal patterns in butterfly communities. Species richness was highest in late monsoon and early winter. Majority of the butterfly species also showed abundance peaks in these seasons. Fire played a significant role in determining species composition in fire-afflicted areas and affected flight periods of some species but did not affect species richness. Grazing had a major impact on species composition and it favoured only those Lycaenids and Nymphalids whose caterpillars feed on herbs. In case of one of the sites where phenophases of the larval foodplant and population trend of a small Lycaenid was documented, the population showed rapid increase at the time when the plants were in suitable phenophase for growth of the caterpillars. A possible evolutionary interaction between herb-feeding and non-herb-feeding Lycaenids is proposed.'

Abstract: 'The community ecology of freshwater fishes in four river systems (Sharavati, Aghanashini, Bedti and Kali) of the central Western Ghats (India) has been studied for the first time. Patterns of fish species distributions were analysed and important stream and environmental parameters determining the species richness and composition of this region were identified. Upstream--downstream trends in species richness and diversity as well as changes in stream characteristics were studied using univariate correlation analyses. Preliminary analyses on changes in species composition and feeding guilds showed the presence of a gradual species turnover along the stream gradient. There were associated changes in the major feeding guild compositions, with a higher proportion of insectivore and algivore/herbivore composition in the upper reaches shifting to a predominance of omnivores and carnivores downstream. Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s product--moment correlation analyses along with stepwise multiple regression analyses identified stream depth and altitude as the important parameters determining species richness. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed to study species associations with environmental parameters. The analysis showed a strong species environmental correlation to the CCA axes, a high significance for the CCA axis 1 as well as for the overall test. The plots of the species and site scores on the CCA axes showed a clear segregation of species based on their relations with environmental and stream properties. This study is an important step in our understanding of the community structure of fish species of these rivers and would be helpful in future efforts on the conservation of aquatic communities and their habitats.'

Abstract: 'Abundance and biomass of pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera) and earthworms in the forests and plantations of nine study sites in the southwestern India (Western Ghats, foothill of the Western Ghats and the west coast) were surveyed. Out of 10 morphospecies of pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera) recovered, four were identified, and the rest did not match with morphological and taxonomic descriptions. A maximum of five species of Arthrosphaera were recovered from the Western Ghat forests. In forests, the biomass of pill millipedes was higher than earthworms but lower in abundance. In plantations, both biomass and abundance of millipedes were higher than those of earthworms. None of the 12 soil edaphic features (moisture, bulk density, water-holding capacity, temperature, pH, conductivity, organic carbon, P, K, Ca, Mg and litter depth) significantly correlated with millipede biomass in the Western Ghat forests, nor were any soil features correlated with earthworm biomass in the west coast plantations. While all, except for soil moisture, were significantly correlated with earthworm biomass in the Western Ghat forests. In the Western Ghat plantations, the biomass of millipedes was significantly correlated with soil moisture, pH, organic carbon and minerals (P, K and Ca). In the west coast plantations, the biomass of millipedes was significantly correlated with moisture, water-holding capacity, organic carbon, Ca, and Mg, while, in the foothill plantations, only with temperature.'

Abstract: 'Tropical dry forests and savannas constitute more than half of all tropical forests and grasslands, but little is known about forest fire regimes within these two extensive types of ecosystems. Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest in India, the Nilgiri landscape, and a predominantly savanna ecosystem in the Sathyamangalam landscape, were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr in the Nilgiri landscape and 44.1 yr in the Sathyamangalam landscape. Tree (\xe2\x89\xa510 cm diameter at breast height) species diversity, tree density, and basal area were significantly higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Total fuel loads were significantly higher in tropical dry and moist deciduous forests in the Nilgiri landscape, but total fuel loads were higher in the tropical dry thorn forests of the Sathyamangalam landscape. Thus, the two landscapes revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires in the Nilgiri landscape. The dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations. Understanding the factors maintaining these two ecosystems will be critical for their conservation.'

Abstract: 'The availability of refuges from predators and high quality food are thought to determine habitat use in small ungulates. We tested this hypothesis on habitat use by the Indian chevrotain in a tropical rainforest in the Western Ghats, using pellet-groups to infer habitat use. Between December 2009 and April 2010, we sampled 204 grids of 50\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa050\xc2\xa0m with four spatial replicates in each, using occupancy framework. We quantified refuges such as fallen logs and boulders, understorey complexity, and noted the presence of fruiting trees in the grid. Detection probability, p, of pellet-groups was estimated at 0.61. The naive estimate of occupancy was 0.52, which increased to 0.73 when p was accounted for. Out of eight candidate models compared using AICC, the one with the number of refuges and understorey complexity was the best model. Both covariates had non-zero positive slopes. Fruiting trees occurred very infrequently and did not influence habitat use, perhaps because the chevrotain fed more on buds, shoots and young leaves during the dry period covered by this study. The strong influence of understorey complexity on habitat use was perhaps also due to the abundance of these food items. These results highlight the need to control human use that adversely impacts the availability of refuges and understorey complexity such as removal of fallen logs and rattans. This study also demonstrates the application of the occupancy approach in the study of small and elusive ungulates.'

Abstract: 'A long-standing view of Indian biodiversity is that while rich in species, there are few endemics or in-situ radiations within the subcontinent. One exception is the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, an isolated mountain range with many endemic species. Understanding the origins of the montane-restricted species is crucial to illuminate both taxonomic and environmental history.'

Title: 'Endophytic fungal communities in woody perennials of three tropical forest types of the Western Ghats, southern India'

Abstract: 'Fungal endophytes of tropical trees are expected to be exceptionally species rich as a consequence of high tree diversity in the tropics and the purported host restriction among the endophytes. Based on this premise, endophytes have been regarded as a focal group for estimating fungal numbers because their possible hyperdiverse nature would reflect significantly global fungal diversity. We present our consolidated ten-year work on 75 dicotyledonous tree hosts belonging to 33 families and growing in three different types of tropical forests of the NBR in the Western Ghats, southern India. We conclude that endophyte diversity in these forests is limited due to loose host affiliations among endophytes. Some endophytes have a wide host range and colonize taxonomically disparate hosts suggesting adaptations in them to counter a variety of defense chemicals in their hosts. Furthermore, such polyphagous endophytes dominate the endophyte assemblages of different tree hosts. Individual leaves may be densely colonized but only by a few endophyte species. It appears that the environment (the type of forest in this case) has a larger role in determining the endophyte assemblage of a plant host than the taxonomy of the host plant. Thus, different tropical plant communities have to be studied for their endophyte diversity to test the generalization that endophytes are hyperdiverse in the tropics, estimate their true species richness, and use them as a predictor group for more accurate assessment of global fungal diversity.'

Abstract: 'An efficient protocol has been devised for the propagation and field establishment of Eulophia cullenii (Wight) Bl., a terrestrial orchid having ornamental potentialities, and is critically endangered in Western Ghats, India. Seeds extracted from 60\xe2\x80\x9390-d-old capsules germinated in \xc2\xbd MS, \xc2\xbc MS, Knudson C, or Mitra liquid medium developed into 1.4\xe2\x80\x932.5-mm-diameter protocorms in 60\xc2\xa0d. Supplementation of organic additives like coconut water, peptone, yeast extract, and casein acid hydrolysate (CH) significantly enhanced protocorm growth. Upon subculture onto agar-gelled Mitra medium fortified with 0.05% CH, 56% of protocorms regenerated into shoots through the formation of linear mini-rhizomes. The regenerated shoots grew vigorously in \xc2\xbd MS, producing new rhizomes. Mature rhizomes from axenic seedlings produced maximum (13\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.4) shoots/whole rhizome in \xc2\xbd MS fortified with 44.4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), in 120\xe2\x80\x93150\xc2\xa0d. Horizontal and longitudinal halves of the rhizome also gave multiple shoots (6\xe2\x80\x938.5) in the presence of 44.4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BAP. Shoots or shoot clumps sub-cultured onto \xc2\xbd MS basal medium produced roots followed by rhizomes in 60\xe2\x80\x93150\xc2\xa0d. Seedlings with mature rhizomes showed 70% establishment in the nursery and added a new rhizome at the end of one growth cycle. An average of 70.6% of the rhizomes originating from seedlings during the second growth cycle sprouted to produce new shoots, when planted in the native localities. Asymbiotic germination and cloning through rhizomes thus can provide a large number of vigorous plants of E. cullenii for ornamental exploitation as well as eco-restoration, if rhizome as storage organ is ensured in the propagule.'

Abstract: 'Macro and microhabitat analyses were applied to characterise the fish assemblage structure in 10 streams of the Western Ghat mountains of Peninsular India. Macrohabitat features, such as channel gradient, stream depth, stream width, riparian cover, instream cover, habitat types and substrates, were used. Microhabitat requirements of the abundant cyprinids (35 species) were also analysed. Macrohabitat assessment indicated that a high habitat diversity was associated with a high species diversity, and that habitat volume was a major determining factor for species diversity and abundance. In all streams, cyprinids were the dominant group in the assemblage and almost all cyprinids were confined to pools with a varied habitat diversity. Riffle dwelling species included ancient forms such as Glyptothorax madraspatnum, G. trewasae and Homaloptera santhamparaiensis. Suitable microhabitats for dominant cyprinid species were pools and riffle edges. Big-sized barbs and mahseers such as Hypselobarbus dobsoni, H. curmuca, H. dubius, Labeo calbasu, Puntius sarana, Tor khudree and Tor khudree malabaricus were confined to deep pools with a large area. Smaller Puntius species like P. fasciatus, P. melanampyx, P. narayani, P. sophore, P. ticto and P. vittatus lived in shallow backwater pools and pools with low flow. Species like P. arulius tambiraparniei, P. amphibius, P. bimaculatus and P. filamentosus were found towards shallow pools with moderate flow. Surface-dwelling species such as Danio aequipinnatus, Rasbora daniconius, Salmostoma spp. and Barilius spp. preferred deepwater habitats with high flow. Habitat-based multivariate analysis revealed four guilds: surface dwellers, column dwellers, generalized bottom dwellers and specialized bottom dwellers.'

Abstract: 'We performed desiccation and storage trials to better understand storage behavior of Knema attenuata seeds. Mature seeds with moisture content (MC) of 31% exhibited 73% germination. During the period of desiccation (open lab condition) seeds with MC 23% showed 40% germination. After further drying to MC 21% germination was reduced to 16%. Complete loss in viability resulted when seed moisture was reduced to 18%. The seeds stored at -10\xc2\xb0C, 0\xc2\xb0C, 10\xc2\xb0C and 28\xc2\xb12\xc2\xb0C (open lab condition) lost their viability within 10 days. Seeds stored in sealed polythene bags and moist sand retained viability for more days than did seeds stored under all other storage conditions. Sensitivity of seeds to lower temperature and desiccation suggest that the storage behavior of K. attenuata seeds is recalcitrant. Seeds stored in moist conditions can, at best, be stored for a period of two months.'

Abstract: 'Spatial and temporal trends of invasion by Ochlandra travancorica, a native reed bamboo species were studied. The study was carried out in Agasthyamalai Biosphere reserve, Western Ghats, India. Multi-temporal satellite images from 1973 to 2012 were utilized to map the areas of occurrence of the species. The largest areal extent of the species was calculated to be 111.65\xc2\xa0km2 in the recent time, at which the invasion process reached its saturation phase. The species was found to be a generalist, with no preferred inclination towards any particular topographic or climatic zone. Evergreen forests were established to be its closest associate with largest area followed by semi evergreen and moist deciduous forests within buffer distances of 100, 200 and 500\xc2\xa0m. A threatening 20.8\xc2\xa0% of evergreen forests were revealed to have been converted to pure reed bamboos. Overlay analysis showed the oldest and the newest surviving patches of pure reed bamboos in the landscape of Agasthyamalai. The study realizes the significance of remote sensing and GIS in mapping and monitoring of invasive species. We suggest periodical monitoring of reed bamboo areas to check its growth, spread and establishment in order to ensure conservation of Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'Habitat fragmentation is postulated to be a major factor influencing infectious disease dynamics in wildlife populations and may also be responsible, at least in part, for the recent spurt in the emergence, or re-emergence, of infectious diseases in humans. The mechanism behind these relationships are poorly understood due to the lack of insights into the interacting local factors and insufficient baseline data in ecological parasitology of wildlife. Here, we studied the gastrointestinal parasites of nonhuman mammalian hosts living in 10 rainforest patches of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, India. We examined 349 faecal samples of 17 mammalian species and successfully identified 24 gastrointestinal parasite taxa including 1 protozoan, 2 trematode, 3 cestode and 18 nematode taxa. Twenty of these parasites are known parasites of humans. We also found that as much as 73% of all infected samples were infected by multiple parasites. In addition, the smallest and most fragmented forest patches recorded the highest parasite richness; the pattern across fragments, however, seemed to be less straightforward, suggesting potential interplay of local factors.'

Abstract: 'Phenological studies help to analyze resource abundance and feeding ecology of some herbivorous primate species. The rainforest between the rivers Aghnashini and Sharavathy in Karnataka, India, is one of the richest primate habitats in the country. Plant resource availability was studied in this forest using belt transect and plot methods. More than 800 trees of 71 species were considered for phenology sampling, and the tree species used by primates for consumption of leaves, flowers and fruits were selected for availability monitoring. Flush leaves were available throughout the year. The availability of mature leaves and flowers was highest in pre-summer (December\xe2\x80\x93February). Unripe and ripe fruits were mostly available in summer (March\xe2\x80\x93May). The availability of these resources showed significant seasonal variation. The availability and abundance of plant food resources throughout the year, presence of keystone species and broad food niches probably account for the presence of a high density of primates including 32, 47 and 151 groups of lion-tailed macaques, bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs respectively in about 200\xc2\xa0km2 of this forest making this region a model for primate conservation.'

Abstract: 'Tree diversity (\xe2\x89\xa530 cm gbh) in undisturbed and human-impacted tropical evergreen forest sites was investigated in the Kolli hills, Eastern Ghats, India. Four 2-ha contiguous permanent plots were erected, one each in Perumakkai shola (site PS), Vengodai shola (VS), Kuzhivalavu shola (KS) and Mottukkadu shola (MS) at 1000, 1050, 1200 and 1250 m elevation, with increasing human disturbance, to evaluate the difference in tree species composition, stand structure and dynamics. This paper discusses the results of the first survey. A total of 3825 individuals and 78 species from 61 genera and 36 families were enumerated in the 8 ha area. Among the four 2-ha sites, species richness was greatest (58) in the undisturbed site PS and lowest (39) in the highly disturbed site MS. Shannon, Simpson, Hill diversity and evenness indexes revealed a progressive reduction in diversity with increasing disturbance. The asymptote species-area curves imply adequate site sampling. Tree density (1151 to 651 trees ha\xe2\x88\x922) and basal area (106 to 46.6 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x922) decreased from undisturbed to disturbed site, due to selective felling. Single species, Memecylon umbellatum dominated sites MS (39%) and VS (26%), while Nothopegia heyneana, Memecylon umbellatum and Diospyros ovalifolia were dominant in PS, and Meliosma simplicifolia, Myristica dactyloides and Phoebe wightii in KS. Based on species abundance, we classify the study area as Memecylon\xe2\x80\x93Phoebe\xe2\x80\x93Beilschmiedia association with Neolitsea and Myristica as codominants. Tree population structure revealed a step-wise decline in girth frequencies with increasing size class in undisturbed site PS, whereas tree density fell sharp (>50%) in medium girth class in the disturbed site MS. Population of the dominant species varied widely. The diversity values of this inventory are compared with similar studies in India and other tropical forests. Evidently, the reduction in species richness (by 52%), basal area (56%) and tree density (58%) in disturbed sites, with 57.6% of species rarity of this tropical evergreen forest, in secluded patches (\xe2\x80\x98sholas\xe2\x80\x99) of Kolli hills, underlines conservation need to prevent species loss.'

Abstract: 'Studies on the effects of tropical rainforest fragmentation and disturbance have often focussed on plants and vertebrates such as birds and mammals and seldom on invertebrates, despite the latter being among the most biologically diverse groups in these ecosystems. Spiders are one such group of invertebrate predators that are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change in tropical ecosystems. The present study assesses the spider community structure and responses to rainforest fragmentation and degradation and conversion to shade-coffee plantations in the Anamalai hills, southern Western Ghats, India. Ten rainforest fragments ranging in size from 11\xc2\xa0ha to 2,600\xc2\xa0ha under varying levels of degradation within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and private lands of the Valparai plateau, and two shade-coffee plantation sites were sampled for spiders using visual searches along time-constrained belt transects between January and May 2005. Within a total sampled area of 5.76\xc2\xa0ha, 4,565 individual spiders (4,300 detections) belonging to 156 morphospecies within 21 families and 8 functional groups were recorded. The estimated total number of understorey spider species in the study area was 192 (\xc2\xb15.15\xc2\xa0SD) species, representing around 13% of the total number of spider species so far described from India. Overall spider density, species richness, and species density showed no trend in relation to fragment area across all sites. Specific comparisons among undisturbed sites indicated however that high altitude sites had fewer species than mid-altitude sites and fragments had fewer species than relatively larger continuous forest sites. In contrast to the lack of trend in overall species richness and abundance, species composition changed substantially in relation to habitat alteration and altitude. Cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarities among sites in spider species composition revealed four distinct clusters: high altitude undisturbed sites, mid-altitude disturbed sites with an undisturbed mid altitude site, mid-altitude highly disturbed sites with a disturbed site, and shade-coffee plantation sites. Spider species, such as Psechrus torvus and Tylorida culta, that contributed significantly to the dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed rainforest sites, and rainforest and shade-coffee sites were identified that serve as useful indicators of habitat alteration.'

Abstract: 'Regulation of streamflow by a reservoir creates a flow regime much different from the pre-impoundment period flow regime. Hydro-Electric Projects (HEPs) commissioned in the Western Ghat regions of the Kerala State, India during the last four decades caused considerable changes in the flow regimes of the rivers of the Kerala State in southwest India. In this paper, the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) approach proposed by Richter et al. (1996) is used to analyze flow regime changes in the Periyar and Muvattupuzha Rivers, due to the construction of the Idukki (1976), Idamalayar (1987) and Lower Periyar (1997) HEPs in the high ranges of the Western Ghats. Normal rainfall years (annual rainfall values within mean \xc2\xb1 0.75 standard deviation limits) are only considered in the analysis to focus on hydrologic alterations due to human activities. The mean hydrologic alteration in the Periyar River (deviation from the pre-development hydrologic indicator values) after commissioning of three HEPs is 35%. Inter-basin water transfer after power generation from the Idukki HEP resulted in a higher discharge in the adjacent Muvattupuzha River, leading to considerable changes in the hydro-environment (mean hydrologic alterations varying between 57 to 63%). IHA parameters showing hydrologic alterations above the 67th Percentile were further analyzed. For each of the pre-construction hydrologic parameters \xc2\xb1 1 standard deviation from the mean is set as the upper and lower management target limits. The values of each IHA parameter beyond these targets are considered as non-attainment. Considerable hydrologic alterations are observed, especially for low flows in both basins. Inter-basin transfer induced larger changes in flow parameters compared to intra-basin regulations. The study shows that under a proper water release and diversion scheme, the non-attainment of IHA parameters (values fall beyond the target limits) can be reduced. The findings of the study will be greatly beneficial to regional water management and restoration of an eco-environmental system in the humid tropical region.'

Abstract: 'Vigna khandalensis (Santapau) Raghavan et Wadhwa, is an endemic legume belonging to subgenus Ceratotropis (Asian Vigna), genus Vigna of the family Fabaceae. It is commonly known as \xe2\x80\x98Ranmung\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Jungli mung\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Badamung\xe2\x80\x99. V. khandalensis is sporadically distributed at high altitude areas in the Northern Western Ghats, India. It is an annual, erect, tall herb growing along roadsides, hilly slopes, pond sides and near human settlements. The legume seeds are utilized by human beings at the time of famine. Surprisingly, the plant remains neglected and underutilized although its high nutritional value. The scant information on V. khandalensis leads us to investigate this underexploited and underutilized legume as a food source for human. The present paper deals with geographical distribution, taxonomy, ecology, agro-morphological characterization, nutritional content and phytochemical analysis. The results obtained in the present investigation provide information on agro-morphological traits and nutritional potential of V. khandalensis. Furthermore, it is promoted as a legume \xe2\x80\x98Crop for the Future\xe2\x80\x99 for food security.'

Abstract: 'The objective of this study is to present a methodological approach to assess the inherent vulnerability of forests and apply it to a case study. Addressing inherent vulnerability, resulting from current stresses, is a necessary step for building resilience to long-term climate change. The proposed approach includes use of analytical framework that enables selection of vulnerability criteria and indicators systematically, application of pairwise comparison method (PCM) for assigning weights, and synthesis of a composite vulnerability index. This methodological approach has been applied at local scale to Aduvalli Protected Forest in Western Ghats in South India, where a vulnerability index value of 0.248 is estimated. Results of the case study indicate that \xe2\x80\x98preponderance of invasive species\xe2\x80\x99 and forest dependence of community are the major sources of vulnerability at present for Aduvalli Protected Forest. Adoption of this methodology can assist in development of forest management plans to enhance adaptability of Aduvalli PF to current as well as future stresses, including climate change. This methodological approach can be applied across forest-types after appropriate changes to criteria and indicators and their weights, to estimate the inherent vulnerability to enable development of adaptation strategy.'

Abstract: 'Carbon stock distribution in the protected areas (PAs) of India is rarely studied, although they constitute 21.34% of the geographical area under forest cover. A quantitative assessment of ecosystem service is used here to evaluate the PAs of India in terms of storage and spatial distribution of carbon stocks. The area selected for the study was Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR), in the Southern Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site. Carbon storage on a land parcel largely depends on the amount of five carbon pools: aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic matter. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model uses land cover types and data on the stocks in the five carbon pools to estimate the amount of carbon stored in a landscape. The InVEST model is multiservice and has a modular design that provides an effective tool for exploring the likely outcomes of alternative management and climate scenarios and for evaluating trade-offs among sectors and services. The results showed that the average carbon (C) stock in the study area was 76\xc2\xa0t/ha, and a sum of 15.43 million tons were stored in PTR. The multiservice, modular design of the ecosystem service analysis provides decision-makers an effective tool for evaluating and managing natural resources.'

Abstract: 'This paper introduces a new statistical method that we recommend should become standard procedure to quantify the goodness-of-fit of calibration and validation for land-use change models. We present a multiple-resolution Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) that measures the goodness-of-fit between a reference map, which is considered reality, and a simulated map, which is a model\xe2\x80\x99s output. This proposed ROC is based on: (1) multiple-resolutions, (2) soft classification, (3) sampling without replacement, and 4) explicit separation of factors of quantity versus location of land-use change. We illustrate the method with a case study in India\xe2\x80\x99s Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot, where we have maps of cumulative forest disturbance for 1920 and 1990. We use a predictive modeling approach similar to GEOMOD in which we calibrate the model with the map of 1920, then predict the map of 1990, at which point we subject the model to validation. We show that the fit of calibration tends to be much larger than the fit of validation. Thus if a modeler assess a model by goodness-of-fit of calibration only, then the modeler will likely be over confident in the model\xe2\x80\x99s predictive ability.'

Abstract: 'The distribution and availability of food was examined to see how it influenced ranging patterns and sleeping site selection in a group of lion-tailed macaques. The home range and core area were 130.48\xc2\xa0ha (95\xc2\xa0% kernel) and 26.68\xc2\xa0ha (50\xc2\xa0% kernel) respectively. The lion-tailed macaques had a longer day range, had a greater number of sleeping sites and used more core areas in the summer as compared to the monsoon and the post-monsoon seasons. The ranging patterns and sleeping site use were influenced by the major food resources used in a particular season. The ranging was mainly influenced by Artocarpus heterophyllus in monsoon, Cullenia exarillata and Toona ciliata in post- monsoon, and Artocarpus heterophyllus and Ficus amplissima in summer. The distribution of these four plant species is, therefore, critical to ranging, and thus to conservation of the lion-tailed macaque.'

Abstract: 'Parental care has evolved many times in multiple taxa and, by definition, enhances offspring survivorship. Anurans exhibit a diverse array of parental care behaviors, but studies examining their adaptive significance in an evolutionary context are limited. The critically endangered bush frog, Raorchestes chalazodes (Rhacophoridae), only breeds inside hollow internodes of the endemic bamboo (Ochlandra travancorica) in the southern Western Ghats of India from June through October. From systematic surveys, we established that adult males are sole caregivers exhibiting egg attendance and egg guarding behavior. Predation was the main cause of egg mortality in the absence of an attending male; the majority of predation events were caused by conspecific males. The results highlight the role of regional and microhabitat-specific selection pressures such as strong seasonality, limited resources, and competition for oviposition sites. Oviposition sites are in high demand, but in short supply and by consuming unattended eggs, the conspecific male may benefit from nutritional gains as well as mating opportunities at the oviposition site. Our work lays foundations for further examination of social and reproductive behaviors of anurans not only in the Western Ghats but also in South and Southeast Asia.'

Abstract: 'We used standard isolation protocols to explore the endophytic fungal communities in three tissue types of two dominant orchids (Bulbophyllum neilgherrense and Vanda testacea) of the Kaiga forest of the Western Ghats. We surface sterilized and assessed 90 segments of each orchid for the occurrence and diversity of endophytic fungal taxa. The 118 fungal isolates were obtained from root, bulb and leaves of B. neilgherrense, consisting of 17 anamorphic taxa (range, 10\xe2\x80\x9315 taxa) with 1.3 fungal taxa per segment (range, 1.2\xe2\x80\x931.4 taxa). Four taxa (Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Penicillium sp. and morpho sp. 1) belonged to the core group (11.1%\xe2\x80\x9332.2%). The relative abundance of A. flavus and morpho sp. 1 was more than 10%. A total of 130 fungal isolates from roots, stems and leaves of V. testacea yielded 20 anamorphic taxa (range, 11\xe2\x80\x9315 taxa) with 1.4 fungal taxa per segment (range, 1.4\xe2\x80\x931.5 taxa). Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, Gliocladium viride, Penicillium sp. and morpho sp. 1 belonged to the core group. Relative abundance exceeded 10% for A. flavus, A. niger, and morpho sp. 1. The Simpson and Shannon diversity indices were higher in leaf than root or bulb/stem of both orchids. Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s similarity coefficient was higher between root and leaf in both orchids (56.3%-60%) than between other pairs. Our study revealed that the endophytic fungal assemblage and diversity of B. neilgherrense and V. testacea of Kaiga forest of the Western Ghats were relatively similar between orchids and their tissues.'

Abstract: 'We assessed soil fungal diversity in the dry deciduous forest of a Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary of the Western Ghats (210.31 m a.s.l.; N 13\xc2\xb044\xe2\x80\xb2 and E75\xc2\xb037\xe2\x80\xb2). Soil samples were collected by random mixed sampling during winter (November, 2008), summer (March, 2009) and monsoon (August, 2009) seasons, and physico-chemical parameters were recorded. During winter, summer, and monsoon seasons, 49, 45 and 49 of fungal species belongs to 20, 18 and 19 of genera were isolated, respectively. Isolated soil fungi were mainly of the Mitosporic fungi, followed by Zygomycotina, Ascomycotina, Oomycotina and Coelomycetes. Indices of diversity, dominance and fisher alpha during winter, summer and monsoon seasons were 3.756, 3.638 and 3.738 (H\xe2\x80\xb2), 0.9737, 0.9694 and 0.9726 (1-D) and 18.84, 29.83 and 19.46 (\xce\xb1), respectively. Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s (r) correlation coefficient of fungal population with physico-chemical parameters of soils showed significantly positive and negative correlations (p<0.01) during winter, summer and monsoon seasons. Physico-chemical soil parameters played an important role in the occurrence, diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of fungal species in the tropical dry deciduous forest soil.'

Abstract: 'Pot experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of three arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi viz. Glomus fasciculatum, Funneliformis mosseae and Acaulospora laevis\non the growth of Vatica chinensis. Plants grown in the presence of AM fungi generally showed an increase in growth and biomass over those grown in the absence of AM fungal inoculation. It was observed that a consortium of AM fungi without organic manure was found to be the best treatment to enhance plant biomass. The plant height, number of leaves and plant dry and fresh matter, plant P and N contents varied significantly with treatments. The AM colonization was higher in the seedling roots inoculated with two or three AM fungi. This study indicated that the inoculation with AM fungi either alone or in combination improved the growth, biomass yield and phosphorus nutrition of V. chinensis compared to that of the control. This information may be helpful to improve the growth of these species in sustainable forestry program.'

Abstract: 'Nutrient composition of the manure of four pill millipedes (Arthrosphaera dalyi, A. davisoni, A. fumosa and A. magna) inhabiting in semi-evergreen forests and plantations of the Western Ghats of Southwest India was evaluated. The quantity and quality of fecal pellets differed between millipedes and their habitats (forest and plantation). Organic carbon content in manure was lower in plantations than in forests, while nitrogen content was elevated in plantations. The carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of manure was lower in plantations compared to forests. The phosphorus content in manure was elevated in plantations in all except for A. dalyi. Calcium content of manure was increased in plantations than in forests. The contents of magnesium, potassium and phenolics in manure showed varied results. The mass of fecal pellets was correlated only with volume in forests (r=0.882; p < 0.01) and pH in plantations (r=0.616; p < 0.05), while the volume of fecal pellets was correlated with nitrogen content in forests (r=0.751; p < 0.01) and calcium in plantations (r=\xe2\x88\x920.619; p < 0.05). The conductivity was positively correlated with phosphorus and potassium, while magnesium was negatively correlated in forests as well as plantations. Potassium and magnesium were negatively correlated in forests (r=\xe2\x88\x920.920; p < 0.001) and plantations (r=0.692; p < 0.05). Overall, the physicochemical characteristics and nutrient composition of fecal pelets differed between millipedes as well as habitats. The low carbon to nitrogen ratio and the increased nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium content in the manure of millipedes inhabiting in plantations indicates possibilities for successfully employing them for in situ composting of forest or plantation residues.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats (India) is a region of high biological diversity and endemicity of terrestrial fauna, but very little is known about its freshwater species distributions. Four rivers, Sharavati, Aghanashini, Bedti and Kali, of the central Western Ghats were studied for their fish diversity and composition. A total species richness of 92 species (and an endemicity of 25%) was reported. A comparison of expected species richness (SR) estimates using different statistical estimators was made \xe2\x80\x93 these showed the expected SR to be in the range of 92\xe2\x80\x93120 species. Many of the species were found to be shared with those belonging to the southern Western Ghats, but the study also unearthed new findings in terms of description of a new species and extension of the known distribution range of some of the species. The study at varying spatial and temporal scales also showed that while the rivers are very similar to each other in terms of the SR values, they do vary with respect to the species composition. Species compositions across upper (or lower) reaches of these rivers were found to be more similar to one another than the upstream and downstream reaches in the same river. Temporal patterns, with regard to diurnal activity of fishes were studied. These showed that of the 72 species collected at night, 29 were exclusive to night sampling. Though much of the information of the feeding and habitat preferences of the fishes in this region is lacking, it is speculated that the differences in their activity patterns could be related to feeding and predator avoidance.'

Abstract: 'Diurnal periodicity of abundance (total, male and female) and behavior (resting, feeding and croaking) of the frogs Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis, E. hexadactylus and Hoplobatrachus tigerinus inhabiting in ponds of the Western Ghats at different altitudes (high, mid and foothill) have been investigated during three seasons (monsoon, post-monsoon and summer). Irrespective of seasons, the air and water temperatures were significantly lower during night than day in all locations (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) and the humidity was significantly higher in high-altitude (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) than other locations. Total abundance was significantly high only during night in mid-altitude inhabiting frog E. hexadactylus (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). The resting behavior was significantly lower during night than day in all frogs, while it was opposite for croaking behavior. The feeding behavior was significantly higher during day than night in E. cyanophlyctis (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). Total abundance was significantly correlated with abundance of females. Three hourly observations up to 24\xc2\xa0h revealed consistently high total as well as female abundance during monsoon than other seasons. The resting and feeding behaviors of frogs gradually decreased from day towards night, while croaking behavior gradually increased from 5\xc2\xa0pm onwards and reached a peak at 8\xc2\xa0pm and decreased further. Studies on the influence of environmental variables on the behavior of frogs in their native/natural habitats and in mesocosms will be rewarding to follow up their rehabilitation and conservation.'

Abstract: ' Mating behaviour of four species of pill-millipedes under genus Arthrosphaera Pocock (Arthrosphaera dalyi Pocock and Arthrosphaera disticta Pocock, Arthrosphaera fumosa Pocock and Arthrosphaera magna Attems) endemic to the Western Ghats of Southern India was analyzed in mesocosms. Stridulation is a classical communication signal in males as well as females for mate selection. Conglobation (or volvation) is a mechanism of defence to protect from disturbance or avoid predation. If male touches female or vice versa they conglobate. To avoid disparity among individuals of the same species, volvating pill-millipedes evolved stridulation behaviour for communication. The male broadcasts appropriate signal to female through stridulation to advertise its interest in mating. The females test the male\xe2\x80\x99s fitness by conglobation and suitable male uncoils the partner through stridulation signals. Male with its pygidium successfully uncoils the female and attains suitable orientation for courtship. Male pairs with female ventro\xe2\x80\x93ventro contact in opposite direction to deposit sperm into the vulva of female. The duration of mating varies from species to species and usually a lapse from 3 to 30\xc2\xa0min. Vibration generated by stridulation is species-specific and its perception mechanism in pill-millipedes is yet to be clearly understood. Present study emphasized the structure of stridulatory organs, mechanism of stridulation and pattern of mating behaviour in four species of pill-millipedes.'

Abstract: 'The changes in species composition, abundance and forest stand structure were analyzed across altitudinal regimes in tropical forests of Eastern Ghats of northern Andhra Pradesh, India. Three 1-ha plots were established with one each in low, medium and high altitudes. A total of 153 species, 2129 stems (709 stems \xc2\xb7 ha\xe2\x88\x921) of \xe2\x89\xa510 cm girth were enumerated. Species richness and diversity pattern varied along altitudinal gradient and increased with the altitude. Species richness varied from 52 to 110 species\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and stand density from 639 to 836 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 with average basal area of 34.39 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921. Shannon-Wiener index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) ranged from 4.55 to 5.17. Low altitude (i.e., Site 1) is dominated by Xylia xylocarpa (59.22) and Lagerstroemia parviflora (23.90), medium altitude (i.e., Site 2) by Xylia xylocarpa (45.50) Bursera serrata (17.29), and high altitude (i.e., Site 3) has Schleichera oleosa (28.25) Pterocarpus marsupium (26.55) as predominant species. Taxonomically, Rubiaceae (12 species), Fabaceae (12), Euphorbiaceae (11), Rutaceae (7) and Lauraceae (7) were dominant families. Density-wise, Fabaceae, Combretaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Anacardiaceae and Myrtaceae were abundant. Thus, conservation assessment based on altitudinal regimes and the information on species structure and function can provide baseline information for monitoring and sustaining the biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Even since Linnaeus, naturalists and taxonomists have been systematically describing species new to science. Besides indicating gaps in taxonomic effort, understanding the temporal patterns of species discovery could help in identifying drivers that determine discovery. In this study we report the patterns of discovery of eight taxa \xe2\x80\x94 birds, butterflies, frogs, tiger beetles, grasses, asters, ferns and orchids \xe2\x80\x94 in the Western Ghats, a megadiversity centre in India. Our results indicate that the discovery curves for birds and butterflies have been saturated while those for frogs and grasses continue to increase. Within each taxon, the major drivers of discovery were commonness of the species and their size. The average years taken for discovery across taxa were directly related to the per cent endemicity and species richness of the taxa. We discuss the trajectories of discovery with respect to rarity or endemicity of the species and life history features, and the implications these might have for strategizing the discovery process in India.'

Abstract: 'Caecilians are legless amphibians quite characteristic of the Western Ghats. Fourteen out of 16 Indian species occur in the Western Ghats and all are endemic. The present paper deals with the biology of caecilians with reference to external morphology and general breeding behaviour. It consolidates information on 26 morphological parameters which are used in caecilian identification. Metric multidimensional scaling of 16 species of caecilians using pair-wise euclidian distances calculated on the basis of 11 important morphometric parameters clearly depicts morphological distances between different species and more so the genera, thereby validating the classification. A field guide has been developed for the identification of caecilians based on a survey made all over the Western Ghats, observation of holotypes at the Natural History Museum, London and review of the literature. The study also reveals the microhabitat requirements of the caecilians. Further, the localities of caecilian distribution in the Western Ghats are mapped. The taxonomy of Indian caecilians is discussed.'

Abstract: 'There are no comprehensive reports available on impact of shaded and un-shaded coffee agrosystems on soil biology and microbiological processes. The present study compared the changes in soil biological and microbiological attributes along with coffee quality under different levels of shade and elevation for coffee in India. Significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) higher bulk density was observed in low elevation with open patch/no shade (LEOP) as compared to high elevation with thick shade (HETS). Low elevation with thick shade (LETS) recorded significantly higher water holding capacity (55.47\xc2\xa0%) as compared to high elevation with open patch (HEOP) (44.3\xc2\xa0%). Significantly higher organic carbon was observed in samples from shaded area (1.52\xc2\xa0%) as compared to no shade (0.9\xc2\xa0%). As compared to low elevation, higher available nitrogen (376\xc2\xa0kg/ha), available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium content was found to be significantly higher in samples of high elevation. Significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) higher soil respiration rate and urease activity was observed in the treatment LEOP, whereas higher dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate activity were indicated in HETS and HEOP treatments respectively. High elevation with thick or no shade treatments indicated significantly higher soil micro and macro-fauna population as compared to low elevation with thick or no shade. Significantly higher microbial population was recorded in HETS followed by LETS, whereas Shannon diversity index (H\xe2\x80\xb2), Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s dominance index (D), and Shannon evenness (SE) were found to be similar for HETS, HEOP, and LETS treatments. Better cup characteristics were observed with coffee grown at HETS in comparison with low elevation grown coffee.'

Abstract: ' Artocarpus altilis (Park.) Fosberg is an important fruit vegetable tree grown in the homesteads of southern part of India. To provide reasoned scientific management practices and conservation measures, the pattern of morphological and genetic variation were investigated for six populations using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers and 15 morphological traits. The use of five selective primer combinations on 60 samples resulted a total of 414 bands in which 85% were polymorphic. The values of Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic distance varied from 0.0044 (Palai\xe2\x80\x93Palghat) to 0.3376 (Palghat\xe2\x80\x93Mangalore). Analysis of molecular variance revealed most of the variation within populations (57.45%) than (42.55%) among populations. The genetic variation by AFLP data is not reflected in quantitative morphological variables. However, the genetic and geographical distances were positively correlated which were further well supported by the PCO analysis and Dollo-parsimony tree, both show the tendency of the individuals to group according to the geographical localities.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing offers fast and reliable technique to map the variation in plant diversity and distribution at different scales. Using 891 geo-tagged ground sampled point collected for the Western Ghats, India from a national level study on biodiversity characterization. We analyzed the distribution of plant species with respect to the satellite derived vegetation indices. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived vegetation products, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), and surface reflectance (SR-645nm and SR-858nm) were fitted to suitable regression curves with respect to plant species richness where NDVI demonstrated the best fit (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.07); while fPAR showed (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.08) better relation with woody species richness. We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests. Utility of fine resolution spatio-temporal data could render better understanding of species richness pattern using biophysical proxies, and thereby, help in long-term biodiversity monitoring.'

Abstract: ' A survey of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) status of plants growing in the Western Ghats region of Southern India was undertaken. Root and soil samples of plants growing in the four vegetation types forest, grassland, scrub, and cultivated land or plantation were examined. Of the 329 species (representing 61 families) examined, 174 were mycorrhizal. AM association was recorded in 81 species for the first time, including species from several families assumed to be non-mycorrhizal, e.g. Amaranthaceae, Capparaceae, Commelinaceae, Cyperaceae and Portulacaceae. AM fungal spores of 35 species belonging to Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis and Scutellospora were recorded. AM fungal species richness was found to be highest in scrub and lowest in agricultural and plantation soils. Mean colonization levels were dependent on plant life-form, life-cycle pattern and vegetation type.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats form a major mountain belt, next to the Himalayas, in controlling the flux of water and carbon to the northern Indian Ocean. This study attempts to understand the water and carbon cycles in two humid tropical river basins with its streams originating at higher altitudes of the Western Ghats, India. Water and suspended particulate matter (SPM) were collected on a monthly scale during summer monsoon season (June-September) from Swarna and Nethravati rivers draining into the Arabian Sea. For the source apportionment, samples have been measured for stable isotopes of oxygen (\xce\xb418O) and hydrogen (\xce\xb42H) in water and stable isotopes of carbon (\xce\xb413CPOC) in particulate organic matter (POM) at spatial scale from tributaries and main channel of rivers, and runoff water from agricultural land (dominant paddy field) and forest in the downstream region. The association between \xce\xb418O and deuterium-excess in river water and rain water shows that water in these tropical basins depicts rainout effect of marine source moisture during the onset of summer monsoon. As the monsoon intensifies, the fresher rain water replenishes older water stored previously in sub surface soil layer leading to its flushing into the river during summer monsoon season. Stable carbon isotope ratio and elemental ratio of POM (\xce\xb413CPOC = -27.1 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xe2\x80\xb0 and C/N = 8.1 \xc2\xb1 1.7) in two humid tropical river water during summer monsoon season is an admixture of suspended particulates from runoff water of forest (\xce\xb413CPOC = - 27.82 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xe2\x80\xb0) and agricultural land (\xce\xb413CPOC = -26.29 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xe2\x80\xb0). It is found that \xce\xb413CPOC shows minimal variability with SPM content and C/N ratio within the same organic carbon pool. The study emphasizes the need to consider the agricultural runoff contribution to the rivers while establishing the global elemental budget and observing the global climate change.'

Abstract: 'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is a popular hardwood species native to South and South-East Asia. The possible association of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker with morphological variables of eleven important characters viz. girth at breast height (GBH), height of tree, bole height, branch knots, presence of fluting, spiral stem, leaf hair, leaf length/breadth ratio, branching pattern, bark colour and petiole shape for nine natural populations comprising 180 genotypes of teak (9 populations \xc3\x97 20 trees). The phenogram constructed using Euclidean distances for the eleven morphological characters showed that the populations were not grouped according to their geographical origin. The Mantel\xe2\x80\x99s test for pairwise correlation between Euclidean distances of different morphological variables and genetic distances from AFLP data revealed that only petiole character (r =0.269; p =0.046) and height of tree (r =0.200; p =0.001) were significantly correlated with that of AFLP data matrix. The nine populations in this study covered a geographic area of about 1000 km stretch along the Western Ghat of South India. A test of correlation between genetic and geographic distance matrices revealed a significant positive correlation (r =0.475; p =0.009). The lack of perfect congruence between morphological and molecular data except for geographic distance, tree height and petiole character suggested that the morphological system might be useful for the morphotypes management but not appropriate to study the genetic structure of the teak populations.'

Abstract: 'A morphometric analysis was carried out to describe the topography and drainage characteristics of Papanasam and Manimuthar watersheds. These watersheds are part of Western Ghats, which is an ecologically sensitive region. The drainage areas of Papanasam and Manimuthar watersheds are 163 and 211\xc2\xa0km2, respectively and they show patterns of dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage. The slope of both watersheds varied from 0\xc2\xb0 to 59\xc2\xb0 and 0\xc2\xb0 to 55\xc2\xb0, respectively. Moreover, the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. Each watershed was classified as a fifth-order drainage basin. The stream order of the basin was predominantly controlled by physiographic and structural conditions. The increase in stream length ratio from lower to higher order suggests that the study area has reached a mature geomorphic stage. The development of stream segments is affected by rainfall and local lithology of the watersheds.'

Title: 'Dominance hierarchy and social grooming in female lion- tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) in the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'This article reports the structure of dominance and its relationship with social grooming in wild lion-tailed macaque females. The strength of dominance hierarchy was 0.79 on a scale of 0 to 1 indicating a moderate linearity in the ranking system. Dominance scores were converted into an ordinal as well as an interval scale. Grooming scores were also converted into interval scales using standard scores. Grooming received and grooming given correlated positively and negatively respectively with dominance ranks indicating that high ranking females received more and gave less grooming. Grooming was also positively related to encounter rates for dyads of females. More grooming among adjacent ranks, and grooming being more reciprocal, occurred only in the case of dominant females. The grooming patterns, therefore, appeared to be more of despotic than egalitarian nature. While ranking macaques into different Grades of social systems ranging from despotic to egalitarian, Thierry (2004) has placed lion-tailed macaques in Grade 3 corresponding to the \xe2\x80\x98relaxed\xe2\x80\x99 social system. Our results indicate that the grooming and dominance relationships in this species are more despotic, and hence, the Grade for this species requires to be shifted toward 2 or 1.'

Abstract: 'The objective of this study is to apply and test a simple parametric water balance model for prediction of soil moisture regime in the presence of vegetation. The intention was to evaluate the differences in model parameterization and performance when applied to small watersheds under three different types of land covers (Acacia, degraded forest and natural forest). The watersheds selected for this purpose are located in the sub-humid climate within the Western Ghats, Karnataka, India. Model calibration and validation were performed using a dataset comprising depth-averaged soil moisture content measurements made at weekly time steps from October 2004 to December 2008. In addition to this, a sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to the water-holding capacity of the soils with the aim of explaining the suitability and adaptation of exotic vegetation types under the prevailing climatic conditions. Results indicated reasonably good performance of the model in simulating the pattern and magnitude of weekly average soil moisture content in 150\xc2\xa0cm deep soil layer under all three land covers. This study demonstrates that a simple, robust and parametrically parsimonious model is capable of simulating the temporal dynamics of soil moisture content under distinctly different land covers. Also, results of sensitivity analysis revealed that exotic plant species such as Acacia have adapted themselves effectively to the local climate.'

Abstract: 'Thirty-six medicinal plant species belonging to 25 families were surveyed to study Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity from different localities of North and South Goa of Western Ghats, Goa region, India. A total of 30 medicinal plant species were found to be mycorrhizal and six plant species showed absence of AM fungal colonization. Forty two AM fungal species belonging to five genera viz., Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Gigaspora and Ambispora were recovered from the rhizosphere soil. Glomus was found to be the most dominant genera in the study sites, and Glomus fasciculatum the most dominant AM fungal species. Negative significant correlation was observed between percent colonization and spore density. Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s and Shannon Weiner diversity index studies carried out in North and South Goa exhibited less variation in both the sites, indicating a stable and a diverse plant community.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats, the bold westerly escarpment of India paralleling the west coast, are characterized by different geologic and geomorphic units formed during different episodes of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s history. The majority of these present day landforms evolved in response to the tectonic activity that the Western Ghats witnessed during the Tertiary period. The major structural features together with the geomorphic units have predominant role in the occurrence of cataclysmic landslides which the windward slope of Western Ghats witness during the peak monsoon season. The Kerala and Periyar lineaments, which are the sites of minor earthquakes, pass through the study area. Escarpments and structural hill systems are the vulnerable landforms for landslide occurrence. Due to the predominant role of these tectonic and geomorphic features in the capricious change of landforms, a study was carried out in this hilly terrain based on geomorphology. The study of soil, slope morphometry, relative relief, land use/land cover and hydrogeological conditions together with a multidimensional analysis in a GIS environment resulted in classifying the entire area into different landslide susceptible zones based on Bureau of Indian Standards. Moreover, the area is also divided into three zones based on the terrain conditions and the type of landslide occurrence. The methodology can well fit with any area experiencing the same terrain conditions and can be used to classify an area on the basis of landslide occurrence and geomorphology.'

Abstract: 'Antler cycles are convenient external signs indicating internal changes in reproductive status of male deer. Antler phenology of chital (Axis axis) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) were studied in a deciduous habitat of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Western Ghats, using vehicle transects for 2 successive years. Apparent breeding seasonality occurred with the majority of adult stags in hard antlers from May to mid October in chital (>87\xc2\xa0%), and October to May in sambar (>68\xc2\xa0%). Adult hard antler in chital correlated with mean group size, while sambar showed a weak correlation between adult hard antler and group size. Chitals prefer forming large groups at forest edges and open habitats while sambars prefer dense vegetation cover. Adult hard antlers in chital and sambar showed a weak relation to fawning since most adult females were in oestrus during the peak rutting season. Adult hard antlers in chital associated positively with rainfall and day length while sambar responded weakly to rainfall. We conclude that environmental variables determined species-specific mating strategies in the two deer species.'

Abstract: '\nThe current distribution of Cajanus lineatus in the forest area of the Western Ghats including Kumbharli Ghat, Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala, Khandala and Sinhgarh, from where the species was reported earlier, was estimated. The extensive exploration of these areas revealed that Cajanus lineatus is facing severe threat of habitat loss/fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities. Very few fragmented populations with a small number of plants such as one or two individuals were found and most of them had vanished when visited subsequently. The species almost disappeared from most of the native places as urbanization and road constructions have increased importantly. Cajanus lineatus prefers open places, mainly targeted by these activities. Hence, the present situation of the habitat-specific C. lineatus in these areas is alarming and very soon the species will be at the verge of extinction.\n'

Abstract: 'Cynometra travancorica Bedd. belonging to family Fabaceae is an endangered tree species endemic to Western Ghats with restricted distribution. There is an urgent need for conservation of this endangered species and the vegetative propagation techniques can play major role in planting stock production. Present study focuses on the standardisation of vegetative propagation protocol of C. travancorica using stem cuttings with different concentrations of three plant growth regulating substances in different season. The anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes of the sprouted cuttings belonging to different growth regulator treatments were also conducted. Softwood, semi hardwood and hardwood cuttings were collected in three seasons (January\xe2\x80\x93April, May\xe2\x80\x93August and September\xe2\x80\x93December) and treated with indole 3 butyric acid, indole 3 acetic acid and naphthalene acetic acid in different concentrations. Rooting response was measured after 45\xc2\xa0days in the mist chamber. The adventitious rhizogenesis of C. travancorica stem cuttings was influenced by type of cutting, season of collection, type of growth regulator and its concentration. Semi hardwood cuttings collected during season III treated with 8000\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 IBA recorded about 84% rooting. Anatomical studies on the sprouted cuttings treated with different growth regulator did not show any significant differences, whereas physiological and biochemical parameters of sprouted cuttings varied. Hence, we recommend this treatment combination for the large scale planting stock production.'

Abstract: "This study focuses on the mother-child nexus (or process of enculturation) with respect to knowledge and valuation of wild food plants in a context where accelerated processes of modernization and acculturation are leading to the erosion of knowledge and cultural values associated with wild food plant use, in Wayanad, Western Ghats, India. Wild food plants in this biodiversity hotspot form an important part of local diets and are used as famine foods and medicines. In general, the collection and consumption of these foods are increasingly stigmatized as symbols of poverty and 'tribalness' (equivalent to 'backwardness'). The study, which falls within the discipline of ethnobotany, involves three socio-cultural groups \xe2\x80\x93 the Paniya and Kuruma tribes and non-tribals. Further, it examines the impact in the enculturation process of an unusual educational programme sponsored by the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation that is oriented towards creating awareness among children of cultural identity and local biological resources \xe2\x80\x93 the study compares children having participated in the programme with those who have not, with their mothers. The process of enculturation is assessed by comparing wild food plant knowledge and values between mothers and their children, and by examining events where knowledge transmission occurs, including collection and consumption. For that, quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis tools were used, and methods included semi-structured interviews, photo identification and informal interviews of key informants."

Abstract: 'The Meenachil, the only river that flows through the heart of the Kottayam district of Kerala state, India was selected for the study. The present study has been carried out with an objective to systematically examine the prevalence of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms and to compare the microbiological quality of the river water during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Water samples from 44 different sites during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were collected for the analysis. During the pre-monsoon period, the faecal coliform count ranged from 230 to 110,000 MPN/100\xc2\xa0ml while there was a variation from 200 to 4600 MPN/100\xc2\xa0ml during the post-monsoon period. When the faecal streptococci count was analysed, it ranged from 140 to 110,000 MPN/100\xc2\xa0ml during the pre-monsoon and 70 to 4600 MPN/100\xc2\xa0ml during the post-monsoon seasons, respectively. All the samples collected were found to have total viable count (TVC) higher than those prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards (ISI 1991). Total viable counts were found in the range of 1.1\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0102 to 32\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0102\xc2\xa0cfu/ml in the pre-monsoon and 1.0\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0102 to 26\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0102\xc2\xa0cfu/ml in the post-monsoon. The presence of faecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli and potentially pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella enterica in the Meenachil River indicates that the bacteriological quality of the Meenachil River is poor. Moreover, it sheds light to the fact that raw sewage is being dumped into the Meenachil River. Urban runoffs and effluents of rubber factories appear to be the important sources of faecal contamination in the river. From this study, we conclude that these water bodies pose significant public health hazards. Adequate sanitary infrastructure will help in preventing source water contamination. Besides this, public health education aimed at improving personal, household and community hygiene is urgent.'

Abstract: 'Improved understanding of the processes shaping the assembly of tropical tree communities is crucial for gaining insights into the evolution of forest communities and biological diversity. The climate is thought to be the first order determinant of abundance and distribution patterns of tree species with contrasting traits such as evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. However, the relative role of neutral, and niche-based processes in the evolution of these patterns remain poorly understood.'

Abstract: 'We surveyed slender lorises (Loris lydekkerianus) in Karnataka, south India intermittently during November 2001\xe2\x80\x93July 2004 and estimated their relative abundance via direct sightings. Two subspecies, Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus and L. l. malabaricus, with different morphological traits, occur in the eastern drier region and the western wet region of the state, respectively. The distribution of Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus is patchy in a small region in the southeast, which contradicts earlier reports of its abundance throughout the state. Loris lydekkerianus malabaricus occurs throughout the Western Ghats as a contiguous population. The encounter rates of Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus and L. l. malabaricus are 0.41 individuals/km and 0.21 individuals/km, respectively. Whereas several forest tracts in the distributional range of Loris lydekkerianus malabaricus are protected areas, no such area exists in the distributional range of L. l. lydekkerianus. Loris lydekkerianus faces serious challenges of conservation because it largely occurs in commercial plantations, which can be relatively unstable habitats as harvesting can take place at any time.'

Abstract: 'We have quantitatively analyzed the tree species diversity with respect to soil nutrient status in three sites of a sacred forest ecosystem of Niyamgiri hill range, Eastern Ghats, India. Extensive field surveys and sampling were conducted in 3 sites of the hill range: Site 1 Pterocarpus dominated forest (PTF) (19\xc2\xb040\xe2\x80\xb202.2\xe2\x80\xb3 N and 83\xc2\xb021\xe2\x80\xb223.1\xe2\x80\xb3 E), Site 2 Mangifera dominated forest (MAF) (19\xc2\xb040\xe2\x80\xb202.8\xe2\x80\xb3 N and 83\xc2\xb021\xe2\x80\xb240.8\xe2\x80\xb3 E) and Site 3 Mixed forest (MIF) (19\xc2\xb036\xe2\x80\xb247.1\xe2\x80\xb3 N and 83\xc2\xb021\xe2\x80\xb202.7\xe2\x80\xb3 E). A total of 28 families, 42 genera, 46 tree species, and 286 individual trees were recorded on an area of 0.6 ha. Tree density varied between 470 and 490 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 and average basal area between 3.16 and 10.04 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921. Shannon Index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) ranged from 2.34 to 4.53, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s Index ranged from 0.07 to 0.09, and equitability Index ranged from 0.7 to 1.34. The number of individuals was highest in the girth at breast height (GBH) class of 50\xe2\x80\x9370 cm. The soil nutrient status of the three forest types was related to tree species diversity. The soil pH value of the three sites reflected the slightly acidic nature of the area. Species diversity was positively correlated with organic carbon and phosphorus and negatively with nitrogen, EC and pH. The results of the current study may be helpful to further develop a conservation plan for tree species in tropical sacred forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'In this study, the effects of changes in historical and projected land use land cover (LULC) on monthly streamflow and sediment yield for the Netravati river basin in the Western Ghats of India are explored using land use maps from six time periods (1972, 1979, 1991, 2000, 2012, and 2030) and the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The LULC for 2030 is projected using the land change modeller with the assumption of normal growth. The sensitivity analysis, model calibration, and validation indicated that the SWAT model could reasonably simulate streamflow and sediment yield in the river basin. The results showed that the spatial extent of the LULC classes of urban (1.80\xe2\x80\x939.96%), agriculture (31.38\xe2\x80\x9355.75%), and water bodies (1.48\xe2\x80\x932.66%) increased, whereas that of forest (53.04\xe2\x80\x9327.03%), grassland (11.17\xe2\x80\x934.41%), and bare land (1.09\xe2\x80\x930.16%) decreased from 1972 to 2030. The streamflow increased steadily (7.88%) with changes in LULC, whereas the average annual sediment yield decreased (0.028%) between 1972 and 1991 and increased later (0.029%) until 2012. However, it may increase by 0.43% from 2012 to 2030. The results indicate that LULC changes in urbanization and agricultural intensification have contributed to the increase in runoff, amounting to 428.65 and 58.67\xc2\xa0mm, respectively, and sediment yield, amounting to 348 and 43\xc2\xa0ton/km2, respectively, in the catchment area from 1972 to 2030. The proposed methodology can be applied to other river basins for which temporal digital LULC maps are available for better water resource management plans.'

Abstract: 'The knowledge of tree age is important for understanding tree growth and forest dynamics. It may be estimated by \xe2\x80\x98direct\xe2\x80\x99 methods involving growth ring counts, or by \xe2\x80\x98indirect\xe2\x80\x99 methods involving field measurements of growth rates. Direct methods are considered more accurate, but it is not clear if they are appropriate for all species, notably from the humid tropics. In this paper we assess the occurrence of annual growth rings and their utility for age estimation in three tropical tree species, Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, Dalbergia latifolia (Fabaceae) and Syzygium cumini (Myrtaceae), growing in traditional shade coffee plantations of the southern Western Ghats, India. These species previously were described as having \xe2\x80\x9cindistinct or absent\xe2\x80\x9d growth rings. We used anatomical studies, field measurements and computational methods to characterise growth rings and assess similarities between directly and indirectly estimated tree ages. Our study revealed that annual growth rings were characterised by different sets of anatomical features per species and were most distinct in the fast-growing deciduous A. fraxinifolius. Growth rates measured in the field showed annual periodicity in all three species, and reflected annual rainfall-drought cycles in D. latifolia and S. cumini. Direct age estimates were most similar to indirect estimates in D. latifolia, and least so in S. cumini. The results of direct age estimation by counting rings are consistent with them being annual in nature in tropical species with distinct and reliable annual growth ring formation. However, for species with poorly defined growth rings, indirect age estimation methods might be more useful.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats plays a pivotal role in determining the hydrological and hydroclimatic regime of Peninsular India. The mountainous catchments of the Ghats are the primary contributors of flow in the rivers that sustains the life and agricultural productivity in the area. Although many studies have been conducted in the past decades to understand long term trends in the meteorological and hydrological variables of major river basins, not much attention have been made to unfold the relationship existing among rainfall and river hydrology of natural drainages on either side of the Western Ghats which host one of the unique biodiversity hotspots across the world. Therefore, an attempt has been made in this paper to examine the short term (last three decades) changes in the rainfall pattern and its influence on the hydrological characteristics of some of the important rivers draining the southern Western Ghats as a case study. The short term, annual and seasonal trends in the rainfall, and its variability and discharge were analyzed using Mann-Kendall test and Sen\xe2\x80\x99s estimator of slope. The study showed a decreasing trend in rainfall in the southwest monsoon while a reverse trend is noticed in northeast monsoon. Correspondingly, the discharge of the west and east flowing rivers also showed a declining trend in the southwest monsoon season. The runoff coefficient also followed the trends in the discharge. The runoff coefficient of the Periyar river showed a decreasing trend, whereas the Cauvery river exhibited an increasing trend. A high-resolution analysis of rainfall data revealed that the number of moderate rainfall events showed a decreasing trend throughout the southern Western Ghats, whereas the high intensity rainfall events showed an opposite trend. The decline in groundwater level in the areas which recorded an increase in high intensity rainfall events and decrease in moderate rainfall events showed that the groundwater recharge process is significantly affected by changes in the rainfall pattern of the area.'

Abstract: 'The present study has generated spatial databases on the vegetation type with plant biodiversity, forest fragmentation and disturbance regimes in Tamilnadu parts of Eastern Ghats (EG), India. These databases have been analysed geospatially with landscape ecology approach. The study also includes ground inventory of plant species based on Remote Sensing (RS) data stratification. The vegetation type map was generated from the visual interpretation of two season IRS LISS III data. The spatial landscape analysis of the remotely sensed interpreted images was carried out using customized software, SPLAM. This is first such study in Tamilnadu Eastern Ghats that provides a comprehensive spatial database on vegetation types, disturbance regime and plant species diversity. The study has shown that the dry deciduous and thorn forests have shown better resistance to disturbance compared to the most disturbed evergreen and semievergreen forests. The study outputs are being utilized by forest department and biodiversity boards for conservation action planning and compliance to Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).'

Abstract: 'Kodagu district produces 2% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s coffee, in complex, multistoried agroforestry systems. The forests of the district harbour a large population of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). The combined effects of high elephant density and major landscape changes due to the expansion of coffee cultivation are the cause of human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflicts (HEC). Mitigation strategies, including electric fences and compensation schemes implemented by the Forest Department have met with limited success. Building on previous studies in the area, we assessed current spatial and temporal trends of conflict, analysed local stakeholders\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions and identified factors driving elephants into the estates. Our study, initiated in May 2007, shows that the intensity of HEC has increased over the last 10\xc2\xa0years, exhibiting new seasonal patterns. Conflict maps and the lack of correlation between physical features of the coffee plantations and elephant visits suggest elephants move along corridors between the eastern and western forests of the district, opportunistically foraging when crossing the plantations. Dung analyses indicate elephants have selectively included ripe coffee berries in their diet. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of wild elephants feeding on coffee berries. If this new behaviour spreads through the population, it will compound an already severe conflict situation. The behavioural plasticity, the multiplicity of stakeholders involved, the difficulty in defining the problem and the limits of technical solutions already proposed suggest that HEC in Kodagu has the ingredients of a \xe2\x80\x9cwicked\xe2\x80\x9d problem whose resolution will require more shared understanding and problem solving work amongst the stakeholders.'

Mitigation strategies, including electric fences and compensation schemes implemented by the Forest Department have met with limited success. Building on previous studies in the area, we assessed current spatial and temporal trends of conflict, analysed local stakeholders\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions and identified factors driving elephants into the estates. Our study, initiated in May 2007, shows that the intensity of HEC has increased over the last 10\xc2\xa0years, exhibiting new seasonal patterns. Conflict maps and the lack of correlation between physical features of the coffee plantations and elephant visits suggest elephants move along corridors between the eastern and western forests of the district, opportunistically foraging when crossing the plantations. Dung analyses indicate elephants have selectively included ripe coffee berries in their diet. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of wild elephants feeding on coffee berries. If this new behaviour spreads through the population, it will compound an already severe conflict situation. The behavioural plasticity, the multiplicity of stakeholders involved, the difficulty in defining the problem and the limits of technical solutions already proposed suggest that HEC in Kodagu has the ingredients of a \xe2\x80\x9cwicked\xe2\x80\x9d problem whose resolution will require more shared understanding and problem solving work amongst the stakeholders.'

Title: 'Global Warming Mitigation Through Carbon Sequestrations in the Central Western Ghats'

Abstract: 'Global warming with the escalation in greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint (400\xc2\xa0ppm from 280\xc2\xa0ppm CO2 emissions of the pre-industrial era) and consequent changes in the climate have been affecting the livelihood of people with the erosion of ecosystem productivity. The anthropogenic activities such as power generation (burning of fossil fuels), agriculture (livestock, farming, rice cultivation and burning of crop residues), polluting water bodies, and industry and urban activities (transport, mismanagement of solid, liquid waste, etc.) have risen substantially CO2 concentrations to 72% among GHGs. Emissions and sequestration of carbon need to be in balance to sustain ecosystem functions and maintain the environmental conditions. Forests are the major carbon sinks to mitigate global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the Uttara Kannada district, central Western Ghats, Karnataka. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies towards sustainable management of forests. The study reveals that total carbon stored in vegetation and soils are 56,911.79\xc2\xa0Gg and 59,693.44\xc2\xa0Gg, respectively. The annual carbon increment in forests is about 975.81\xc2\xa0Gg. Carbon uptake by the natural forest is about 2416.69\xc2\xa0Gg/year and by the forest plantations is 963.28\xc2\xa0Gg/year amounting to the total of 3379.97\xc2\xa0Gg/year. Sector-wise carbon emissions are 87.70\xc2\xa0Gg/year (livestock), 101.57\xc2\xa0Gg/year (paddy cultivation), 77.20\xc2\xa0Gg/year (fuel wood consumption), and 437.87\xc2\xa0Gg/year (vehicular transport), respectively. The analysis highlights that forest ecosystems in Uttara Kannada are playing a significant role in the mitigation of regional as well as global carbon emissions. Hence, the premium should be on conservation of the remaining native forests, which are vital for the water security (perennial streams) and food security (sustenance of biodiversity) and mitigation of global warming through carbon sequestration. Sustainable management ecosystem practices involving local stakeholders will further enhance the ability of forests to sequester atmospheric carbon apart from other ecosystem services, such as hydrological services and improvements in soil and water quality.'

Title: 'Development of a new downscaling method for hydrologic assessment of climate change impacts in data scarce regions and its application in the Western Ghats, India'

Abstract: 'Climate change affects local and regional water resources. Especially in regions with water scarcity, high climate sensitivity, and dynamic socioeconomic development, an adaptation of water management strategies is needed. Our study aims at (i) testing a new downscaling approach to utilize climate model results in a meso-scale hydrologic model and at (ii) analyzing the impact of climate change on the water balance components in the Mula and Mutha Rivers catchment upstream of the city of Pune, India. The new downscaling approach relies on the inherent consistency of both, the climate model and the measured data. It allows to derive a representation of a future climate scenario (2009\xe2\x80\x932099) by rearranging past measurements (1988\xe2\x80\x932008). We found a good agreement of the monthly statistics of the rearranged and the original measured data in the baseline period. However, the downscaling method is limited by the range of measured values provided in the baseline period, which results in an underestimation of temperatures in the last 20\xc2\xa0years of the scenario period. The downscaled weather data for IPCC emission scenario A1B were used in a hydrologic impact assessment with SWAT. The scenario resulted in higher evapotranspiration, particularly in the first months of the dry season and in repeated low water storages in the reservoirs at the end of rainy season. Consequently, local and downstream water users as well as rain-fed agriculture and semi-natural vegetation in the Western Ghats increasingly suffer from water stress.'

Abstract: 'The diet and feeding ecology of 12 cyprinid fishes were studied in the Thalayanai stream of southern India. The diet of Barbodes sarana, Danio aequipinnatus and Rasbora daniconius were specialized in terrestrial and aquatic insects. Hypselobarbus dobsoni and Garra mullya consumed vegetative matter and unicellular algae as their most important dietary component, respectively. Hypselobarbus curmuca and Hypselobarbus dubius specialized in crustaceans and molluscs. Puntius amphibious, Puntius bimaculatus, Puntius dorsalis, Puntius filamentosus and Puntius tambraparniei fed on variety of food resources (aquatic insects, algae and detritus) and their feeding intake varied between wet to dry seasons. Levin\xe2\x80\x99s index of diet breadth showed the broadest diets for P. dorsalis in both seasons, whereas G. mullya had a narrow feeding spectrum in both seasons. Among co-existing species, diet overlaps were substantially low during both wet and dry season. These results suggest that feeding specialization and low diet overlap reduce inter-specific competition, allowing co-existence of these cyprinid fishes in this highly structured stream assemblage.'

Abstract: 'Studies on the occurrence of aquatic hyphomycetes were carried out in Panekal sulfur spring in the Western Ghats, India by incubation of leaf litter and analysis of natural foam and of induced foam. Sampling was done once every three months over a period of two years from September 1989 to June 1991. The temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and sulfide content of water were also measured. No fungi were observed within the spring, whereas 16 species belonging to 13 genera were isolated from two outflow sites of the stream. The percent frequency of Triscelophorus monosporus was high (24.0%). The temperature of water in the spring ranged between 30.0 and 38.5\xc2\xb0C and the sulfide content between 3.2 and 4.3 mg 1\xe2\x88\x921. Studies showed that sulfide water (4.0 mg 1\xe2\x88\x921). from the spring inhibited the growth of the colonies of Dactylella aquatica, Phalangispora constricta, Tetracladium setigerum, Vermispora cauveriana, and Wiesneriomyces laurinus. When the leaves colonized by aquatic hyphomycetes were incubated at different temperatures in sulfur-spring water and stream water separately, sporulation was not observed in any of the fungi at and above 35\xc2\xb0C except Phalangispora constricta, which could sporulate at 35\xc2\xb0C. At lower temperatures (15\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xb0C) relatively fewer species were found to sporulate in sulfur-spring water than in stream water.'

Abstract: 'We mapped filamentous fungal association with mechanically \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d woody litter naturally deposited in a stream of the Western Ghats of India. Using a durometer (rubber hardness tester), the toughness of surface of wood collected from stream was determined by considering durometer reading from 60\xe2\x80\x9372 to 30\xe2\x80\x9337 as hardwood and softwood, respectively. From each wood (1.5\xc2\xa0cm diameter), two segments each of 3\xc2\xa0cm length were excised and vertically cut into nine sections comprising eight marginal and one central section. From three stream locations, hardwood and softwood sections were assessed for the occurrence of lignicolous and Ingoldian fungi. A first set of wood sections was incubated in damp chambers up to 4\xc2\xa0months with periodical screening (every 2\xc2\xa0weeks) for lignicolous fungi. Another set was incubated in bubble chambers up to 72\xc2\xa0h to ascertain colonization of Ingoldian fungi. In hardwood sections, 17 lignicolous fungi (ascomycetes, four; mitosporic fungi, 13; mean, 6.8; range, 6\xe2\x80\x938/section) and ten Ingoldian fungi (mean, 2; range, 0\xe2\x80\x934/section) comprising nine lignicolous (11.1\xe2\x80\x9340.7%) and three Ingoldian (11.1\xe2\x80\x9314.8%) fungi as core-group taxa were recovered. In softwood, ten lignicolous fungi (ascomycetes, 0; mitosporic fungi, ten; mean, 3.8; range, 2\xe2\x80\x935/section) and 26 Ingoldian fungi (mean, 8.1; range, 5\xe2\x80\x9310/section) comprising six lignicolous (11.1\xe2\x80\x9385.2%) and 12 Ingoldian (11.1\xe2\x80\x9388.9%) fungi as core-group taxa were recovered. The ratio of lignicolous fungi/Ingoldian fungi was higher in hardwood than softwood (1.7 vs. 0.4). The spore output of Ingoldian fungi was higher in softwood (mean, 901\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921; range, 80\xe2\x80\x932546\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921) than hardwood (mean, 21\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921; range, 0\xe2\x80\x93140\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921). The Shannon diversity of lignicolous fungi was higher in hardwood than softwood (3.604 vs. 2.665), whereas it was opposite for Ingoldian fungi (3.116 vs. 3.918). The overall fungal diversity was higher in softwood than hardwood (4.413 vs. 4.219). The range of Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s index of similarity among wood sections was higher in lignicolous fungi (8\xe2\x80\x9371% and 13\xe2\x80\x9375%) than Ingoldian fungi (0\xe2\x80\x9350% and 8\xe2\x80\x9355%) in hardwood and softwood. The rarefaction indices of expected number of taxa against hardwood sections revealed higher and persistent lignicolous fungi than the Ingoldian fungi, while the Ingoldian fungi were persistent in softwood sections, although they were lower than lignicolous fungi. Our study demonstrated the dominance of lignicolous fungi and Ingoldian fungi in hardwood and softwood, respectively.'

Abstract: 'The bacterial community structure of the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of Pinus patula, found in the Nilgiris region of Western Ghats, was studied by constructing 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. In the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil clone libraries constructed, 13 and 15 bacterial phyla were identified, respectively. The clone libraries showed the predominance of members of culturally underrepresented phyla like Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria clones were predominant in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil samples, respectively. In rhizosphere, amongst Alphaproteobacteria members, Bradyrhizobium formed the significant proportion, whereas in non-rhizosphere, members of subdivision-6 of phylum Acidobacteria were abundant. The diversity analysis of P. patula soil libraries showed that the phylotypes (16S rRNA gene similarity cutoff, \xe2\x89\xa597\xc2\xa0%) of Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes were relatively predominant and diverse followed by Alphaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The diversity indices estimated higher richness and abundance of bacteria in P. patula soil clone libraries than the pine forest clone libraries retrieved from previous studies. The tools like principal co-ordinate analysis and Jackknife cluster analysis, which were under UniFrac analysis indicated that variations in soil bacterial communities were attributed to their respective geographical locations due to the phylogenetic divergence amongst the clone libraries. Overall, the P. patula rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere clone libraries were found significantly unique in composition, evenly distributed and highly rich in phylotypes, amongst the biogeographically distant clone libraries. It was finally hypothesised that the phylogenetic divergence amongst the bacterial phylotypes and natural selection plays a pivotal role in the variations of bacterial communities across the geographical distance.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal associations in 57 ferns and 3 lycophytes (belonging to 15 families in 39 genera) of different life forms (epiphytic, saxicolous and terricolous) occurring in Palni Hills of Western Ghats. Fungal symbiosis was absent in all the three lycophytes examined. Fifty-five of the 57 ferns (91.66\xc2\xa0%) examined had AM and 37 (64.91\xc2\xa0%) had DSE fungal association. This is the first report on AM and DSE fungal association for 22 and 30 species, respectively. In addition, AM morphology was evaluated for the first time in 34 species. Sixty-five percentage of the mycorrhizal ferns had intermediate-type AM and 19.30\xc2\xa0% had typical Paris-type AM morphology. Both Paris- and intermediate-type AM morphologies were observed in 10.53\xc2\xa0% of ferns. The root length colonized by AM and DSE fungal structures significantly varied among species, and a significant negative relation existed between the root length colonized by AM and DSE fungi.'

Abstract: 'The selected study area is a coastal watershed which receives high rainfall in the monsoon season. During this period, most of the water input to the watershed drains to the Arabian Sea without any adequate use due to the rugged topography of the watershed. Hence, an attempt has been made to assess the physical properties specifically morphometric parameters of the Gad watershed using geoinformatics techniques along with field evidence for understanding the relationship between fluvial landforms and hydro-physical parameters in the region. Morphometric parameters have been analyzed and integrated with physical parameters like topography, rainfall, soil, land use\xe2\x80\x93land cover, geology, and geomorphology for evaluating the potential water resource availability in the Gad watershed. The results of the study have shown that there is high surface water availability in the watershed with very low water retaining capacity, mainly in the upper region of the watershed due to presence of basaltic bedrock and steep slopes. Based on this work, a water resource management plan has been suggested at a subwatershed level which established on the physical properties and morphological characteristics of the study area.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the patterns of biodiversity is central to species conservation planning. Here we illustrate chiropteran diversity and distribution pattern of the hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats of Odisha state, India using roost survey and mist net survey techniques. The present study recorded 23 bat species including two newly recorded species for the study site i.e., Hipposideros galeritus and Megaderma spasma. The bat capture rate was the highest in the moist deciduous forest describing higher bat populations compared with the places of human habitation. Utilities of 21 climate, three physiographic and two disturbance variables and species distribution modelling could reveal that the north-eastern part was more suitable for bat distributions than the southern part of the region. The climate, physiographic and disturbance variables were crucial in their distributions, where elevation and potential evapotranspiration were highly significant. Unlike other species, Taphozous melanopogon showed negative correlation with these variables. The mean diurnal temperature and precipitation seasonality have positive influence on bat distributions, indicating their resilience to seasonal precipitation changes and day time temperature fluctuations. The negative effect of temperature seasonality on the distribution of Pteropus giganteus could attribute to its vulnerability to climate change effects. The study provides inputs for monitoring the future spatio-temporal changes, suggesting long term conservation measures. It could generate basic information on the impacts of climate change on bat distribution in the future climate change scenario.'

Abstract: 'The primary deciduous forests in the Eastern Ghats (EG) of Tamil Nadu (TN) India have undergone many changes owing to various need-based forest managements, such as timber extraction for industry, railway sleepers, charcoal, and forest clearance for hydroelectric projects and agriculture, during preindependence and postindependence periods (i.e., from 1800 to 1980). The enactment of a forest conservation act during the 1980s changed the perception of forest managers from utilization to conservation. This study was taken up to assess the forests dynamics in the EG of TN spatially between 1990 and 2003 and nonspatially between 1900 and the 1980s. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS) 1D Linear Imaging and Self Scanning (LISS III) data were used to assess forests during 1990 and 2003, respectively. Field floristic survey and secondary data (such as published literature, floras, books, and forest working plans) were used to assess the forest dynamics in terms of forest type and species composition among the preindependence period, the postindependence period, and the present (i.e., before and after 1980). The satellite data analysis revealed a considerable amount of changes in all forest types during the 13\xc2\xa0years. The comparison of species composition and forest types between the past and present revealed that need-based forest management along with anthropogenic activity have altered the primary deciduous forest in to secondary and postextraction secondary forests such as southern thorn and southern thorn scrub forests in the middle [400\xe2\x80\x93900\xc2\xa0m above mean sea level (MSL)] and lower slopes (<400\xc2\xa0m MSL). However, the evergreen forests present at the upper slope (>900\xc2\xa0m MSL) and plateau seemed not to be much affected by the forest management. The changes estimated by the satellite data processing in the major forest types such as evergreen, deciduous, southern thorn, and southern thorn scrub are really alarming because these changes have occurred after the implementation of a forest conservation act. The dependence of local people on forests for various purposes in this region is also considerably high, which might be a key factor for the changes in the forests. The results of this study not only provide an outlook on the present status of the forests and the change trends but also provide the basis for further studies on forests in the EG of TN.'

Abstract: 'At present the biodiversity in Eastern Ghats is threatened by loss of habitats, exploitation and unscientific management of natural resources, forest fire, biological invasion and other anthropogenic pressures. In this context, we have assessed the forest cover changes, fragmentation and disturbance in the R.V. Nagar Range of Eastern Ghats region, Andhra Pradesh using satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques. Satellite data of IRS-1A LISS II of 1988 and IRS-P6 LISS III of 2006 were assessed for forest cover changes in 1 sq.km grid and generated as Sensitivity Index map. Further the road and settlement buffer of 1000\xc2\xa0m was generated to represent Threat Index map. From 1988 to 2006, the forest cover had a total cover loss of 35.2 sq.km and increase in scrub cover by 7.2%. Over all change analysis from 1988 to 2006 with reference to forest cover indicates, negative changes (loss of forest area) accounted for 48.1 sq.km area and positive changes (gain of forest) for an area of 12.1 sq.km of area. The results of the change detection using multi-date satellite imagery suggest degradation in forest cover over two decades, which necessitates the conservation measures in this range with high priority.'

Abstract: 'Floral composition and structural parameters of the herbaceous vegetation of four recovering tropical dry deciduous forest stands protected for 2, 4, 6 and 10-year periods, on the Eastern Ghats of India, situated at Kandhamal district of Orissa, India were investigated. More than 1\xc2\xa0ha of recovering forest stands of each of the four stages was selected and fifteen sample quadrats of 1\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0m were randomly placed at each stand for vegetation analysis. Floristic analysis revealed highest number of species (69) in 2-year recovering stand, which declined with increase in age. A total of 87 species, 71 genera and 32 families were recorded in the forest stands. Total number of herbaceous species encountered in the stands was 44, 28, 30 and 24 in 2, 4, 6 and 10-year stands, respectively. Total individuals of all herb species were 114, 70, 88 and 68\xc2\xa0plant\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 in 2, 4, 6 and 10-year stands, respectively.

Abstract: 'Agroforestry plays an important role in food security, sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. For understanding the role of agroforestry on biodiversity, a study was undertaken to access butterfly diversity in coffee, cashew and guava plantations in Eastern Ghats of southern Odisha during February\xe2\x80\x93April 2016. A total of 1075 individuals of butterflies belonging to 60 species and 46 genera under five families were recorded during the study. Species richness (S) as well as Shannon diversity (H) were found to be higher in coffee (S\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8945, H\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893.051) plantation, followed by cashew (S\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8931, H\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.807) and guava (S\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8920, H\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.519). However, though butterfly abundance was found to be maximum in coffee (43%), it was higher in guava (33%) followed by cashew (24%). Also, a significant difference was observed between butterfly abundance among three plantations. This shows coffee plantation was the best habitat for butterflies among the three agroforestry habitats studied. The reason for this was habitat heterogeneity in coffee plantation supporting maximum exclusive butterfly species and was least-human influenced with close canopy forest. Over all, family Nymphalidae was found to be the most abundant, and Lycaenidae was the least abundant. The findings of the present study are promising and may set new directions for management of agroforestry plantations in the region to support a rich biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'In tropical evergreen forest in the Kolli Hills of the Indian Eastern Ghats, four 2 ha (100 m \xc3\x97 200 m) replicate plots (two plots each in undisturbed and human-impacted sites), were inventoried for species diversity of lianas \xe2\x89\xa55 cm girth at breast height (g.b.h.) and their relationships with \xe2\x89\xa530 cm g.b.h. host trees. Liana diversity included 26 species from 18 families and 24 genera. The population density and basal area of lianas in the study plots were 48 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 0.23 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively, while those of the trees were 478 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 43.6 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. As the lianas and their hosts had often been cut in the disturbed sites, their diversity was less there than in the undisturbed sites. Five (19%) liana species were common to all four sites. Three lianas, Hiptage benghalensis (Malpighiaceae), Elaeagnus indica (Elaeagnaceae) and Gnetum ula (Gnetaceae) were dominant. The twining mechanism (54% of liana species and 71% of individuals) and zoochorous diaspores (73% of species and 77% of individuals) predominated. A total of 336 trees from 39 species, 34 genera and 22 families hosted 345 lianas. The ratio of liana : host for species was 1 : 1.5 and for individuals was 1 : 1. Liana preferences for certain host trees, host girth classes and trellis heights were evident.'

Abstract: 'Live fencing, an age old and traditional agroforestry practice, remains relatively less understood and least documented at least in India. Exploratory surveys conducted in the northern part of the Eastern ghat region of India covering five districts of three states (Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Chhatisgarh), indicated that traditional farmers have vast knowledge about their live fencing practices and the species used. Two groups of species were observed on the fence. The first group of thirty three species were used primarily for protection and denoted as fence species. Together, they also provide 22 other products and services. The second group of species maintained on the fences for production purposes include five fruit trees, fifteen other trees and two climbers. The fencing practices were classified into two groups (single species and multiple species live fence systems) depending on the species used and into three groups (live fencing around field crops, around backyards or homesteads and around orchards/plantations) depending on the landscapes being protected. Only 20% of fences were dominated by single species; the rest were under multiple species.Ninety percent of house backyards were fenced, whereas only one percent of crop fields and seventy percent orchards were fenced. Some promising fence species of this region are Acacia caesia, A concinna, A. nilotica, Agave sisalana, Annona squamosa, Borassus flabellifer, Carissa carandus, Lawsonia inermis and Murraya koenigii'

Abstract: 'Landscape ecology as a discipline in science is rather young. However its principles appear promising in outlining conservation strategies including a wide range of organisms, particularly birds. Birds due to their mobility use a variety of environmental resources, especially habitats. However, currently these habitats are only available in patches over most of the tropical world. Further whatever is left is under constant human pressure. This paper, therefore, addresses this problem and suggests means of dealing with it using the landscape approach as outlined by landscape ecology.'

Abstract: ' Santalum album L. is an economically important tropical tree species. Owing to extensive logging, changes in land-use patterns and poor natural regeneration, the natural sandal populations are rapidly dwindling. It is feared that such threats could easily undermine the genetic diversity of sandal populations. Effective measures to prevent such loss are prerequisite. We have developed baseline data on the levels of genetic diversity and its distribution on a geographic scale for sandal in India. Based on Geographic Information System, distribution map of sandal was developed and found that the populations were geographically more concentrated in the Deccan plateau. It was found that, for past 53\xc2\xa0years, there was a monotonic decrease in the extraction of sandal in the state of Karnataka, India. Using allozyme markers, the genetic diversity of 19 sandal populations in peninsular India were determined and over all observed heterzygosity (Ho) was found to be 31%. The percent Ho was positively correlated with the density of the sandal populations (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.44) and with increasing longitude it was found to be negatively correlated (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x920.51). The dendrogram analysis indicated a clear clustering of sandal populations based on their geographic occurrence. The Deccan plateau populations were found to be genetically the most diverse and seemed to represent the \xe2\x80\x98hot-spot\xe2\x80\x99 of sandal genetic resources in peninsular India. Our results have important implications for the conservation strategies for sandal populations in peninsular India and can be applied for the conservation of other taxa as well.'

Abstract: 'Environmental implications of Biological spectrum vis-\xc3\xa0-vis tree species diversity in two protected forests of Gandhamardan hill ranges of Eastern Ghats, India, are of great ecological significance in the perspective of climatic change. Biological spectrum includes phanerophytes (38.4\xc2\xa0%), nanophanerophytes (11.4\xc2\xa0%), chamaephytes (5.5\xc2\xa0%), hemicryptophytes (2.4\xc2\xa0%), geophytes (4.1\xc2\xa0%), hydrophytes (0.7\xc2\xa0%), therophytes (27.3\xc2\xa0%), and lianas (10\xc2\xa0%). The comparison with Raunkiaer\xe2\x80\x99s normal spectrum depicts \xe2\x80\x9cPhanero-Therophytic Phytoclimate\xe2\x80\x9d. The present study enlisted of a total of 10,775 trees belonging to 90 tree species within a 17.6\xc2\xa0ha sampled area (441 plots). The Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) is 3.92 (Site-I) and 3.31 (Site-II) with Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s value 1.0. This value indicates that the tropical moist deciduous forests are also species diverse systems. Mean stand density was 671\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Site-I and 565\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Site-II. Ascertaining the phytoclimate of Gandhamardan hill ranges vis-\xc3\xa0-vis tree species diversity and comparing the area on a geographical scale would be helpful for conservation and management of the study area.'

Abstract: 'Data on the conservation status of 167 species of flowering plants presented here are from two representative sectors in south India: (a) the lowlands, characterized by dry deciduous vegetation representative of the Deccan plateau, as also a cluster of eight low altitude hill ranges [to 1200 (1500) m] of the southernmost reaches of the Eastern Ghats of India, and coastlands including mangroves; and (b) the hills, the high altitude hill ranges (to 2475 m) of the Palni hills, an eastward spur of the Western Ghats of India, characterized by evergreen vegetation but largely decimated around the hill station of Kodaikanal with the invasion of alien species since the l840s with the arrival of overseas colonial personnel and the raising of commercial monoculture plantations. Data for the 167 species are entered in 7 + 1 columns for the two regions separately. However, the IUCN red list categories are not used in their entirety for two reasons: (i) the areas are relatively small; (ii) the stress comes more from extrinsic causes like habitat destruction and over-exploitation rather than intrinsic (genetic) causes. However, it is stressed that what is happening over restricted areas over short time intervals is a miniature of what is happening over larger areas over longer periods, and hence these data are vitally important in planning for conservation and eco-restoration. The quality and quantity of new information are decisive; the findings are discussed under nine heads, as the first synthesis of results obtained from over two decades of field work.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests, which play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles, radiation budgets and biodiversity, have undergone rapid changes in land cover in the last few decades. This study examines the complex process of land cover change in the biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats, India, specifically investigating the effects of conservation measures within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary. Current vegetation patterns were mapped using an IRS P6 LISS III image and this was used together with Landsat MSS data from 1973 to map land cover transitions. Two major and divergent trends were observed. A dominant degradational trend can be attributed to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development while a successional trend, resulting from protection of the area, showed the resilience of the system after prolonged disturbances. The sanctuary appears susceptible to continuing disturbances under the current management regime but at lower rates than in surrounding unprotected areas. The study demonstrates that remotely sensed land cover assessments can have important contributions to monitoring land management strategies, understanding processes underpinning land use changes and helping to inform future conservation strategies.'

Abstract: 'Landscape ecology, inter alia, addresses the question as to how altered landscape patterns affect the distribution, persistence, and abundance of a species. Landscape ecology plays an important role in integrating the different scales of biodiversity from habitat patch to biome level. Satellite remote sensing technology with multi-sensor capabilities offers multi-scale information on landscape composition and configuration. Advances in geospatial analytical tools and spatial statistics have improved the capability to quantify spatial heterogeneity. Globally, landscape level characterization of biodiversity has become an important discipline of science. Considering the vast extent, heterogeneity, and ecological and economic importance of forest landscapes, significant efforts have been made in India during the past decade to strengthen landscape level biodiversity characterization. The generic frame work of studies comprises preparation of national databases providing information on composition and configuration of different landscapes using multi-scale remote sensing techniques, understanding the landscape patterns using geospatial models to elicit disturbance and diversity patterns and application of this information for bioprospecting and conservation purposes. Studies on hierarchical linkage of multi-scale information to study the processes of change, landscape function, dynamics of habitat fragmentation, invasion, development of network of conservation areas based on the understanding of multi-species responses to landscape mosaics, macro-ecological studies to understand environment and species richness, habitat and species transitions and losses, landscape level solutions to adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change are a few of the future challenges. The paper presents the current experiences and, analyses in conjunction with international scenario and identifies future challenges of Indian landscape level biodiversity studies.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the distribution and conservation status of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata), rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and Hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) in the state of Karnataka, India. Karnataka is situated in southwest India with an area of 191,791\xc2\xa0km2. A total of 9697\xc2\xa0km of vehicular survey was made from November 2001 to July 2004. We also visited 107 temples/tourist spots to determine the presence of primates. Bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs were widely distributed, whereas rhesus macaques were not found in the state. However, bonnet macaques were absent in a few districts in the northern plains and Hanuman langurs were absent in some districts of the southern plains. A total of 205 groups of bonnet macaques and 139 groups of Hanuman langurs were sighted. The relative encounter rate of both species differed across biogeographic zones. Bonnet macaques were largely encountered in the Western Ghats and the Southern Plateau whereas Hanuman langurs were abundant in the Western Ghats and Northern Plains. We found that bonnet macaques have been eliminated from about 48% temples/tourist spots where they occurred in the recent past. The Hanuman langur population of Dharwar\xe2\x80\x93Haliyal Road was assessed during April 2003, and we found that the present population size was about 38% of a previous survey in 1961. Habitat change, hunting/trapping and translocation were the major factors causing a decline in the langur population.'

Abstract: 'Sacred groves are patches of forests preserved for their spiritual and religious significance. The practice gained relevance with the spread of agriculture that caused large-scale deforestation affecting biodiversity and watersheds. Sacred groves may lose their prominence nowadays, but are still relevant in Indian rural landscapes inhabited by traditional communities. The recent rise of interest in this tradition encouraged scientific study that despite its pan-Indian distribution, focused on India\xe2\x80\x99s northeast, Western Ghats and east coast either for their global/importance or unique ecosystems. Most studies focused on flora, mainly angiosperms, and the faunal studies concentrated on vertebrates while lower life forms were grossly neglected. Studies on ecosystem functioning are few although observations are available. Most studies attributed watershed protection values to sacred groves but hardly highlighted hydrological process or water yield in comparison with other land use types. The grove studies require diversification from a stereotyped path and must move towards creating credible scientific foundations for conservation. Documentation should continue in unexplored areas but more work is needed on basic ecological functions and ecosystem dynamics to strengthen planning for scientifically sound sacred grove management.'

Abstract: 'Director of environmental studies at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Human Ecology, Environmental and Population Studies at the University of Rajasthan. This paper describes the biodiversity in the north-western Indian State of Rajasthan, its relationship with the environment and the existing human and livestock populations. As the biodiversity is depleting in this area due to zoogenic and anthropogenic reasons, certain pragmatic conservation strategies are advocated. The north-western part of India is occupied by a desert ecosystem, the Thar Desert. Animal husbandry is the major livelihood in the region, followed by agriculture. The vegetation, which is predominantly xerophytic and quite sparse, occurs in great variety. Six hundred and eighty-two plant species and 390 animal species have been identified from the Thar Desert. Many plant and animal species have become endangered due to zoogenic and anthropogenic activities. Plants such as Calligonum polygonoides, Tecomella undulata and Prosopis cineraria urgently require conservation.'

Abstract: 'Freshwater fish comprise one of the most threatened vertebrate groups with close to one-third of the species in danger of extinction (Dudgeon 2012) and several species already extinct (Baillie and Butcher 2012). This vulnerability has been largely attributed among others, to the poor state of knowledge (Dudgeon 2003, 2012; Cooke et al. 2012), and the uneven distribution of conservation attention and investment (Darwall et al. 2011a) on freshwater ecosystems and their resources.'

Abstract: 'Vegetation structure and species composition of tropical ecosystems were studied through nine transects at Veerapuli and Kalamalai reserve forests in the Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. Species diversity, dominance, species richness and evenness indices of plant communities and also population structure of woody plants were enumerated. A total of 244 species (183 genera and 76 families) were recorded. Species richness (number of species) were 82,142 and 96 species per 0.3 ha respectively for the study areas of low-elevation forest (LEF), mid-elevation forest (MEF) and high elevation forest (HEF). Species diversity indices were greater in MEF compared to the other two forests except juveniles. In contrast, greater dominance value indices were recorded in LEF than other forests. Density and basal area of the MEF were twice greater than the LEF, while HEF showed greater tree density and low basal area when compared to LEF. The stem density and species richness (number of species) decreased with increased size classes of trees observed in the present study indicated good regeneration status. Population structure of juveniles and seedlings also reflects good regeneration status. Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 99.9) and Hopea parviflora (IVI of 103.8) were dominant tree species respectively in LEF and MEF whereas in HEF Agrostistachys meeboldii (63.65), Cullenia excelsa (63.67) and Drypetes oblongifolia (39.67) share the dominance. Past damage (anthropogenic perturbation) may be one of the reasons for single species dominance in LEF and MEF. Occurrence of alien species such as Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conyzoides also indicated the past disturbance in LEF. The variations in plant diversity and population structure are largely due to anthropogenic perturbation and other abiotic factors.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests are the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest terrestrial storehouses of carbon and are recognized as rich, diverse and highly productive ecosystems. The present study was conducted to characterize the land use, diversity and biomass of tropical forest in Western Ghat of Maharashtra State in India through satellite remote sensing and GIS. The study has been designed and implemented to promote analysis on Western Ghat biodiversity resources including trees, shrubs and herbs based on inventorying, monitoring and mapping. Field measured biomass is integrated with spectral responses of various bands and indices of the Landsat TM satellite image for estimation of above-ground biomass in a 36,046\xc2\xa0km2 area of relic forest in the Central Western Ghat. The above-ground biomass from field-based inventory varied from 30.2 to 151.1\xc2\xa0ton/ha in moist deciduous forest, 9.2\xe2\x80\x9399.1\xc2\xa0ton/ha in dry deciduous forest, 42.1\xe2\x80\x93158.6\xc2\xa0ton/ha in semi-evergreen forest, and 160.9\xe2\x80\x93271\xc2\xa0ton/ha in evergreen forest. The total above-ground biomass of the study area was estimated to be 95.2\xc2\xa0M tons. A regression equation between field above-ground biomass and a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was used for spectral modeling to estimate and prepare the above-ground biomass map in the region. A total 120 plant species in 81 genera and 31 families were identified in the study area. This study emphasizes the importance of relic forests for their biodiversity, carbon sequestration and total biomass.'

Abstract: 'Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers were applied to evaluate the genetic variation in endemic and endangered yellow catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma sampled from three geographic locations of Western Ghat, South India river systems. In RAPD, of 32 10-mer RAPD primers screened initially, 10 were chosen and used in a comparative analysis of H. brachysoma collected from Meenachil, Chalakkudy and Nethravathi River systems. Of the 124 total RAPD fragments amplified, 49 (39.51%) were found to be shared by individuals of all 3 populations. The remaining 75 fragments were found to be polymorphic (60.48%). In microsatellites, six polymorphic microsatellite loci were identified by using primers developed for Pangasius hypophthalmus, Clarias macrocephalus and Clarias gariepinus. The identified loci were confirmed as microsatellite by sequencing after making a clone. The nucleotide sequences of 6 loci were published in NCBI genbank. The number of alleles across the six loci ranged from 4 to 7 and heterozygosities ranged from 0.07 to 0.93. The mean number of alleles and effective number of alleles per locus were 5.00 and 3.314, respectively. The average heterozygosity across all investigated samples was 0.72, indicating a significant deficiency of heterozygotes in this species. RAPD and microsatellite methods reported a high degree of gene diversity and genetic distances depicted by UPGMA dendrograms among the populations of H. brachysoma.'

Abstract: 'The genus Isoetes L. in India is represented by 14species, of which eight species are recognized as being local endemics [confinedto one particular phyto-geographical division (PGD)] while the remaining sixoccur in more than one PGD and are described as endemic to a wider range. Thelocal endemic species are Isoetes dixitei,Isoetes panchganiensis and Isoetessahyadriensis in Western Ghats region; Isoetespantii, Isoetes bilaspurensis, Isoetesreticulata and Isoetes tuberculata inChotanagpur Malwa Vindhya Plateau and Isoetes debii innortheastern India. The wider endemic species are Isoetespanchananii, Isoetes sampathkumaranii,Isoetes rajasthanensis, Isoetesmahadevensis, Isoetes indica andIsoetes coromandelina. Our studies on the patterns ofendemism suggest that the radiation of quillworts advanced from dry lowlandareas to the rainy uplands and mountains. Isoetescoromandelina is the first Indian quillwort to colonize in lowlandsof the coastal zone (Coromandel), from where it spread to different parts of thesub-continent and gave rise to new species. Thus this species is a key Indianspecies which has played an important role in the radiation of quillwort in thecountry and appeared as the connecting link among the quillwort flora of variousPGDs. The centres of diversity for almost all the presently known Indianquillworts species are recognized.'

Abstract: 'Diversity in morphological characters of 206 accessions of 14 wild Vigna species from India was assessed. Of these, 12 species belonged to Asian Vigna in the subgenus Ceratotropis and two were V. vexillata and V. pilosa belonging to subgenus Plectotropis and Dolichovigna, respectively. Data on 71 morphological traits, both qualitative and quantitative, were recorded. Data on 45 qualitative and quantitative traits exhibiting higher variation were subjected to multivariate analysis for establishing species relationships and assessing the pattern of intraspecific variation. Of the three easily distinguishable groups in the subgenus Ceratotropis, all the species in mungo-radiata group, except V. khandalensis, viz. V. radiata var. sublobata, V. radiata var. setulosa, V. mungo var. silvestris and V. hainiana showed greater homology in vegetative morphology and growth habit. The species, however, differed in other plant, flower, pod and seed characteristics. Within species variation was higher in V. mungo var. silvestris populations and three distinct clusters could be identified in multivariate analysis. V. umbellata showed more similarity to V. dalzelliana than V. bourneae and V. minima in the angularis-umbellata (azuki bean) group. Within species variations was higher in V. umbellata than other species in the group. In the aconitifolia-trilobata (mothbean), V. trilobata populations, were more diverse than V. aconitifolia. The cultigens of the conspecific wild species were more robust in growth, with large vegetative parts and often of erect growth with three- to five-fold increase in seed size and seed weight, except V. aconitifolia, which has still retained the wild type morphology to a greater extent. More intensive collection, characterisation and conservation of species diversity and intraspecific variations, particularly of the close wild relatives of Asian Vigna with valuable characters such as resistance to biotic/abiotic stresses, more number of pod bearing clusters per plant etc. assumes great priority in crop improvement programmes.'

Abstract: 'An ecosystem approach is the only way to conserve habitats and the enormous number of species. The related area-based Aichi biodiversity target of the convention on biological diversity aims to conserve at least 17% of terrestrial environment by 2020. This is the first regional study to recognize a network of key habitats to achieve conservation goals. It is essential to have a spatial framework by creating the indicator using existing remote sensing-based data. In this work, conservation principles were integrated at the ecosystem level covering irreplaceability and vulnerability along with representativeness. Forest persistence, ecosystem rarity, forest intactness, landscape-level ecosystem, biomass carbon stocks, and biological richness were among the biological criteria used to analyze ecosystem irreplaceability. The proxies used for ecosystem vulnerability are high fragmentation, fire hotspots and proximity to disturbance factors. A unique value is assigned to each individual pixel in the prioritization map. Overall representation of habitat coverage in protected area network of South Asian countries indicates under-representation of several forest types with less than 17% coverage. The overlay of the priority areas proposes that there is a possibility of conserving many species with the notification of protected areas. This study demonstrates the conservation priorities by identifying key habitats based on multiple conservation principles.'

Abstract: 'The forestry sector is being increasingly considered for abatement of greenhouse gases. A number of projects are likely to be implemented, particularly in tropical countries. It is essential to measure, record, and verify the carbon sequestered or emission avoided due to implementation of the forestry mitigation options. In this paper a set required parameters to be monitored for estimating carbon flows, monitoring methods, and institutional arrangements are presented along with a case study of the Western Ghat Forestry and Environment project.'

Abstract: 'Species occurrences gathered from the literature, from atlases or from field surveys are currently used to analyze multispecific patterns, such as species richness or species geographic ranges. Such occurrences result from the independent recognitions of specimens by several botanists in particular places and at particular occasions. Thereby, the analysis of the resulting occasional \xe2\x80\x98relev\xc3\xa9s\xe2\x80\x99 involves the assignment of the species occurrences to spatial units such as a grid of quadrats. As a result, the distribution of occurrences among quadrats is controlled while their distribution among species is observed. In this paper we show how non-symmetric correspondence analysis (NSCA) enables the investigation of data structure by taking into account this fundamental asymmetry. We apply this new ordination technique to a list of endemic tree species occurrences in the Western Ghats (South India). We explore the interesting properties of NSCA as an ordination technique and demonstrate the usefulness of the method as a tool in biogeography. Regarding the Western Ghats, NSCA brings out the preponderance of deforestation over biogeographic history in explaining the observed multispecific patterns.'

Abstract: 'Culturally protected forest patches or sacred groves have been the integral part of many traditional societies. This age old tradition is a classic instance of community driven nature conservation sheltering native biodiversity and supporting various ecosystem functions particularly hydrology. The current work in Central Western Ghats of Karnataka, India, highlights that even small sacred groves amidst humanised landscapes serve as tiny islands of biodiversity, especially of rare and endemic species. Temporal analysis of landuse dynamics reveals the changing pattern of the studied landscape. There is fast reduction of forest cover (15.14\xe2\x80\x9311.02\xc2\xa0%) in last 20\xc2\xa0years to meet up the demand of agricultural land and plantation programs. A thorough survey and assessment of woody endemic species distribution in the 25\xc2\xa0km2 study area documented presence of 19 endemic species. The distribution of these species is highly skewed towards the culturally protected patches in comparison to other land use elements. It is found that, among the 19 woody endemic species, those with greater ecological amplitude are widely distributed in the studied landscape in groves as well as other land use forms whereas, natural population of the sensitive endemics are very much restricted in the sacred grove fragments. The recent degradation in the sacred grove system is perhaps, due to weakening of traditional belief systems and associated laxity in grove protection leading to biotic disturbances. Revitalisation of traditional practices related to conservation of sacred groves can go a long way in strengthening natural ecological systems of fragile humid tropical landscape.'

Abstract: 'This paper examines the status and characteristics of agrobiodiversity present in Kerala State, India, which is a part of the Western Ghats\xe2\x80\x94Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot. They show much heterogeneity. The State grows 142 crop plants belonging to 104 genera and 43 families. Almost the entire agrobiodiversity conservation work is being carried out by the central government, even though the states are also mandated to do this work. This appears to have an adverse effect on agrobiodiversity conservation. Until now, most attention was being paid to only the most important food and commercial crops, and very limited to their wild relatives and the less important crop plants.'

Abstract: 'Soil erosion induces land degradation and minimizes the water-holding capacity, resulting in poor environmental quality at a basin scale. This becomes more serious due to long-term anthropogenic pressure including over exploitation of natural resources and lack of sustainable development. In this study, an automated RUSLE-SY model was developed to identify the potential soil erosion and sediment yield zones in Tamiraparani sub-basin, South India. The input parameters required to execute the RUSLE-SY model are digital elevation model, study area boundary, land-use/land-cover data, soil data, annual rainfall data, near-infrared and red bands from satellite imagery. The entire set of data was geoprocessed with standard RUSLE and sediment yield equations for generating soil erosion and sediment yield map. The distribution of soil erosion and sediment yield in the study area was analyzed, and its impacts were discussed. The result reveals that the high soil erosion is noticed in the western part of the sub-basin (31.25\xc2\xa0ton\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921). Moreover, the sediment yield in this area contributes around 14.54\xc2\xa0ton\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The low level of soil erosion and sediment yield (~95\xc2\xa0% of the area) reflects the climatic variability and topography of Tamiraparani sub-basin. The resulting RUSLE-SY model provides a robust and easy to use soil erosion and conservation management tool for efficient planning in similar environments.'

Abstract: 'Pill-millipedes of the genus Arthrosphaera (Sphaerotheriidae) has restricted geographic distribution (Southern India, Sri Lanka and Madagascar) were under studied category of soil macrofauna. In the current study, seven morphospecies of Arthrosphaera were recovered in four biomes of the Western Ghats and west coast of India. In locations Makutta (A. fumosa), Karike (A. fumosa), Ninthikal (A. dalyi), Uppinangadi (A. magna) and Uppala (A. hendersoni) were endowed with only one species of Arthrosphaera. Although some locations consist of more than one species, one of them was dominated. Shankaraghatta forest consists of A. disticta and A. versicolor, but A. disticta was highly dominant. In Adyanadka plantations, A. magna was dominant than A. carinata. The highest number of A. disticta was recorded per quadrate in high-altitude location (Shimoga), followed by A. hendersoni in the coastal location (Uppala), A. magna (Adyanadka) and A. dalyi (Ninthikal) in foothill locations. The highest biomass of A. dalyi per quadrate was seen in Ninthikal, followed by A. magna in Adyanadka, A. disticta in Shimoga, A. fumosa in Karike and A. magna in Adyanadka and Uppinangadi. The richness of Arthrosphaera was positively correlated with biomass, conductivity, total nitrogen, potassium contents in soil and negatively correlated with calcium content in soil.'

Abstract: 'Globally, as on today, only about two million species have been identified, while the actual number of species is estimated to be between 10 and 30 million. This enormous treasured biodiversity is an essential provider of ecosystem goods and services to the mankind. Aquatic germplasm resources of India comprise whole lot of organisms, both animals and plants origin, it is mainly the finfish and shellfish species which have actual and potential value for both capture fisheries and aquaculture. These aquatic resources possess enormous potential to contribute towards the economic well-being of the nation, besides contributing to genetic improvement of farmed aquatic species. However, in spite of the important role that the biodiversity plays in our lives, all species that together comprise biodiversity have been facing huge risks, especially due to a number of anthropogenic factors. In the present paper an attempt has been made to review the approaches, modern genetic tools and modus operandi which are relevant to the management of the resources and to outline the future opportunities in research efforts for sustainable fish production to address the food concerns of the country.'

Abstract: 'Gray slender lorises (Loris lydekkerianus) are 1 of 2 nocturnal primate genera occurring in India. Although the distribution and abundance of the species is known for some parts of southern India, the relative distribution of the 2 subspecies, Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus and L. l. malabaricus, and their comparative densities and extent of overlap between their distributions remains largely unknown. We investigated the distribution pattern and relative density of slender lorises in the Western Ghats mountain range in the state of Kerala in southern India. We surveyed 36 forest ranges in 17 forest divisions of northern and central Kerala from February to November 2009 for the presence of lorises. We sighted slender lorises in 22 forest ranges in a variety of vegetation types, and the relative abundance of the species ranged from 0.02 to 1.44 lorises/km. Our results confirm that both loris subspecies are present in Kerala: Mysore slender lorises have a narrow patchy distribution on the eastern edges of the Western Ghats mountain range, and Malabar slender lorises have a fairly contiguous distribution on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. We recommend more detailed surveys in southern Kerala to identify the distribution patterns of the subspecies in these areas.'

Abstract: "The Gavlis are a pastoral caste of the forested hill tracts of India 's Western Ghats region. This paper examines their shift under British colonial rule from buffalo-keepers to goatherds to cultivators of increasingly marginal hill tracts, the context of forest exploitation and malaria control as well as more recent dairy development programs of the Indian government. It concludes that if present trends continue Gavlis everywhere will follow the same progression, eventually becoming landless migrants."

Abstract: 'Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on species diversity and vegetation structure of a lowland tropical rainforest was studied in the foothills of Eastern Himalaya, India. Tree species richness, density, basal area and the diversity indices were found significantly (P<0.05) decreased with the increasing level of disturbances whereas, shrub density, basal area and herb density significantly increased with increasing disturbance level. In case of shrubs, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas Pielou\xe2\x80\x99s evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that 10\xe2\x80\x9350 cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication. Furthermore, present study suggests the need of adequate biodiversity conservation measures and adaptation of sustainable forest management approaches in disturbed areas of lowland tropical rainforest in the foothills of eastern Himalaya, India.'

Abstract: 'The graphite-tungsten deposits under consideration in this study are located in the Burugubanda, Pydiputta, Tapasikonda, Marripalem and Madyaratigudem areas of the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India. These deposits were formed due to wide spread tectonothermal events associated with the evolution of Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB). The graphite deposits of East Godavari district are epigenetic, rhombohedral fluid deposited type and are one of the four deposits of such type reported so far from Srilanka, Spain and England. The graphite deposits were formed due to granodioritic intrusion into the Narsipatnam shear zone, which caused migmatisation of khondalites along with mobilisation and concentration of graphite, as veins and lenses, into the graphite gneisses. The graphite gneisses were subsequently intruded by quartz rich pegmatites that were laden with tungsten mineralisation. The tungsten mineralisation occurs as thin bands, lenses, stringers and vein lets within the quartz matrix and also dispersed in the graphite gneisses. Inclusions of tungsten in graphite indicate that tungsten mineralisation succeeded graphite mineralisation. However, the low P-T phenomenon of tungsten (wolframite-ferberite) mineralisation resulted in low tenor of tungsten ore deposits (WO3: 0.10%). Rare earth elements (REE) are associated with tungsten mineralisation in these areas. During the present study, these graphite-tungsten deposits have been re-examined, in the backdrop of shelving graphite-tungsten projects in these areas. The feed for mineral beneficiation tests was decided on the basis of dispersion of tungsten in quartz and graphite rich fractions of the ore zone. The feed (ROM material) on beneficiation gave recovery of +75% graphite concentrate, tungsten concentrate of consistent chemical grade, besides recovery of sizeable REE concentrate. It also rendered use of unutilised graphite tailing dumps at beneficiation plants, thereby effecting conservation. Thus, the association of tungsten and REE with the entire graphite deposits along with their value addition during beneficiation, as by-product, revived opportunities to restart graphite mining in the Burugubanda, Pydiputta and Tapasikonda areas in particular and East Godavari district, in general, as an economically viable venture. This will initiate opening of graphite mines in other districts of Andhra Pradesh and energise economics of working graphite mines within EGMB, in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha and Tamil Nadu.'

Abstract: 'This article compares a range of initiatives aimed at involving people in the management of forest resources in Nepal and India. In Nepal, we focus on three categories of state-initiated programs: community forestry, the parks\xe2\x80\x99 buffer zone program, and leasehold forestry. In the southern Indian state of Karnataka, we study the state-initiated Joint Forest Planning and Management program along with older institutions of leaf manure forests (Soppina betta) and historical sacred forests (Kans). We conclude that state-initiated approaches to involving communities have been limited, at best, promote standardized and relatively inflexible management practices, and lead to partial improvement in biodiversity and people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihoods. When management is initiated and owned by the community, as in the case of sacred groves in India, and when other conditions are appropriate, communities can have the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for putting effective and adaptive conservation practices in place.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation is recognized as one of the most significant components in LULCC and global changes scenario. It is imperative to assess its trend and the rate at which it is occurring. The changes will have long-lasting impact on regional climate and in turn on biodiversity. Present study was taken up in Kanakapura and surrounding areas located on the fringes of Western Ghats biodiversity hot-spots. Temporal satellite data from Landsat was classified into forest cover maps. Drivers of forest cover changes such as roads and settlements were used in order to create predicted map of the region using GEOMOD tool in Idrisi Andes. The predicted map was then validated using actual land cover map of same year prepared from Landsat data. The validated map was found to be 84.26 % accurate. The validation was also tested using ROC approach which was found to be 0.614. The model was then further extended to predict forest cover losses for year 2015. The results highlight ongoing deforestation in the areas adjoining Western Ghats. It also presents an application of the tool and the validation methods which can be used in predictive modeling related studies.'

Abstract: ' Rhododendron arboreum of the family Ericaceae represents one of the ancient relict tree species of the genus showing extreme disjunction in the Indian subcontinent. It is represented by two sub-species viz., ssp. arboreum Smith in the forests of north-eastern India (temperate) and spp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg distributed in the southern Western Ghats (tropical) of India with apparently no distribution in the intervening plains. 35 Samples corresponding to different locations in the tropical montane forests of Nilgiris and temperate forests of northeast India were analyzed for distribution of genetic variation using 25 random primers. Relatively high genetic diversity was measured in the temperate populations (Ht = 0.21; Nm = 1.13) than tropical Rhododendrons. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed that among the total variance, 25% is residing within populations while 63% of variance is among regions apparently revealing that disjunct distribution has structured genetic differentiation pattern in this species. Grouping of samples was in conformity with their spatial distribution, which was confirmed by UPGMA cluster analysis and PCA scatter plot. The taxon with its unique distribution pattern and wide cross compatibility between sub-species is however threatened by low genetic variation and gene flow that catalyses it\xe2\x80\x99s shifting towards genetic drift and hence long-term conservation strategies need to be formulated particularly for the tropical Rhododendron sub-species. Among the various hypotheses and theory proposed to explain the Malayan affinity in the flora and fauna of Western Ghats, Satpura hypothesis based on dispersal model of distribution largely explains the discontinues distribution of R. arboreum.'

Abstract: 'Sacred groves are forest patches conserved by the local people intertwined with their socio-cultural and religious practice. These groves harbour rich biodiversity and play a significant role in the conservation of biodiversity. Population structure and regeneration status of woody species were studied during 2001\xe2\x80\x932002 in the four sacred groves of Manipur, a state in north east India. A total of 96 woody species was recorded from the four groves, the highest being Konthoujam Lairembi sacred grove (55 species) and lowest in Heingang Marjing sacred grove having 42 species. The density\xe2\x80\x93diameter distribution of woody species in the four groves showed highest stand density and species richness in the lowest girth class (30\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm) and decreased in the succeeding girth classes. Overall population structure of the groves based on the number of tree seedlings, saplings and adults, displayed a greater proportion of seedlings followed by saplings and adults while for the selected tree species it varied seasonally and recruitment of species increased during rainy season attaining peak during June. Regeneration status of the four sacred groves based on strength of different age groups in their population showed good regeneration. High occurrence of \xe2\x80\x98additional species\xe2\x80\x99 to the groves may be due to the invasion through dispersal from other areas. Possibly, the prevailing favourable microenvironmental conditions contributed to their establishment and growth in the groves. Absence of seedlings and saplings of some of the species in the groves may be due to their poor seed germination and establishment of seedlings in the forest.'

Abstract: 'We review the current status of experimental studies in India to understand the linkages between afforestation and hydrology. This discipline deals with the use and management of water, social awareness of environmental problems, and ecosystem limitations on provision of watershed services by river basins in the mountain regions of India. Our review begins with examination of experimental works in tropical countries and proceeds to discussion of initiatives of Indian research institutes and Government organizations towards establishing experimental watersheds to understand the impacts of land cover changes on hydrologic regimes in the Indian sub-continent. This is followed by the review of the experimental work carried out by various authors to assess the impact of land cover changes on major water balance components such as, runoff, groundwater, evapotranspiration and sediment yield. The spatial scales of these experiments have been limited to small watersheds or field plots. This paper also describes impacts of human interventions (such as plantations of exotic forest species to restore degraded landscapes) on the water balance components in diverse hydro-geo-environmental conditions in the Indian sub-continent. We focus on identifying the research areas which require immediate attention to develop tools to assist planners and policy makers in assessing and managing the water resources in these complex environments. The review is largely based on research results reported during the last 20 to 30 years.'

Title: 'Promoting native trees in shade coffee plantations of southern India: comparison of growth rates with the exotic Grevillea robusta '

Abstract: 'Traditional shade coffee plantations of Kodagu district, in the Western Ghats of southern India, harbor a high density and diversity of trees. Local farmers appreciate native biodiversity, but plantation economics and public policies drive them to gradually replace the original diversified cover with exotic shade trees such as Grevillea robusta, which grows fast and can be easily traded as timber. In order to identify and recommend native timber trees with fast growth rates, we compared the growth performance of four common native species against that of G. robusta, by fitting steel dendrometer bands on 332 shade trees. Results showed that in general G. robusta had the fastest growth rates, but large trees of the native Acrocarpus fraxinifolius had faster growth in the wet western side of the district. Computer projections of long term performance showed that most species were influenced by bioclimatic zone. Species-specific local environmental effects also occurred, including competition from coffee bushes for A. fraxinifolius, influence of aspect for G. robusta, and management block effects for Lagerstroemia microcarpa. Our results show that native species  potentially could produce timber at rates equivalent to those of exotic species. However, as in many tropical countries, data on growth rates of native trees within mixed-cover plantations are scarce and this study underlines the urgent need to screen for fast-growing species. Such information provides a strong basis for recommending appropriate changes in public policies that would improve tree tenure security and encourage farmers to grow more native species.'

Abstract: 'Tree species diversity and population structure at different community types were described and analyzed for primary and secondary lowland moist deciduous forests in Tripura. Overall 10,957 individual trees belonging to 46 family, 103 genera and 144 species were counted at \xe2\x89\xa530 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) using 28 permanent belt transects with a size of 1 ha (10 m \xc3\x97 1000 m). Four different tree communities were identified. The primary forests was dominated by Shorea robusta (mean density 464.77 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 105 species) and Schima wallichii (336.25 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 82 species), while the secondary forests was dominated by Tectona grandis (333.88 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 105 species) and Hevea brasiliensis (299.67 trees\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 82 species). Overall mean basal area in this study was 18.01m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921; the maximum value was recorded in primary Shorea forest (26.21 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921). Mean density and diversity indices were differed significantly within four different communities. No significant differences were observed in number of species, genera, family and tree basal cover area. Significant relationships were found between the species richness and different tree population groups across the communities. Results revealed that species diversity and density were increased in those forests due to past disturbances which resulted in slow accumulation of native oligarchic small tree species. Seventeen species were recorded with <2 individuals of which Saraca asoka (Roxb.) de Wilde and Entada phaseoloides (L.) Merr. etc. extensively used in local ethno-medicinal formulations. The present S. robusta Gaertn dominated forest was recorded richer (105 species) than other reported studies. Moraceae was found more speciose family instead of Papilionaceae and Euphorbiaceae than other Indian moist deciduous forests. Seasonal phenological gap in such moist deciduous forests influenced the population of Trachypithecus pileatus and capped langur. The analysis of FIV suggested a slow trend of shifting the population of Lamiaceae group by Moraceae species in secondary T. grandis L. dominated community.'

Abstract: 'Molecular techniques are gaining importance in biodiversity conservation in India. They are especially beneficial in the case of rare species with cryptic habits that make them difficult study subjects when using conventional field techniques. Molecular tools can be used to decipher distributions and population connectedness in fragmented habitats and identify populations of immediate conservation concern. We discuss these with case studies on some cat species in India.'

Abstract: 'Watersheds from semiarid regions are more sensitive to hydrological processes and sustainability of water resources than humid regions. Hence, it is indispensable to determine the response of watersheds to hydrological processes for water resource management. Thus, the hydrological response-based watershed prioritization study has been undertaken for eight sub-watersheds from semiarid, basaltic region of Western Ghats of India. Intent to this, a novel index has been parameterized using thematic layers such as drainage density, geology, soil, slope, landform classification, land use/land cover, rainfall and runoff (DGSLR). This study evaluates the performance of DGSLR index using three models, namely analytical hierarchy process (AHP), frequency ratio (FR) and fuzzy logic for sub-watershed-wise prioritization. The FR ratio showed the highest value for very high drainage density (8.73) indicating most probability for a high hydrological response. According to AHP weight, most influencing factors to hydrological processes are precipitation (25%), slope (19%) and land use/land cover (14%) followed by landform classification (11%). These three methods\xc2\xa0are prioritized\xc2\xa0study area into four classes, i.e., very high, high, moderate and low using area-weighted average method. These models showed that very high-priority area lies near the outlet of the watershed as well as the upper part of the watershed in high to very high priority in all three models. It covers 33.12% of the total area having a high average slope with high drainage density in sub-watersheds 1, 3, 7 and 8. The predictive capability of DGSLR index was computed by the area under the curve (AUC) and receiver operating characteristic\xc2\xa0(ROC) method, revealed average accuracy for FR method (AUC\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa089%) better than AHP method (AUC\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa077%) and fuzzy logic (AUC\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa076%). This novel index could be used by the water resources researchers and planners in any terrain to understand the hydrological response.'

Title: 'A framework for considering ecological interactions for common non-timber forest product species: a case study of mountain date palm (Phoenix loureiroi Kunth) leaf harvest in South India'

Abstract: 'Many economically important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) come from widespread and common plant species. Harvest of these species often is assumed to be sustainable due to their commonness. However, because of the ecological roles of common species, harvest may affect and be affected by ecological interactions at broader scales, which are rarely considered when evaluating the sustainability of harvest. We use a case study of the mountain date palm (Phoenix loureiroi Kunth), harvested in South India to produce brooms, to present a conceptual framework illustrating how intensive harvest of a common species interacts with other anthropogenic management practices, plant-animal interactions and surrounding environmental conditions.'

Abstract: 'Rapid clonal propagation and encapsulation of in vitro-formed bulbs of Ipsea malabarica (Reichb. f.) J. D. Hook., an endemic and endangered orchid of the Western Ghats of Kerala, and its reintroduction to the natural habitat were accomplished. Rhizome segments of Ipsea cultured on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6.97 \xce\xbcM kinetin induced the highest number of shoots, at the rate of four shoots per explant within 50 d. Transfer of the isolated shoots increased the rate of shoot multiplication to more than 10 shoots. Subsequent culture enhanced the number of shoots. No decline of shoot multiplication was observed up to the 10th subculture. Shoots developed bulbs during culture which developed into rhizomes. Sucrose at 6\xe2\x80\x938% reduced the time for the development of bulbs and rhizomes. Roots were developed from the base of the developed shoots as well as from the bulbs. Isolation and culture of bulbs also developed 5\xe2\x80\x9310 shoots within 50 d. Encapsulated in vitro-formed bulbs cultured either on hormone-free halfstrength MS or 6.97 \xce\xbcM kinetin-supplemented medium facilitated 100% conversion. As a step to conservation in situ, 50 plantlets were reintroduced into their natural habitat, i.e. at Vellarimala (at 1300 m height) of the Western Ghats of Kerala, and flowered normally. Development of more than 40 000 plantlets starting from a single explant is possible within 250 d. This threatened endemic orchid stands to benefit greatly from the established protocol and will hopefully curtail the threat of extinction.'

Abstract: 'Global conservation efforts have traditionally focused on biodiversity hotspots and other priority landscapes. However, large areas outside priority sites have high conservation value and are referred to as neglected landscapes. The Eastern Ghats of India is an unexplored forest landscape of high conservation value with several endemic and threatened species reported, and is also home to many indigenous forest-dwelling communities. However, it remains a neglected area for conservation and only 3.53% of this landscape is protected. Here, we examine the effectiveness of protected areas in neglected landscapes in preventing forest degradation, and how community perceptions can be used to understand satellite-based landscape change analyses at village level. This study was conducted in Papikonda National park (PNP) and its unprotected buffers in India\xe2\x80\x99s Eastern Ghats. Forest degradation was higher in the buffer (32%) than inside PNP (12%) between 1991 and 2014. Communities attributed shifting cultivation, plantations and over-extraction of forest resources as being the major drivers of forest degradation. Community observations of change were not significantly correlated with spatial measures of change. Forest degradation was higher outside the PA at a landscape level and inside the PA at the village level, therefore the PA was effective in reducing degradation at the landscape level but not at the village level inside the PA. We further discuss the role of community observations in interpreting forest degradation in neglected forest landscapes.'

Abstract: 'Landslide is one of the devastating natural phenomenon that threatens human life and property. Every year a number of persons lost their lives due to the landslides. Therefore, a better understanding and characterization of landslide is very essential for adopting mitigation strategies to contain the adversities of this natural hazard. Information on landslides from different climatic setup are very essential for better understanding of the influence of weathering, rainfall, or topography on landslide generation. Weathering is one of the important causative factor for landslide generation in the moderate topography or inactive mountainous terrain. The Western Ghats including the Deccan Traps, an inactive mountain range, receives torrential rainfall. Intense rainfall in these areas enhances the weathering processes and fabricates thick soil covers. Mahabaleshwar area, Maharashtra was chosen as a case study, where high elevated part is covered by lateritic layer and each lava flow unit is separated by a thin weathered bed of red bole. The area experiences series of landslides during the summer monsoon months. Mainly two types of landslides have been identified in the area confined with the red bole bed and powdery lateritic soil. The first type of landslides occur at higher elevations (\xe2\x89\xa51200m) where horizontal beds of permeable laterites underlined by impermeable thick basalt beds. The rain water infiltrates down and spread laterally within the permeable lateritic beds. It finally spouts at lower plateau elevations and triggers mainly debris flows. The other category of landslides occurs where the weathered red bole bed separates two successive lava flows. The percolating water from the secondary porosities (joints and inter connected vugs) comes out from the contact zones of basalt and red bole bed in the form of seepages. It erodes the red bole bed and as a result the overlying masses hang and consequently lead to rock fall. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) of the representative samples from landslide locations indicates significant weathering. The CIA values for the fine lateritic soil are up to 98% whereas for the red bole bed it varies from 77 to 85%. This suggests a high chemical weathering and higher erodibility. The association of active landslide locations with the red bole bed and fine lateritic soil suggests a close relation between weathering and landslide occurrences in the area.'

Abstract: 'India is home to thousands of community-protected forests, called sacred groves. Sacred forests or groves are sites that have cultural or spiritual significance to the people who live around them. These areas may also be key reservoirs of biodiversity. In India, most sacred groves are managed by a community group, not by a government agency. They are often private or community land, not formal protected areas or parks. This poses an interesting challenge in terms of future management and possible policy relating to the sacred groves. On the international level, organizations such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and UNESCO have created guidelines for management of sacred sites. On the national level, India\xe2\x80\x99s past Forest Acts and recent Forest Rights Act have relevance to the sacred groves. Local differences in land tenure also affect the groves. Ethnographic research conducted in 2009 and 2010 in the states of Meghalaya and Karnataka, India, evaluated the historic and current management and beliefs associated with sacred forests. Cultural change and pressure to use natural resources within the groves is leading to reduction of these forest areas. In the future, a creative combination of policy approaches to conserve groves that respects their spiritual values is recommended.'

Abstract: 'For any conservation strategy to be effective, it must be preceded by knowledge of how diversity is configured within the area of interest. Here, data from 40 savanna-grassland sites were used to examine how plant biodiversity and species composition varied across spatial scales at the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), south India. Grasslands surveyed contained 278 plant species, and were characterized by high spatial variability in species association patterns. Fourteen distinct community assemblages were identified, organized primarily along an elevation gradient in the reserve. Overall, grasslands at KMTR were characterized by the dominance of a few, widespread species. The bulk of species richness, however, resulted from subordinate species with fairly restricted distributions. At low elevations, grasslands had high species richness and species composition differed greatly between sites. Mid-elevation grasslands contained about half the number of species present at low elevations, but sites were more similar in species composition. Richness of high-elevation grasslands was a third of that found at low elevations, but different sites harbored unique sets of species. Herbivore use of grasslands varied between communities and showed patterns that coincided with elevation. Herbivore use of low-elevation communities was high albeit variable, of mid-elevation sites was consistently low, and increased at higher elevations. Tall grass communities were the least utilized by herbivores at all elevations. Most species surveyed were rare and restricted in their distribution suggesting that conservation efforts must, perforce, encompass the entire reserve. However, differences in the structuring of diversity across elevations, and in herbivore use of grasslands, suggest that conservation efforts can be partitioned differentially across locations, specifically targeting low and high elevation grasslands in the reserve.'

Abstract: 'The sal (Shorea robusta) forest vegetation of Sohagibarawa Wildlife Sanctuary, Gorakhpur, India was analysed to assess plant diversity, regeneration pattern and the status of species conservation. A total of 208 plant species representing 165 genera and 72 families were recorded. Species richness, mean density and basal area of individuals in the observed forest were compared with those of other sal-dominated forests of India. The sal forest was rich in Papilionaceae (23 species), which contributed maximally to the total number of individuals of <30 cm girth. After sal, density was maximal for a leguminous shrub, Moghania chappar. In addition to the usual recruitment by seed, a number of species also showed non-seed regeneration through storage roots, sprouts or ramet proliferation. The individuals regenerating as sprouts from underground stem or storage organs contributed significantly to the sum total of individuals/ha. As much as 45.5% of the total individuals were of ramet origin and shared 10.6% of the total species richness of the forest. In stands facing moderate to low disturbance, thickets of dense entangled mass of vegetation, predominantly composed of thorny lianas, were identified that usually contained less common and rare species like Rauwolfia serpentina, Desmodium latifolium, Crotalaria alata and Gloriosa superba in addition to the frequent ones. These thickets help to conserve the special habitat conditions and provide protection for natural regeneration of several infrequent and rare plant species and thus contribute towards the maintenance and in situ conservation of overall diversity of recurrently disturbed forest vegetation.'

Abstract: ' Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. (family Hypoxidaceae) is an endangered anticarcinogenic and aphrodisiac herb, native of India. This study reports the effect of three arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal inocula on post-transplanting performance of \xe2\x80\x98in\xc2\xa0vitro\xe2\x80\x99 raised C. orchioides plantlets. The three AM fungal inocula consisted of two monospecific cultures of Glomus geosporum and G. microcarpum and one crude consortium of AM fungal spores isolated from rhizosphere soil of C. orchioides growing in natural habitat. Complete plantlets of C. orchioides were raised by direct organogenesis of leaf explants on half strength Murashige and Skoog\xe2\x80\x99s medium devoid of any growth hormone. C. orchioides plantlets responded significantly different to all three mycorrhizal treatments. Mycorrhization enhanced the survival rate of C. orchioides plantlets to 100%. The inoculated plantlets fared significantly better than the uninoculated ones in terms of biomass production and number of leaves and roots per plant. Mycorrhizal plantlets exhibited higher concentrations of photosynthetic pigments as well as minerals P, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe in both shoots and roots. Among the three inocula tested, plantlets inoculated with the mixed consortium of AM fungi consistently performed better in terms of the parameters evaluated. The study suggests use of mixed consortium of AM fungi over monospecific cultures for the sustainable cultivation and conservation of endangered medicinal plant: Curculigo orchioides.'

Abstract: '\nWe summarize the research on Asian Sun catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma (G\xc3\xbcnther), an endemic and threatened freshwater catfish from Western Ghats of India, and provide a comprehensive review of its taxonomy, distribution, biology, population, conservation and aquaculture. Although described in 1864, the taxonomy of H. brachysoma, particularly its familial affinities, continues to be in flux. The species, originally described from the erstwhile \xe2\x80\x98state of Cochin\xe2\x80\x99 in present day Kerala State, India, has a current distribution ranging from southern Kerala (8\xc2\xb0N) to southern Maharashtra (16\xc2\xb0N), where they are found in lowland westward-flowing rivers, as well as natural freshwater lakes and backwaters. As a much relished food fish, H. brachysoma is exploited throughout its range, predominantly through an unmanaged artisanal fishery. Although there are no scientific estimates of either the status or trends in overall population of this endemic catfish, anecdotal evidence and fisher-knowledge suggests drastic declines of several local populations. The fishery for H. brachysoma in the Periyar and Achenkovil rivers in the State of Kerala has been documented to be unsustainable. As a result of an overall population decline of 35\xc2\xa0% due to overharvest and habitat loss, H. brachysoma is assessed as \xe2\x80\x98Vulnerable\xe2\x80\x99 on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\xe2\x84\xa2. Primary research on various aspects of feeding, reproductive biology and demography has generated a wealth of information on the species, but this knowledge is yet to be utilized for the development and implementation of in situ conservation or management plans. In view of its high consumer demand, efficient biological and eco-physiological characteristics, as well as the availability of a captive breeding technology, H. brachysoma is considered an emerging species for small-scale aquaculture. Priorities for scientific research to address knowledge-gaps, as well as strategies for effective conservation of this threatened freshwater catfish are discussed.'

Title: 'Biodiversity resilience in the Central Indian Highlands is contingent on maintaining and recovering landscape connectivity: the tiger as a case study'

Abstract: 'Corridors (variably called landscape linkages, connectors, and gateways) are expanses of a landscape that facilitate the flow or movement of individuals, genes, and ecological processes. Protected areas with their buffer zones and the corridors that connect them are cornerstones of modern conservation actions to maintain the biodiversity we have and restore what we have lost. Policy and governance to guide the establishment and management of protected areas and supporting buffer zones is well established in the Central Indian Highlands. A policy and governance structure to create the context and enabling conditions for corridor maintenance, creation, and recovery is emerging but is constrained by the reigning land-management paradigm that separates conservation from development rather than mainstreaming species and habitat conservation into the rural development agenda. Well-nourished, healthy human populations and healthy ecosystems are inextricably linked. The worsening ecological conditions in the Central Indian Highlands can trigger the emergence of a common agenda for an inclusive, caring, and environment-friendly mode of development. The alternative is the business-as-usual scenario: a continuation of worsening ecological conditions. Entry points through the biodiversity, agriculture production, resource extraction, and economic/social sectors to enable integrated sustainable landscape management are identified. These include deepening what it means to successfully conserve a species combined with explicit threat analysis for at-risk tigers and the landscapes that supports them; landscape scenario modeling to advance communication by synthesizing diverse forms of research and articulating and evaluating alternative socio-economic futures; and the use of the smart green infrastructure process as an approach to development rather than only as a way to mitigate environmental damage. Models are presented to scale up from isolated conservation interventions to collective impact that unites supportive government partners with individuals, NGOs, and economic interests to achieve viable long-term relationships in human and natural systems to value, maintain, and recover landscape connectivity.'

Abstract: 'This study sought to reconstruct the history of Lantana invasion and spread in India by considering two questions; (a) from where, by who, and when were Lantana species introduced into India? and (b) given its long history in the country, is it still spreading or more or less stable? We critically evaluated the archival and historical information on plant imports by the European powers into India during the period before and after British colonization. We then reconstructed the path of spread by analyzing the spatio-temporal patterns of occurrence and distribution of Lantana in India at both the national and local scale using a GIS platform. The spread of Lantana across the globe started as early as the 1690s. The European colonial powers moved the plants from Latin America to Europe and to their colonial countries in the early 1800s. Lantana species were introduced in India from 1807 onwards and thereafter the colonial powers moved this plant across the country. Following its introduction into India, the spread of Lantana across the country, either through subsequent multiple introductions from Europe to different British cantonments, or through moving the plants between cantonments within India, were reasonably rapid spanning only a few decades. In the absence of a rigorous control program, the spread of Lantana has gone on unabated and thereby impacting both wildlife and biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'We make an assessment of the impact of projected climate change on forest ecosystems in India. This assessment is based on climate projections of the Regional Climate Model of the Hadley Centre (HadRM3) and the dynamic global vegetation model IBIS for A2 and B2 scenarios. According to the model projections, 39% of forest grids are likely to undergo vegetation type change under the A2 scenario and 34% under the B2 scenario by the end of this century. However, in many forest dominant states such as Chattisgarh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh up to 73%, 67% and 62% of forested grids are projected to undergo change. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is projected to increase by 68.8% and 51.2% under the A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively, and soil organic carbon (SOC) by 37.5% for A2 and 30.2% for B2 scenario. Based on the dynamic global vegetation modeling, we present a forest vulnerability index for India which is based on the observed datasets of forest density, forest biodiversity as well as model predicted vegetation type shift estimates for forested grids. The vulnerability index suggests that upper Himalayas, northern and central parts of Western Ghats and parts of central India are most vulnerable to projected impacts of climate change, while Northeastern forests are more resilient. Thus our study points to the need for developing and implementing adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of forests to projected climate change.'

Abstract: 'Assessment of tree species diversity, structure and regeneration status of four sacred groves of Kushalnagar, southern Karnataka was carried out. The random quadrat method was employed in each grove for enumeration of tree diversity and regeneration status. A total of 98 tree species belonging to 38 families were found from the sampled areas. These groves possess higher diversity and basal area. Some 67\xc2\xa0% of species have shown regeneration, while 17\xc2\xa0% of species had no regeneration. Another 15\xc2\xa0% of species were reappearing or immigrating. It is observed that increased disturbance was directly proportional to number of reappearing or immigrating species and inversely proportional to the diversity in all the sacred groves. Significant impact on diversity, species richness and regeneration status of the flora due to manifold anthropogenic activities have been recorded.'

Abstract: '\nWild relatives are important genetic resources for crop improvement. However, basic information about their population structure, genetic diversity, species relationships and distribution of variation in a gene pool remains scanty in Vigna species. The level of genetic diversity and population genetic structure of representative accessions of cultivated and wild Asiatic Vigna species collected from diversity-rich endemic areas of India have been investigated using both microsatellite markers and morphological descriptors. Forty-one wild and 12 cultivated accessions of 13 Vigna species were genotyped using 53 polymorphic microsatellite markers. A total of 539 alleles were detected among 53 accessions at all loci with an average 10.16 alleles per locus. The major allele frequency varied from 0.16 to 0.65 (mean\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.30), while polymorphism information content of polymorphic markers ranged from 0.47 to 0.89 (mean\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.79). The UPGMA revealed five major clusters accommodating ~96\xc2\xa0% of the accessions. The largest cluster accommodated 19 (36\xc2\xa0%), while the smallest cluster had only two accessions. Two accessions, JAP/10-5 and JAP/10-9 of V. trilobata, did not group with any other accession. The model-based population structure analysis also showed almost similar pattern and grouped 53 accessions of Vigna into five genetically distinct sub-populations (K\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa05) based on maximum \xe2\x88\x86K values. Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s multiple range test revealed significant difference between five genetic and one admixture group developed through population structure analysis with 22 morphological descriptors. Analysis of variance for morphological data revealed significant difference in 12 qualitative and quantitative traits including growth habit, terminal leaflet length, colour of petiole base, petiole length, leaf senescence, length of peduncle, raceme position, calyx colour, colour of VSI pod, pod pubescence, pod curvature and 100-seed weight, indicating their significance in distinguishing population groups. The information on genetic diversity and population structure of wild and cultivated accessions of Asiatic Vigna will be tremendously useful to accelerate their use in trait improvement.\n'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats of India, one of the global biodiversity hotspots and freshwater eco-regions, harbors several fish species which not just form the important part of the world\xe2\x80\x99s freshwater biodiversity yet in addition are the vital segment of livelihood of the neighborhood population. The rate of fish decline in the Western Ghats is alarming. The absence of organized study and data scarcity on basic biology and life history traits of several species could be one reason behind the decline, and thus it is difficult to execute conservation action/s. This is especially true, particularly for data-deficient species for which definite data related to distribution, population size, and trend is not available. The present study deals with the detailed investigation of population dynamics of catfish species, Pachypterus khavalchor, which is data-deficient species inhabiting the Western Ghats of India and forms an important component of freshwater inland fishery, providing nutritional and financial security to the local community.'

Abstract: 'In order to ensure that threatened species are included in the conservation of our biological diversity, it is necessary to prioritise species and thus by landscape or implement measure for prioritised area. This requires geographical data specifying the places where threatened plants grow and the qualitative descriptions of environmental variables with which they are associated. The fundamental niche can be viewed as the set of environmental conditions and resources that allow a given species to survive and reproduce in the absence of biotic interactions. To survive and avoid competition for the same resources, a species usually occupies only a part of its fundamental niche in a particular community or ecosystem \xe2\x80\x94 that is its realized niche. Currently available floras, which provide valuable information about the species distribution pattern, do not indicate specific locations or the qualitative descriptions of environmental variables with which they are associated. In the present study realized niches of the threatened plant species of Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary were gathered using Global Positioning System (GPS) and distribution and abundance of each species were measured by stratified random sampling techniques. The realized niches of each threatened species were gathered by GPS and inductive habitat suitability assessment modelling has been done in Geographic Information System (GIS) along with environmental, edaphic, topographic and phytosociological data for their fundamental niche. The study resulted in documenting 151 tree species belonging to 51 families with eight threatened species. The distribution of each threatened species, their realized niches and its status, ecological amplitude among forest types and their geographical positions in the landscape were documented and mapped. This will lead to the exact locality information of the concerned taxa, their population status, edaphic and climatic characters of their habitat, their niche width, potential localities to be searched, knowledge of their habitat requirements; particularly the factors limiting their distributions, the factors leading to local and biological extinction and critical habitats.'

Abstract: 'In vitro techniques have found increasing use in the conservation of threatened plants in recent years and this trend is likely to continue as more species face risk of extinction. The Micropropagation Unit at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK (RBG Kew) has an extensive collection of in vitro plants including many threatened species from throughout the world. The long history of the unit and the range of plants cultured have enabled considerable expertise to be amassed in identifying the problems and developing experimental strategies for propagation and conservation of threatened plants. While a large body of knowledge is available on the in vitro culture of plants, there are limited publications relating to threatened plant conservation. This review highlights the progress in in vitro culture and conservation of threatened plants in the past decade (1995\xe2\x80\x932005) and suggests future research directions. Works on non-threatened plants are also included wherever methods have applications in rare plant conservation. Recalcitrant plant materials collected from the wild or ex situ collections are difficult to grow in culture. Different methods of sterilization and other treatments to establish clean material for culture initiation are reviewed. Application of different culture methods for multiplication, and use of unconventional materials for rooting and transplantation are reviewed. As the available plant material for culture initiation is scarce and in many cases associated with inherent problems such as low viability and endogenous contamination, reliable protocols on multiplication, rooting, and storage methods are very important. In this context, photoautotrophic micropropagation has the potential for development as a routine method for the in vitro conservation of endangered plants. Long-term storage of material in culture is challenging and the potential applications of cryopreservation are significant in this area. Future conservation biotechnology research and its applications must be aimed at conserving highly threatened, mainly endemic, plants from conservation hotspots.'

Abstract: 'The Deccan Traps or the basalts of western India are the largest exposure of basic lava flows covering about 500,000\xc2\xa0km2. Groundwater occurrence in the Deccan Traps is in phreatic condition in the weathered zone above the hard rock and in semi-confined condition in the fissures, fractures, joints, cooling cracks, lava flow junctions and in the inter-trappean beds between successive lava flows, within the hard rock. Dug wells, dug-cum-bored wells and boreholes or bore wells are commonly used for obtaining groundwater. The yield is small, usually in the range of 1\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0m3/day. The average land holding per farming family is only around 2\xc2\xa0ha. Recently, due to the ever increasing number of dug wells and deep bore wells, the water table has been falling in several watersheds, especially in those lying in the semi-arid region of the traps, so that now the emphasis has shifted from development to sustainable management. Issues like climatic change, poverty mitigation in villages, sustainable development, rapid urbanization of the population, and resource pollution have invited the attention of politicians, policy makers, government agencies and non-governmental organizations towards watershed management, forestation, soil and water conservation, recharge augmentation and, above all, the voluntary control of groundwater abstraction in the Deccan Traps terrain.'

Abstract: "This paper aims to throw light on the mass extinction that is overtaking Earth's species. Using an analytic methodology developed for an earlier partial assessment, it focuses on a series of \xe2\x80\x98hot-spot\xe2\x80\x99 areas, these being areas that (a) feature exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism, and (b) face exceptional threats of destruction. The paper identifies another eight such areas, four of them in tropical forests and four in Mediterranean-type zones. The analysis reveals that the four tropical-forest areas contain at least 2,835 endemic plant species in 18,700 km2, or 1.1 percent of Earth's plant species in 0.013 percent of Earth's land surface; and that the four Mediterranean-type areas contain 12,720 endemic plan: species in 435,700 km2, or 5.1 percent of Earth's plant species in 0.3 percent of the Earth's land surface. Taken together, these eight hot-spot areas contain 15,555 endemic plant species in 454,400 km2, or 6.2 percent of Earth's plant species in 0.3 percent of Earth's land surface. This is to be compared with the earlier hot-spots analysis of 10 tropical-forest areas, with 34,400 endemic plant species in 292,000 km2, or 13.8 percent of Earth's plant species in 0.2 percent of Earth's land surface."

Abstract: 'One-hectare plots were sampled for bird species diversity in the Uttara Kannada district. These plots represented well-preserved evergreen/semievergreen forests, secondary/moist deciduous forests showing different levels of degradation by man and plantations of teak, eucalypts and betelnut. It was found that the betelnut plantation and the evergreen/semievergreen forests had the least bird species diversity ofH\xe2\x80\xb2 = 2.58 and 2.61 respectively. The eucalypt and teak plantations hadH\xe2\x80\xb2 = 2.69 and 2-92 respectively. In the secondary/moist deciduous forests it ranged from 2.80\xe2\x80\x933.39. Despite the apparent increase in diversity in the man-modified vegetation types, it was found that there was a gradual displacement of the bird species composition from what was typical to the evergreen forests to those of more urban and scrubby habitats in these man-modified vegetation types. This was particularly so in the eucalypt plantation.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests have been recognized as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Regular monitoring of forests is necessary for an adaptive management approach and the successful implementation of ecosystem management. The present study analyses the temporal changes in forest ecosystem structure in tribal dominated Malkangiri district of Orissa, India, during 1973\xe2\x80\x932004 period based on digitized forest cover maps using geographic information system (GIS) and interpretation of satellite data. Three satellite images Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) were used to determine changes. Six land cover types were delineated which includes dense forest, open forest, scrub land, agriculture, barren land and water body. Different forest types were also demarcated within forest class for better understanding the degradation pattern in each forest types. The results showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km2 forest cover (rate of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km2 (rate of deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation, shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km2 agriculture area (1973\xe2\x80\x932004) clearly indicated the conversion of forest cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested.'

Abstract: 'Flying squirrels are capable of gliding and one of the least known mammals of the world. Work on these animals is less and sporadic due to their crepuscular and cryptic habits. At the present scenario, a complete pilot study is in an urgent need to formulate conservation strategies and policies to conserve them in India. Therefore, a thorough review on biology and conservation status of flying squirrels in India is provided here. A total of 13 species of flying squirrels present in India i.e., Belomys pearsonii, Biswamoyopterus biswasi, Eupetaurus cinereus, Eoglaucomys fimbriatus, Hylopetes alboniger, Petaurista elegans, P. mishmiensis, P. magnificus, P. mechukaensis, P. nobilis, P. petaurista, P. philippensis and Petinomys fuscocapillus, wherein three are endemic to the country. P. philippensis has broader distribution and is found to be more studied than others. Eastern part of the country contains the highest species number (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010) follows three in northern part, two in southern part and one in western part subsequently. All species are facing threat to their population due to native habitat loss, degradation and hunting. Harmonization, alliances and partnership between various stakeholders along with better application of standard techniques would be strengthen to develop conservation strategies and implementing their coordinated actions could preserve flying squirrels\xe2\x80\x99 future in the country landscape.'

Abstract: ' Gonoproktopterus curmuca is an endangered red tailed barb found in Southern part of Western Ghat, India. As a part of stock-specific, propagation assisted rehabilitation and management program, polymorphic microsatellites markers were used to study the genetic diversity and population structure of this species from the three River systems of Southern Western Ghats, such as Periyar River, the Chalakkudy River, and the Chaliyar River. From selected eight polymorphic microsatellite markers, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 8, and the average number of alleles among 3 populations ranged from 5.0 to 5.75. The mean observed (Hob) and expected (Hex) heterozygosity ranged from 0.5148 to 0.5360 and from 0.5996 to 0.6067, respectively. Significant deviations from Hardy\xe2\x80\x93Weinberg Equilibrium expectation were found at majority of the loci (except Gcur MFW72 and Gcur MFW19) and in all three populations in which heterozygote deficits were apparent. The analysis of molecular variance indicates that the percent of variance among populations and within populations were 6.73 and 93.27, respectively. The pairwise FST values between populations indicate that there were significant deviations in genetic differentiations for the red-tailed barb populations from these three Rivers of the Western Ghats, India. The microsatellites methods reported a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in the population of G. curmuca, which strongly emphasize the need of fishery management, conservation and rehabilitation of G. curmuca.'

Abstract: "Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is of central importance to combat climate change. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation's carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India's forest biomass for the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i.e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003-2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005-2007."

Abstract: 'The montane closed evergreen forests found at altitudes above 1,800 m in the Western Ghats of India possess a distinct vegetation type and are called shola forests. Despite the fact that these forests are located in relatively inaccessible areas, they are still under anthropogenic pressure leading to continued habitat degradation and loss of biomass and biodiversity. A case study was conducted in Mananvan shola, the largest shola forest in Kerala of Western Ghats, to recognize the impact of disturbance on vegetation structure, composition and regeneration pattern, to identify the socio-economic reasons for disturbance and to evolve strategies for its management. In the disturbed part of the forest, dominance of light demanding species in tree, shrub and herb communities has been recorded. Here even the dominance of exotic species in tree seedling, shrub and herb communities is prominent. Skewed girth class distribution of tree community with poor representation by the individuals of girth class 30.1 to 90.0 cm, is also an indication of the collection of small wood and poles from the forest. The RISQ (Ramakrishnan Index of Stand Quality) in the disturbed area of the forest is above 2.0 as against near to 1.0 in relatively undisturbed forest stands suggesting that the disturbance is intensive and thus natural recovery process would be slow. Socioeconomic analysis in villages located near the shola forest revealed the fact that the people depended heavily on this forest for their livelihood. Thus, the crux and the success of future management and conservation strategy depend on how one can reduce the dependency of people on the shola vegetation. Enrichment planting in disturbed parts of shola, enhancement of firewood by raising energy plantations, as well as development of lemongrass and firewood based agroforestry systems and reduction of grazing pressure by developing silvopastoral systems are the major strategies for the conservation of these shola forests.'

Abstract: 'Species richness and density of understory plants were investigated in eight 1\xc2\xa0ha plots, distributed one each in undisturbed and disturbed tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous and littoral forests of Little Andaman island, India, which falls under one of the eight hottest hotspots of Biodiversity in the world viz. the Indo-Burma. One hundred 1\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 quadrats were established in each 1\xc2\xa0ha plot, in which all the understory plants (that include herbs, undershrubs, shrubs and herbaceous climbers) were enumerated. The total density of understory plants was 6,812 individuals (851\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) and species richness was 108 species, representing 104 genera and 50 families. Across the four forest types and eight study plots, the species richness ranged from 10 to 39\xc2\xa0species\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. All the disturbed sites harbored greater number of species than their undisturbed counterparts. Herbs dominated by species (63%) and density (4,259 individuals). The grass Eragrostis tenella (1,860 individuals; IVI 40), the invasive climber Mikania cordata (803; IVI 20) and the shrub Anaxagorea luzonensis (481; IVI 17.5) were the most abundant species. Poaceae, Asteraceae, Acanthaceae, Orchidaceae and Euphorbiaceae constituted the species-rich families represented by 6 species each. The species-area curves attained an asymptote at 0.8\xc2\xa0ha level except in sites DD and DL, indicating 1\xc2\xa0ha plot is not sufficient to capture all the understory species in disturbed forests. The alien weeds formed about one-fourth of the species richness (31 species; 28%) and density (1,926 individuals; 28.3%) in the study sites, indicating the extent of weed invasion and the attention required for effective conservation of the native biodiversity of the fragile island forest ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'The last four decades have seen an increasing integration of phylogenetics and biogeography. However, a dearth of phylogenetic studies has precluded such biogeographic analyses in South Asia until recently. Noting the increase in phylogenetic research and interest in phylogenetic biogeography in the region, we outline an integrative framework for studying taxon distribution patterns. While doing so, we pay particular attention to challenges posed by the complex geological and ecological history of the region, and the differences in distribution across taxonomic groups. We outline and compare three widely used phylogenetic biogeographic approaches: topology-based methods (TBMs), pattern-based methods (PBMs) and event-based methods (EBMs). TBMs lack a quantitative framework and utilize only part of the available phylogenetic information. Hence, they are mainly suited for preliminary enquiries. Both PBMs and EBMs have a quantitative framework, but we consider the latter to be particularly suited to the South Asian context since they consider multiple biogeographic processes explicitly, and can accommodate a reticulated history of areas. As an illustration, we present a biogeographic analysis of endemic Sri Lankan agamid lizards. The results provide insights into the relative importance of multiple processes and specific zones in the radiation of two speciose lizard clades.'

Abstract: 'The members of the genus Muntiacus are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists due to their extreme chromosomal rearrangements and the ongoing discussions about the number of living species. Red muntjacs have the largest distribution of all muntjacs and were formerly considered as one species. Karyotype differences led to the provisional split between the Southern Red Muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) and the Northern Red Muntjac (M. vaginalis), but uncertainties remain as, so far, no phylogenetic study has been conducted. Here, we analysed whole mitochondrial genomes of 59 archival and 16 contemporaneous samples to resolve uncertainties about their taxonomy and used red muntjacs as model for understanding the evolutionary history of other species in Southeast Asia.'

Abstract: 'Mahseer species, the national heritage of India are globally acclaimed sport and table fish. Some mahseer species are now assessed as \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99, making it imperative to review historical and current state of knowledge on sport-related facets, taxonomy, fisheries ecology, biology, culture and conservation efforts. The review also examines the shortfalls in knowledge base and suggests issues that need to be addressed in future. The protection and conservation measures have fallen short of expectations as the pace of implementing mega-developmental projects exceeds natural recruitment rate of mahseers and lack of facilities for assisted propagation, at larger scale.'

Abstract: 'This research paper assesses the vulnerability of landslide for the Bodi-Bodimettu Ghat section, Theni district, Tamil Nadu, India, using remotely sensed data and geographic information system (GIS). Landslide database was generated using IRS-1C satellite LISS III data and aerial photographs accompanied by field investigations using differential global positioning system to generate a landslide inventory map. Topographical, spatial, and field data were processed to construct the spatial thematic layers using image processing and GIS environment. Twelve landslide-inducing factors were used for landslide vulnerability analysis: elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, proximity to road, drainage and lineament, land use/land cover, geology, geomorphology, and run-off. The first five factors were derived from digital elevation model, and other thematic layers were prepared from spatial database. Frequency ratio of each factor was computed using the above thematic factors with past landslide locations. Landslide vulnerability map was produced using raster analysis. The landslide vulnerability map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The model is validated using the relative landslide density index (R-index method). The consistency of R-index indicates good performance of the vulnerability map.'

Abstract: 'Turtles are one of the oldest groups of reptiles in the world and India has a large and diverse assemblage of extant turtles. While the North and Northeast parts of India are higher in turtle diversity, peninsular India has all the three endemic turtles. The Cane turtle and the Travancore tortoise are two endemic forest dwelling turtles. Until recently, very little was known about the ecology of these two turtles. I spent five years during my PhD studying their behaviour and ecology in the WesternGhats. In this article, I share general information on evolution of turtles and some of my findings on the behaviour and ecology of these two endemic turtles of India.'

Abstract: 'Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in southern India plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, especially of large mammals, by offering habitat contiguity of about 3300 km2 with three other protected areas in the region, namely Nagarahole and Bandipur National Parks and Wynaad Wildlife Sanctuary through forest corridors between the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats forests. The habitat linkage is crucial for large ranging animals such as elephants, which use these forest corridors for migration. Livestock grazing, a major biotic interference in forest corridors, originates from seven settlements of the Masinagudi group of villages on the eastern and the southeastern fringes of the sanctuary. Construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations, numbering about three at Singara, Marvakandy (Masinagudi) and Moyar, around the Masinagudi villages caused a rapid growth in human population (143% between 1961 and 1991), particularly the landless labourers and livestock. Free grazing by about 15 000\xe2\x80\x9317 000 resident as well as migratory livestock every year in and around the forest corridors, coupled with removal of cattle dung from the forest floor, have adversely affected the forest regeneration and helped proliferation of weed species such as Lantana camara, Casia tora, C. occidentalis, Opuntia dillenii, and Ageratum conyzoides. The annual fodder production from the corridor forest could meet the demand of about two-thirds of the resident population, while the crop residues from the marginal agriculture could not support the remaining one-third livestock population. In view of such a situation, measures have been suggested to reduce livestock population and implement the ecodevelopment packages in order to ensure the corridor connectivity for the long-term conservation of the elephant population.'

Abstract: 'India, a mega-diverse country, possesses a wide range of climate and vegetation types along with a varied topography. The present study has classified forest types of India based on multi-season IRS Resourcesat-2 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data. The study has characterized 29 land use/land cover classes including 14 forest types and seven scrub types. Hybrid classification approach has been used for the classification of forest types. The classification of vegetation has been carried out based on the ecological rule bases followed by Champion and Seth\xe2\x80\x99s (1968) scheme of forest types in India. The present classification scheme has been compared with the available global and national level land cover products. The natural vegetation cover was estimated to be 29.36\xc2\xa0% of total geographical area of India. The predominant forest types of India are tropical dry deciduous and tropical moist deciduous. Of the total forest cover, tropical dry deciduous forests occupy an area of 2,17,713\xc2\xa0km2 (34.80\xc2\xa0%) followed by 2,07,649\xc2\xa0km2 (33.19\xc2\xa0%) under tropical moist deciduous forests, 48,295\xc2\xa0km2 (7.72\xc2\xa0%) under tropical semi-evergreen forests and 47,192\xc2\xa0km2 (7.54\xc2\xa0%) under tropical wet evergreen forests. The study has brought out a comprehensive vegetation cover and forest type maps based on inputs critical in defining the various categories of vegetation and forest types. This spatially explicit database will be highly useful for the studies related to changes in various forest types, carbon stocks, climate-vegetation modeling and biogeochemical cycles.'

Abstract: 'Quantitative assessment of tree species diversity from sample plots in seven forest ranges of Nayagarh Forest Division in Odisha state in the Eastern Ghats of India was made during the period April, 2011 to November, 2013. A total of 120 transects (1000\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0m) were laid in Nayagarh, Odogaon, Pancharida, Khandapada, Dasapalla, Mahipur, and Gania forest ranges and tree stems of at least 30\xc2\xa0cm GBH were measured. The regeneration potential of trees was assessed from 5\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0m sample plots located within the main transect. A total of 177 tree species belonging to 120 genera and 44 families were recorded from the study area. Shorea robusta, Buchanania lanzan, Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia alata and Cleistanthus collinus were the predominant tree species. The stand density varied in the range of 355.33\xe2\x80\x93740.53\xc2\xa0stems\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 while basal area ranged from 7.77 to 31.62\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. The tree density and species richness decreased with increasing girth class. The highest number of species and maximum density was recorded in the girth class of 30\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm. The Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner and Simpson Indices with respect to trees with \xe2\x89\xa530\xc2\xa0cm GBH varied in the range of 2.07\xe2\x80\x933.79\xc2\xa0cm and 0.03\xe2\x80\x930.37\xc2\xa0cm respectively and the values of diversity indices are within the reported range for tropical forests of Indian sub-continent. The families, Dipterocarpaceae, Anacardiaceae, Combretaceae and Euphorbiaceae contributed to maximum species richness, stand density, and basal area. Regeneration of many tree species was observed to be poor. The present study provides baseline data for further ecological studies, forest management, and formulation of site-specific strategies for conservation of biological diversity in moist deciduous forests of Eastern India.'

Abstract: 'Information on geographic distribution, population and threat status of most globally red listed species in the Indo Burma zone are inadequate. Given the increase in the prevalence of isolated forest patches in the part of this hotspot, evaluation is necessary on how size of the remnant forest patches and on-going disturbances affects structure and diversity of remaining habitats including the population of some globally threatened tree species. Quantitative vegetation inventory by 500 m long and 10 m wide (0.5 ha) line transects were randomly set in nine fragmented tropical semi-evergreen forest patches in Tripura, Northeast India. The studied forests patches grouped into small, medium and large based on their respected sizes. Spatial variability was analysed in woody species diversity and structure along the patch size gradients and their response to both patch size and anthropogenic disturbances. Out of 167 species, 13 identified as red-listed species by IUCN under the present inventory. Most of the diversity and structural parameters showed statistically significant positive response with the forest patch size, except for stand dominance, disturbance, sapling density and number of aggregated distribution pattern decreased when patch size increased. In addition, most of the diversity and structural attributes showed negative response with disturbances. Present baseline data would serve as an effective tool for management and protection of this important forest type. Future habitat restoration programme and strategies for relocation of additional population and re-introduction of those globally threatened trees are recommended.'

Abstract: 'There is still large uncertainty over the status of global forest cover owing to the paucity of comprehensive and holistic studies related to long term forest cover change. The aim of the present work is to prepare a nation-wide multi-date forest cover database which describes and quantifies historical and recent changes in natural forests of India. This analysis facilitated the determination of the state of Indian forest cover changes over last eight decades. Here, we have mapped the total area under forest cover, evaluated the spatial tracking of changes in natural forests, estimated the rate of deforestation and afforestation, analysed the biogeographic zone wise and state wise forest cover change, existing land use in deforested area, influence of environmental factors such as terrain on deforestation and implication of different definitions of forest used by agencies reporting deforestation in India. The results indicated that forests covered an area of 869,012\xc2\xa0km2 in 1930 which has decreased to 625,565\xc2\xa0km2 in 2013, a net loss of 243,447\xc2\xa0km2 (28\xc2\xa0%) in eight decades. The highest annual average forest loss was found to be 4795\xc2\xa0km2 during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975, 1476\xc2\xa0km2 during 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 767\xc2\xa0km2 during 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, 356\xc2\xa0km2 during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 209\xc2\xa0km2 during 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. Between 1930 and 1975, forest experienced large scale deforestation at gross annual rate of 0.77\xc2\xa0% which has declined to 0.29\xc2\xa0% and 0.14\xc2\xa0% for the 1975\xe2\x80\x931985 and 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 periods respectively. Quantification of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.07\xc2\xa0% during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 0.05\xc2\xa0% during 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. The lower rates of deforestation during recent period support effectiveness of conservation measures taken at national level. It was found that deforestation rate has decreased in many biogeographic zones by 2005, except for Andaman & Nicobar Islands and North East. The major deforestation has mostly occurred due to conversion of forests to agriculture. The construction of reservoirs contributed to 4.1\xc2\xa0% of forest loss. The tropical forests have experienced large scale deforestation followed by subtropical forests. The findings of the study will be useful to prioritize conservation and protection of forest cover at the regional level. It shall also provide a base for future research on the impacts of deforestation on carbon flux and biodiversity.'

Title: 'Anthropogenic disturbances and their impact on vegetation in Western Himalaya, India'

Abstract: 'The present study assesses anthropogenic disturbances and their impacts on the vegetation in Western Himalaya, India on the basis of various disturbance parameters such as density, Total Basal Cover (TBC) of cut stumps, lopping percentage and grazing intensities. On the basis of canopy cover and frequency of disturbances (%), the studied forests were divided into highly disturbed (HD), moderately disturbed (MD) and least disturbed (LD) categories. The HD forests had the lowest canopy cover, lowest density and lowest TBC and the LD had the highest canopy cover, highest density and highest TBC. The MD forests occupied the intermediate position with respect to these parameters. Species richness was least in HD forests, highest in one of the MD forests while LD forest occupied an intermediate position. The percentage of regenerating species was lowest (54%) in HD and highest (72%) in MD. The density of seedlings and saplings was higher in one of the MD forests as compared to HD and LD. We concluded that the moderate disturbances do not affect the vegetation adversely; however the increased degree of disturbance causes loss in plant diversity; affects regeneration and changes community characteristics. Construction of hydroelectric projects at various places in the study area was found to be one of the most important sources of anthropogenic disturbances in addition to the routine anthropogenic disturbances like grazing, fuelwood collection and fodder extraction. If all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed combined with weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, it will result in a significant loss of species. Therefore, various agents of disturbances should be evaluated in cumulative manner and any developmental activities such as hydropower projects, which trigger various natural and anthropogenic disturbances, should be combined with proper cumulative environmental impact assessment and effective implementation to minimise the anticipated loss of vegetation.'

Abstract: 'The key aspect in planning and management of water resources is to analyze the runoff potential and erosion status of the river basin. For the detailed investigation of hydrological response, freely available Cartosat-1 (IRS-P5) data was used for the preparation of digital elevation model (DEM). The runoff potential and type of erosive process of 22 river basins originating in the global biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats, was inferred through hypsometric analysis. Several parameters like Hypsometric integral (HI), maximum concavity (Eh), coordinates of slope inflection point (I) given by a* and h* and normalized height of hypsometric curve (h) were extracted from the hypsometric curves and used for understanding the hydrological responses. From the hypsometric curves, the landform evolution processes were inferred. Contribution of diffusive and fluvial processes in slope degradation of the river basins was understood. Basins with lesser area (<100 km2) were found to have a positive correlation between hypsometric integral and basin area, whereas for large basins no such correlation exists. Based on the study, river basins can be prioritized for the appropriate conservation measures.'

Abstract: 'I studied ecomorphological correlations in 18 stream fish species (belonging to five families) commonly occurring in diversity rich habitats of rivers in the central Western Ghats (Southern India). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated a clear segregation of species in morphological and ecological (habitat) space. Cluster analyses using morphological features segregated species based mainly on their body shape and feeding parameters while habitat parameters segregated species according to their position along the water column and preference to runs or pool habitats. Principal component analyses showed that body size, head dimensions, mouth position and eye diameter were important characters for species segregation in morphological space while run or pool habitat type and the position of the fish in the water column best explained segregation of species in habitat space. Consistencies in some of the species clusters obtained from analyses on morphological characteristics and habitat preferences warrant closer examination of the relationships between them. These were studied employing multivariate methods like canonical correspondence analysis and the Mantel test. The tests revealed weak correlations indicating that in addition to morphology, other factors like behavioural, physiological and evolutionary constraints together are likely to play an important role in ecosystem structuring of these complex tropical assemblages.'

Abstract: 'Species composition, diversity and tree population structure were studied in three stands of the tropical wet evergreen forest in and around Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh, India. Three study stands exposed to different intensities of disturbances were identified, viz., undisturbed (2.4\xc2\xa0ha) in the core zone of the park, moderately disturbed (2.1\xc2\xa0ha) in the periphery of the park and highly disturbed (2.7\xc2\xa0ha) outside the park area. In total 200 plant species belonging to 73 families were recorded in three stands. Tree density and basal area showed a declining trend with the increase in disturbance intensity. The densities of tree saplings and seedlings were lower in the disturbed stands than in the undisturbed stand. Species like Altingia excelsa, Olea dioica, Terminalia chebula, Mesua ferrea and Shorea assamica in the undisturbed stand and Albizia procera alone in the moderately disturbed stand contributed more than 50% of the total tree density in respective stands. The undisturbed stand contained young tree population. In the highly disturbed stand, the tree density was scarce, but had uncut trees of higher girth class (>210\xc2\xa0cm GBH). Low shrub density was recorded in both disturbed stands due to frequent human disturbances; the broken canopy and direct sunlight enhanced the abundance of herbs in these stands. With a species rarity (species having <2 individuals) of ca. 50%, the tropical wet evergreenforests of the Namdapha National Park and its adjacent areas warrant more protection from human intervention and also eco-development to meet the livelihood requirements of the local inhabitants in the peripheral areas of the Namdapha National Park in order to reduce the anthropogenic pressure on the natural resources of the park.'

Abstract: 'Species diversity, population structure, abundance and dispersion patterns of all woody plants \xe2\x89\xa510cm gbh were inventoried in two 1-ha plots of tropical dry evergreen (sacred grove or temple) forests at Kuzhanthaikuppam (KK) and Thirumanikkuzhi (TM) on the Coromandel coast of south India. Site KK is a stunted forest (average tree height ca 6 m) and TM a tall forest (average tree height ca 10 m). A total of 54 species (in 47 genera and 31 families) were recorded. Species richness and stand density were 42 and 38 species and 1367 and 974 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 respectively for the sites KK and TM. About 50% of the total species were common to both the sites. Site TM is twofold more voluminous (basal area 29.48 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921) than KK (basal area 15.44 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921). Nearly one third of the individuals are multi-stemmed in the low-statured site KK whereas one fourth of the tree density is multi-stemmed in TM. Species abundance pattern varied between the two sites. The abundance of three species in KK and two species in TM is pronounced. Memecylon umbellatum, the most abundant species contributing to one third of total stand density in KK, is least represented in TM. Species richness, density and diversity indices decreased with increasing girth threshold. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 and 1-ha scales. Population structure for girth frequency is an expanding one for both the sites, except for basal area distribution in KK. Variations in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts. In the light of habitat uniqueness, species richness and sacred grove status, the need for conservation is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'Since the first report on Camptothecin detection in Nothapodytes nimmoniana by Govindachari and Viswanathan (Phytochem 11:35\xe2\x80\x9329, 1972), considerable work has been done on biotechnology and its applications on the species. Plant tissue culture techniques have applications in clonal propagation, CPT production, and conservation of N. nimmoniana. Discovery of CPT production by endophytes existing in symbiotic association with N. nimmoniana has provided new insights into finding alternative sources of the alkaloid. Development of molecular markers such as RFLP, RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP has facilitated understanding of population ecology and genetics of the species. Molecular information generated from these studies is promising in establishing strategies for conservation and sustainable use of N. nimmoniana populations under overexploitation pressure. The advances in instrumentation in the 20th century, such as desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry allowed CPT analysis in tissues without sample pretreatment. Other ancient techniques for qualitative and quantitative analysis such as chromatography, spectroscopy, and H1-NMR are applied in the detection of CPT due to variable sensitivity to the alkaloid. The review covers work on plant tissue culture for clonal propagation and CPT production in N. nimmoniana. Besides symbiotic endophyte sources of CPT in N. nimmoniana, population genetics studies and instrumentation analysis of the alkaloids are reviewed.'

Abstract: 'Aglaia bourdillonii is a plant narrowly endemic to the southern portion of the Western Ghats (WG), in peninsular India. To understand its ecological and geographic distribution, we used ecological niche modeling (ENM) based on detailed distributional information recently gathered, in relation to detailed climatic data sets. The ENMs successfully reconstructed key features of the species\xe2\x80\x99 geographic distribution, focusing almost entirely on the southern WG. Much of the species\xe2\x80\x99 distributional potential is already under protection, but our analysis allows identification of key zones for additional protection, all of which are adjacent to existing protected areas. ENM provides a useful tool for understanding the natural history of such rare and endangered species.'

Abstract: 'The study demonstrates the potential of geographical information system and statistical-based approaches to identify the hydrological processes and demarcate the groundwater prospect zones of the Gangolli basin, Karnataka State, India. The basin is situated in humid tropical climate and influenced by three major rivers viz. Kollur (6th order stream), Chakra (6th order stream) and Haladi (7th order stream) which cover an area of ~1,512\xc2\xa0km2 and cumulative length of ~84\xc2\xa0km. Various thematic maps\xe2\x80\x94drainage, geomorphology, geology, slope, soil, lineament and lineament density\xe2\x80\x94were prepared using Survey of India topographic maps, Indian remote sensing (IRS-P6) images and other published maps. Hydrogeomorphologic characteristics were correlated with different morphometric parameters to identify the hydrological processes and demarcate the groundwater potential zones of the basin. All the hydrological units and morphometric parameters were assigned suitable weightages according to their relative importance to groundwater potentiality to identify the most deficit/surplus zones of groundwater. Based on hydrological characteristics, integrated thematic maps reveal that ~14\xc2\xa0% (~217\xc2\xa0km2) of basin area falls under very good, ~32\xc2\xa0% (~486\xc2\xa0km2) under good, ~23\xc2\xa0% (~353\xc2\xa0km2) under moderate, and 30\xc2\xa0% (~443\xc2\xa0km2) under poor zones for groundwater potential. From the sub-basin-wise prioritisation, it has been inferred that SB-III scored highest groundwater potential, followed by SB-X. Result of morphometric analyses with the hydrologic parameters indicates that ~99\xc2\xa0% area of SB-III and SB-X are under very good to moderate groundwater potential zone. This study clearly demonstrates that hydrological parameters in relation with morphometric analyses are useful to demarcate the prospect zones of groundwater.'

Abstract: 'The endemic giant pill-millipedes belonging to the genus Arthrosphaera has a long history of occurrence and distribution in the Indian Subcontinent. According to the earlier and recent records, up to 40 species of Arthrosphaera are confined to southern India and Sri Lanka. Being detritus feeders, they are sensitive to narrow range of abiotic factors and their population is dwindling due to severe human interference especially landscape modification or modern forestry/agricultural practices. There is an urgent need to update the status, occurrence and distribution in distinct ecological conditions of pill-millipedes in southern India as they are important component in organic matter decomposition as well as nutrient turn over in the forests or plantations. Based on recent surveys, the present study attempts to update occurrence, distribution and morphological description (light and scanning electron microscopy) with a diagnostic key for identification of 11 species of pill-millipedes occurring in the Western Ghats of India with commentary on their distribution pattern in different ecological conditions and impact of edaphic factors.'

Abstract: "Two 25\xc2\xa0year old teak clonal seed orchards comprising 15 (CSO-I) and 20\xc2\xa0clones (CSO-II), respectively, selected mostly from moist forests of Western Ghats (latitude 10\xc2\xb0 N) in southern India, were evaluated for fertility, offspring diversity, and genetic drift. The orchards differed in fertility of clones as well as flower and fruit production per ramet. Fertility was highly skewed in CSO-II, where one clone (originating from higher latitude \xe2\x88\x9217\xc2\xb0 N, in Eastern Ghats of peninsular India) produced 55% of the fruits and 68% of the flowers in the orchard, in contrast to a similar contribution from four most fertile clones in CSO-I. Fertility variation, measured as `sibling coefficient' (1.7 in CSO-I and 8.3 in CSO-II), was high in CSO-II resulting in high coancestry and low effective population size (3 times lower than CSO-I) in the seed crop. In CSO-I, 58% of the clones contributed effectively to seed production compared to only 12% effective contribution resulting in eight times higher genetic drift in CSO-II. Placing limits on how much seed can be collected per clone might be useful in restricting over representation of highly reproductive clones thereby increasing genetic diversity in the seed crop."

Abstract: 'A study was carried out examining the effects of conservation policy on the ecosystem and livelihoods of local people on the Rajiv Gandhi National Park, located in one of the global biodiversity hotspots, the Western Ghats, India. Results show that less than 5% of the people are in favor of the policies while a staggering 94% of the people are strongly against the policies. The remaining 1% of the total respondents are found neutral with regard to conservation policies. Several reasons viz., ban on agriculture, restriction on livestock rearing and grazing, ban on non-timber forest collection, exclusion of local and indigenous communities in conservation programs and tourism activities are found to be responsible for negative attitude towards the national park. Apart from limiting the local livelihood options, the anticipated ecological consequences are not encouraging as exotic species are dominating the vegetation dynamics of the area\xe2\x80\x94replacing many native plant species. The fact is that the inextricable link between nature and society needs an integrated science-policy research approach for biodiversity conservation in the hotspots, particularly in the developing countries where human and ecosystem interactions are much more complex and closely interwoven with each other.'

A total of 66,546 accessions of legume gene resources including underutilized species are conserved in the National Gene Bank. Collection, characterization and conservation efforts regarding the diversity of these beans are described. The importance of genetic variation in legumes and their wild relatives as a source of desirable resistance to pests and diseases in a changing climate scenario is discussed. Information on legumes used in Indian and modern systems of medicine and ethno-botany as well as the scope for bio-prospecting are presented. Advanced biotechnological applications in legume research for sustainable utilization of these resources are highlighted. An integrated gene resource management strategy to combat malnutrition, identify gene resources for legume improvement and enhance their value as traditional food and medicine is described.'

Abstract: 'Axillary shoots were induced from shoot tip of Calamus thwaitesii suckers on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/L N6-benzylaminopurine and 0.1 mg/L each of thidiazuron and \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The shoots initiated were subcultured to fresh media of the same composition for shoot multiplication and multiplied shoots were transferred to half strength MS hormone-free media for shoot elongation. The elongated shoots (\xe2\x88\xbc5cm) were then re-cultured to the media supplemented with 3.0 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid/4.0 mg/L NAA to raise plantlets which were subsequently analysed for genetic fidelity using inter simple sequence repeat markers. Out of 183 bands scored, 178 bands were monomorphic indicating 97.2% similarity. The observed low level of polymorphism between genotypes supports genetic consistency of these micro-clones that are likely to be genetically true to their parental origin. The clones thus obtained were hardened in the specially fabricated mist house at 29 \xc2\xb12\xc2\xb0C and 80\xc2\xb15% relative humidity for 3 months followed by shifting to green house for another 3 months of nursery establishment. The established plants when reintroduced to the selected forest segments of the Western Ghats, Kerala (India) showed 79.3% survival rate after 2 years of field transfer. The viable and highly reproducible in vitro cloning protocol demonstrated here for the first time can be used for the production of elite female clones for aforestation activities and sustained delivery of high quality raw materials to cane processing units for strengthening cane industry.'

Abstract: 'Liana diversity was inventoried in four tropical dry evergreen forest sites that are characterized by numerous trees, of short stature and small diameter, and a varying degree of anthropogenic disturbance, on the Coromandel coast of south India. A 1-ha plot was established in each of the four sites and was subdivided into 100 quadrats of 10 m\xc3\x97 10 m. All lianas \xe2\x89\xa51 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) rooted within the plot were enumerated. The species richness and density of lianas, with respect to site disturbance and forest stature, varied across the sites. Liana density totaled 3307 individuals (range 497\xe2\x80\x931163 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921) and species richness totaled 39 species (range 24\xe2\x80\x9329 species ha\xe2\x88\x921) representing 34 genera and 24 families. Combretaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Capparaceae and Vitaceae were the well-represented families. The top five species Strychnos minor, Combretum albidum, Derris ovalifolia, Jasminum angustifolium and Reissantia indica contributed 55% of total density. The slopes of the species\xe2\x80\x93area curves were different for each of the four sites and the curve stabilized in only one site. Of the four climbing modes recognized among the total 39 species, 18 were twiners (56% of the total density). Eight species (24% of density) were tendril climbers and 12 species (16% of density) were scramblers. Hugonia mystax was the only hook climber. All the 39 species and 88% of liana density were encountered within a category of 6 cm dbh or less, and a similar pattern prevailed in the individual sites. Of the three diaspore dispersal modes found among the 39 liana species, animal (64%) and wind (23%) dispersal were predominant over the autochorous mode (13%). Liana diversity and distribution in dry forest communities appear to be influenced by forest stature and site disturbance levels. In the light of the extent of liana diversity and sacred grove status of the study sites, the need for forest conservation, involving local people, is emphasized.'

In order to develop resources for conservation genetic studies in the genus Indirana, we tested amplification success and polymorphism in 62 previously developed microsatellite loci, in eight Indirana species - including new candidate species. Developing genomic resources for this amphibian taxon is particularly important as it is endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, and harbours several endangered species.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats of Kerala have been settled over the past 40 years by landless immigrants. Natural forests and cardamom (planted under forest canopy) have been widely replaced by small-holder cultivation. Settlers plant cassava and other annuals in the initial 3\xe2\x80\x935 years following clearing of the forest canopy. These crops are gradually replaced by black pepper, the dominant crop 5\xe2\x80\x9315 years after clearing. Finally, other perennial crops, planted during the period when pepper was dominant, mature. A highly mixed \xe2\x80\x9chome garden\xe2\x80\x9d cropping phase is most common on sites 15\xe2\x80\x9320 years after the forest canopy was removed. Soil erosion on sites cleared 1\xe2\x80\x933 years previously averaged 120 t/ha in the 1988 monsoon season. Over the same period, soil erosion under mature cardamom, pepper and mixed cultivation averaged 0.65, 3.5, and 1.45 t/ha respectively. Erosion levels appear to be related to cover at ground and intermediate (1\xe2\x80\x934 m) heights above the surface. Soil organic matter is high in the cardamom areas, declines rapidly when the forest canopy is cleared, remains low in pepper, and appears to rebuild to levels as more mixed agroforestry systems become established. Overall, there appears to be a succession in which high erosion and declining organic matter levels are temporary features associated with the conversion of sites from forests and cardamom to other phases.'

Title: 'The rhetoric of participation re-examined: The state, NGOs and water users at Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India'

Abstract: "People's participation is usually regarded as a sine qua non for the success and sustainability of development projects. Yet in practice, it raises a number of questions. Who are the \xe2\x80\x98people\xe2\x80\x99? Why is their participation sought, and how or at what level, is such participation desired? This paper seeks to examine the rhetoric of participation in the implementation of the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) at Varanasi, in the north-eastern State of Uttar Pradesh, India. Launched in 1985, the GAP is the first major attempt to systematically control and monitor the pollution of a significant river in the country. In addition, it claimed to be a \xe2\x80\x98people's programme\xe2\x80\x99 because of the powerful and deep-seated cultural and religious meaning associated with the Ganga. Varanasi, however, is indicative of its failure to deliver this promise \xe2\x80\x94 the GAP is only acceptable to authority because it does not challenge the existing institutional order, and its participatory content is symbolic rather than substantive. Non-govemental organisations, traditionally viewed as intermediary actors between the micro and macro levels, work within the socio-political framework of the city. In the process, water-user groups such as the washermen who derive an economic livelihood from washing clothes in the Ganga, are literally excluded from the definition and process of \xe2\x80\x98participation\xe2\x80\x99."

Abstract: 'Due to large scale afforestation programs and forest conservation legislations, India\xe2\x80\x99s total forest area seems to have stabilized or even increased. In spite of such efforts, forest fragmentation and degradation continues, with forests being subject to increased pressure due to anthropogenic factors. Such fragmentation and degradation is leading to the forest cover to change from very dense to moderately dense and open forest and 253\xc2\xa0km2 of very dense forest has been converted to moderately dense forest, open forest, scrub and non-forest (during 2005\xe2\x80\x932007). Similarly, there has been a degradation of 4,120\xc2\xa0km2 of moderately dense forest to open forest, scrub and non-forest resulting in a net loss of 936\xc2\xa0km2 of moderately dense forest. Additionally, 4,335\xc2\xa0km2 of open forest have degraded to scrub and non-forest. Coupled with pressure due to anthropogenic factors, climate change is likely to be an added stress on forests. Forest sector programs and policies are major factors that determine the status of forests and potentially resilience to projected impacts of climate change. An attempt is made to review the forest policies and programs and their implications for the status of forests and for vulnerability of forests to projected climate change. The study concludes that forest conservation and development policies and programs need to be oriented to incorporate climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation.'

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00874416
Abstract: 'An overview of the problem of orographic effects on the southwest monsoon using the contributions of all the available analytical and numerical models is attempted. A quasi-geostrophic model is applied to deduce the effect of the topographic complex on the Indian peninsula. This model suggests that the southward bending of the low-level isobars on the peninsula can be ascribed to the topographically-induced southward velocity. This southward velocity triggers a Rossby wave to the east of the peninsula which is manifested as a trough on the southern Bay of Bengal.'

Abstract: 'Natural vegetation on the south-eastern coast of Peninsular India has now been reduced to patches, some of which are preserved as sacred groves. The plant biodiversity and population structure of woody plants (>20 cm girth at breast height; gbh) in two such groves, Oorani and Olagapuram, occurring on the north-west of Pondicherry have been analyzed. A total of 169 angiosperms have been enumerated from both sites. The Oorani grove (3.2 ha) had 74 flowering plant species distributed in 71 genera and 41 families; 30 of them are woody species, 8 are lianas and 4 are parasites. The Olagapuram grove (2.8 ha) was more species-rich with 136 species in 121 genera of 58 families; woody species were fewer (21) while 9 lianas and 3 parasites occurred. The vegetation structure indicates that the Oorani grove is a relic of tropical dry evergreen forest, whereas Olagapuram is reduced to a thorny woodland. The latter is heavily degraded as it has lost the status of a sacred grove because of its conversion to Eucalyptus plantations. The Oorani grove has an Amman temple in the centre. The attendant cultural rites and religious rituals have perpetuated the status of a sacred grove which has ensured the protection of the grove.'

Abstract: 'India is known for its rich heritage of biodiversity. In biological diversity parlance, India is one of the 17 mega-diverse countries in the world. With only 2.4\xc2\xa0% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s area, India accounts for 7\xe2\x80\x938\xc2\xa0% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s recorded plant and animal species. India\xe2\x80\x99s ten biogeographic zones possess an exemplary diversity of ecological habitats like alpine forests, grasslands, wetlands, coastal and marine ecosystems, and desert ecosystems. The large mosaic of distinct agro-ecosystems has contributed to diverse cropping pattern and systems across the country. Amongst the existing biota, 91,307 species of animals of which 2,557 Protista, 12,470 general invertebrates, 69,903 arthropods, 4,994 vertebrates, and 45,500 species of plants as well as 5,650 microbial species have been documented in its 10 bio-geographic regions. India has four out of thirty-four global biodiversity hotspots, which is an indicator of high degree of endemism (of species) in India. About 5,150 plant species and 1,837 animal species are endemic to India. India\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity includes wild relatives of agricultural crops and domesticated animals. India has 16 major types and 251 subtypes of forests. Indigenous medicine systems utilize nearly 6,500 native plants for both human and animal healthcare. India\xe2\x80\x99s diverse preponderance of native tribal and ethnic groups has contributed significantly in the conservation and diversification of biodiversity. Its cultural and ethnic diversity includes over 550 tribal communities of 227 ethnic groups spread over 5,000 forested villages. India proudly upholds the tradition of nature conservation. In 252 B.C., the Emperor Asoka established protected areas (PAs) for mammals, birds, fish and forests through a proclamation. Jim Corbett National Park covering an area of 325\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0km came into being as the India\xe2\x80\x99s first and world\xe2\x80\x99s third National Park in 1936. India has currently 4.79\xc2\xa0% of total geographic area under an elaborate network of PAs, which includes 99 National Parks, 513 wildlife sanctuaries, 43 conservation reserves, 4 community reserves and 3 biodiversity heritage sites. India has a National Wildlife Action Plan, which envisages 10\xc2\xa0% of the geographical area of the country under PA coverage. In India, the accelerated loss of biodiversity components over the last few decades has been of great concern. Environmental changes, overexploitation and habitat loss are among the major causes of species loss that, according to certain estimates, is of the order of a species per day. The richness of India\xe2\x80\x99s biological resources and related indigenous knowledge is an asset that needs to be cherished, conserved and judiciously utilized. One of the major challenges before the country lies in adopting a system which helps in utilizing this biodiversity for benefit of humankind without compromising on risking the loss. The intrinsic value of biological diversity and of the ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values and its components are to be taken care properly for the better management of biological resources and biodiversity for the welfare of human beings for better, and healthier as well as peaceful living on earth. The conservation of biological diversity is a serious and common concern of human beings for better living. The general lack of information and knowledge regarding biological diversity and of the urgent need to develop scientific, technical and institutional capacities to provide the basic understanding is important to plan and implement appropriate measures. It should be recognized that the women in rural play a vital role in the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and affirming the need for the full participation of women at all levels of policy making and implementation for biological diversity conservation. Biodiversity is an important component for economic and social development and poverty eradication and overriding priorities of most of the developing countries in the world. The conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity is critical importance of meeting of food, fodder, fiber, health, water and other needs of growing world population for which purpose, access to and sharing of both genetic resources and technologies are essential. It should be determined to conserve and sustainable use of biological diversity for the benefit of present and future generations.'

Abstract: 'This paper provides a suitable framework for consolidating knowledge and providing a useful starting point to undertake conservation of the last remnants of Butea monosperma forest. A survey was conducted to assess the status of a reportedly unexplored B. monosperma forest in a narrow strip of land along the northeastern region of Pakistan in order to conserve the remaining remnants. A preliminary reconnaissance survey on the basis of land use divides the narrow stretch of land, with concentration of remnants into four zones. The remnants were further evaluated for in situ conservation by a scoring system based on vegetation analysis and quality of habitat. Low value was assigned to those criteria which had negative impact and high to those which had positive impact on performance of B. monosperma and its long-term survival. Additional information, pertaining to decline, trends of change in the land use, and the underlying socioeconomic processes, was also made. Information from the study area indicated that, in the past two decades, the decline and conversion of the remaining B. monosperma forest to agriculture and forestry has been intensified. The vegetation analysis revealed that all remnants are broadly B. monosperma\xe2\x80\x93Adhatoda vasica, bispecies association. The scoring system ranked the remnants into four classes. Two forests from the intact remnant class and one from the mildly degraded class were recommended for in situ conservation. Keeping in view the deteriorating status of the highly ranked remnants across the landscape and the degree of alteration it is undergoing, they were assigned the conservation status category of \xe2\x80\x9ccritical.\xe2\x80\x9d An approach suggested for their immediate conservation was to fence them, with open access to the local people for sustainable resource use. In situ conservation of these benchmarks would help in further understanding the ecological, evolutionary, and structural features of this unique biogeographic ecotone and its affinities with the adjacent ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity of woody species was investigated in Ialong and Raliangsacred groves of the Jaintia hills in Meghalaya, northeast India. These grovesrepresent the climax subtropical broad-leaved forest of the area. A total of 738individuals belonging to 82 species, 59 genera and 39 families was identified ina 0.5 ha plot of the Ialong sacred grove, whereas the same area in theRaliang sacred grove had 469 individuals of 80 species, 62 genera and 41families. About 32% species were common to both groves. Lauraceae, with10\xe2\x80\x9317 species, was the dominant family. The canopy and subcanopy stratawere respectively composed of 28 and 33% of the total tree species in theforest. The number of species as well as stem density were greater for the treesof lower dbh (5\xe2\x80\x9315 cm) class compared to the higher (> 66cm) dbh class. The majority of the species showed a contagiousdistribution pattern and low frequency. The basal area varied from 57.4 to 71.4m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921.

Abstract: ' Ceropegia karulensis is an endemic and critically endangered plant of the Western Ghats from India. Exploitation of the tubers and poor regeneration from seed has narrowed distribution and propagation of the species. There is a need to develop in vitro propagation methods for C. karulensis to alleviate these problems. Here, we optimized callus induction, somatic embryogenesis and microtuberization from different seedling explants viz. cotyledonary leaf and root. The environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to observe somatic embryonic origin and their developmental stages. Highest callus proliferation was recorded with 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 6-benzylaminopurine and 1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Somatic embryos derived from cotyledonary leaf explants were more proliferative than root explants. The combination of 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 6-benzylaminopurine, 2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M naphthalene acetic acid and 7% sucrose in MS media resulted in highest microtuberization. Further, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolic profiling was carried out from native wild plants and in vitro callus tissues which identified various phytochemicals such as alkaloids, fatty acids, esters alcohols, etc. Multivariate analysis revealed the chemical disparities, where considerable variations were observed between native wild type and in vitro tissues, but no significant differences were found among in vitro callus from both root and cotyledonary explants. Overall, our results suggested that the production of various secondary metabolites found in C. karulensis was not affected by in vitro propagation and could be utilized in the conservation strategies for this plant.'

Abstract: 'UNESCO Natural World Heritage Sites (WHSs) are some of the most important biophysical and geological places on Earth, yet nearly half are endangered or face considerable risks from ever-expanding human impacts. Often sites have people living within or nearby who speak different languages, many of which are unique and similarly endangered. Here we examine the co-occurrence of Natural WHSs with languages, as a key index of cultural diversity, to identify locations for integrative conservation opportunities aimed at protecting human and non-human diversity. Our analysis reveals many WHSs with high linguistic diversity, as well as endangered sites with associated indigenous languages and endangered languages that intersect Natural WHSs. Results identify Australia as the continent which has the greatest number of Natural WHSs, many co-occurring with highly endangered languages. Engaging speakers of indigenous languages often can help maintain nature, while efforts to conserve Natural WHSs can help preserve settings that enabled indigenous languages and cultures to emerge and persist.'

Abstract: 'Natural landscapes include more than the physical elements that are typically measured and assessed. Many current sites for studies of biological diversity have long supported human history in various ways, including spiritually. As some studies explicitly query human-environment interactions, ecological research focused outside of these interactions must come to terms with people living and depending on natural resources on the landscape. Religious values promise a beneficial meeting point of human interests and natural resource conservation, where both conservationists and local communities may find similar goals.'

Abstract: 'Panna National Park is situated in the north-central part of Madhya Pradesh, India. Landscape parameters like fragmentation, porosity, patchiness and jaxtaposition have been analysed for disturbance gradient characterization. Disturbance on biodiversity due to human activities has been studied both qualitatively and quantitatively. The species richness is highest in northern mixed dry deciduous forest followed by dry deciduous open scrub and southern tropical dry deciduous teak forest. Species richness of the open thorny dry deciduous forest with grasses is found to be the lowest. Disturbance analysis indicates that 22.02% of the southern slightly moist teak forests are highly disturbed whereas Anogeissus forest and Riverine forest have 17.04% and 12.41% of the area under high disturbance, respectively. A total of 88 field sample plots were laid to enumerate trees, shrubs, herbs, climbers, etc. Biological richness parameters such as Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index, biodiversity value, ecosystem uniqueness were derived from field data. High biological richness is found in northern mixed dry deciduous forest and mixed dry deciduous forest with bamboo. More than 99% of such areas are falling under medium to high biological richness. Nearly 55% of the gentle and flat to gentle, slope categories were found to have low biological richness.'

Abstract: 'The freshwater resources of India are currently experiencing an alarming decline in fish biodiversity due to several factors and as a result, a sizeable portion of fresh water fishes have been categorized as threatened. This emphasizes an immediate need for initiating research and actions for alternative management techniques to protect these aquatic systems. One such option that has potential to protect freshwater ecosystem from numerous threats is the creation of freshwater aquatic sanctuary (FAS) within protected area network. Though similar conservation practices are well established in the terrestrial and marine ecosystem, however, the work on freshwater systems has been very slow and negligible. In the present communication we conceptualized the need and approach for developing FAS within the protected area network based on our observations in the water bodies of the selected wildlife sanctuaries in Northern India as well as success stories of some other countries. In this study we assessed the fish diversity in the selected protected areas of Northern India. The assessment indicated that these sanctuaries harbor 28.26\xe2\x80\x9331.13% of freshwater fishes, which are threatened in other areas. Apart from Indian Major Carps, Tor putitora, Chitala chitala, Pangasius pangasius, Clupisoma gerua, Ailia coila, Aorichthys aor, Wallago attu, Rhinomugil corsula, Ompok pabda, Ombok pabo etc. were the important species encountered in the protected waters. The various issues related to FAS including objectives, approach, potential tools, implementation and management are discussed towards saving endangered fish germplasm resources. Approaches, tools and modus operandi proposed in this communication could be utilized by other developing countries in the region.'

Abstract: 'An efficient system was developed for direct plant regeneration from in vitro-derived leaf explants of Embelia ribes Burm. f., a vulnerable medicinal woody climber of the Western Ghats of India. The in vitro procedure involved three steps that included induction of shoot initials from leaf tissue, regeneration and elongation of shoots from the shoot initials, and rooting of shoots. The induction of shoot initials was achieved on Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium supplemented with different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ). The best medium for shoot induction was MS with 0.272\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M TDZ. Numerous shoot primordia developed within 2\xe2\x80\x933 weeks on the leaf margin as well as on the midrib region, without any callus phase. In the second step, the shoot clumps separated from the leaf explant on transfer to MS basal medium, resulting in the differentiation of 90% of the shoot initials into well-developed shoots. The 2- to 3-cm-long shoots rooted on half-strength MS basal medium supplemented with 4.90\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 3% (w/v) sucrose in the third stage. The rooted plants could be established in soil with 70% success. This protocol could be utilized for in vitro propagation and conservation of this important threatened medicinal plant.'

Abstract: 'Physical and ecological factors such as season, rainfall, food availability, number of plant species eaten, intergroup encounters, and degree of terrestriality influence the daily path length (DPL) and home range use of animals. We examined whether these factors influenced DPL and home range use in a group of endemic lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) in the selectively logged forests of Sirsi-Honnavara in the central Western Ghats Mountains of south India. We predicted that monthly rainfall, fruit tree density, number of plant species eaten, intergroup encounters, and terrestriality would correlate with DPL, and fruit tree density, overall tree density, and richness of fruiting tree species would correlate with home range use. We collected data on feeding ecology from scan sampling, and DPL and home range use by recording the geo-coordinates of the focal group with a handheld GPS during daily follows. We obtained 1230 h of observations over 24 mo between 2008 and 2011. We collected data on the density of food species and of all trees using the point-centered quarter method in 1-ha grid cells overlaid on the home range of the study group. Results showed that the mean monthly DPL correlated positively with the number of trees fruiting in a month and negatively with rainfall. Overall tree density and fruit tree density correlated positively with habitat use. These findings support the hypothesis that primary food resources are a major determinant of primate ranging patterns. Our results are also important for lion-tailed macaque conservation, in light of the pressure the habitat has been facing. We propose conservation action to include the important food species of lion-tailed macaques for habitat restoration by the local forest department.'

Abstract: 'Consumption and processing of allochthonous plant litter by fishes is more common in tropical than temperate streams and rivers. Therefore, aquatic hyphomycetes in water (filtration), leaf litter (bubble chamber incubation), and fecal pellets (direct observation and inoculation to sterile leaf litter) of three dominant fishes belonging to the family Cyprinidae (Aplocheilus lineatus, Puntius filamentosus, and Rasbora daniconius) in two locations of the River Kali of the Western Ghats, India, were evaluated during postmonsoon season. Spores of 14 and 9 species of aquatic hyphomycetes were recovered on filtering water samples of Kaiga stream and Kadra dam with equal number of spores (32 spores \xc2\xb7 100 mL\xe2\x88\x921) and high Shannon diversity in Kaiga stream. In a bubble chamber incubation of leaf litter, 16 and 9 species were recovered from Kaiga stream and Kadra dam with high spore output (1122 versus 324 spores per mg dry mass) and high Shannon diversity in Kaiga stream. Both direct and indirect methods of examination of fecal pellets of fishes revealed more species in Kaiga stream than Kadra dam (4\xe2\x80\x937 versus 1\xe2\x80\x934 species). The spore release in leaf litter incubated with fecal pellets ranged from 2.3 to 98 spores\xc2\xb7mg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921 with the highest Aplocheilus lineatus in Kaiga stream; while in Kadra dam, it was from 0.02 to 22.9 spores\xc2\xb7mg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921 with the highest in Puntius filamentosus. The Shannon diversity of aquatic hyphomycetes was high in fecal pellets of Aplocheilus lineatus of Kaiga stream and Rasbora daniconius of Kadra dam. The top-ranked five species of aquatic hyphomycetes differed in water, leaf litter, and fish fecal pellets; however, Triscelophorus konajensis was common for all. All five top-ranked species of aquatic hyphomycetes in feces produced multicelled spores; thus, they were likely to have a better chance of viability through gut passage than single-celled spores. Preferential feeding, fungi in gut and feces, and survival and dissemination of spores by invertebrates and fishes with reference to aquatic hyphomycetes were discussed.'

Abstract: 'The principles and methods of the vegetation mapping undertaken at the French Institute, Pondicherry, are dealt with herein. Particularly, the characterisation of the different types of vegetation and especially the originality of the method: the dynamic interpretation of the vegetation and the depiction of the bioclimatic conditions. The programme of the forest map of South India at scale 1:250 000, undertaken in collaboration with the forest departments of the concerned states, is then described with special attention given to the source and the collection of data. This map has been conceived to serve as a basic document for the sustainable management of the forests. Three examples of its application are given. They concern the detection of anomalies between the existing forest cover and the prevalent climatic environment; the detection of areas for which protection is urgently needed; the selection of regions showing a particular interest in the field of nature conservation or as gene pool reserve. Finally, an example of a thematic map of sensibility of the forests is given, using the vegetation map as a basis.'

Abstract: 'By incorporating data from unofficial, non-reporting raingauge stations a list of 17 locations with an average annual rainfall exceeding 5000 mm can be compiled for Peninsular India. All stations are located along the westward exposed escarpment of the Western Ghats at a distance of not more than 100 km from the Arabian Sea. Here the superimposition of large-scale dynamic and static, location \xe2\x80\x9ccontrols\xe2\x80\x9d during the Southwest Monsoon period (June\xe2\x80\x93September) results in annual, monthly and daily rainfall amounts that are only surpassed at a few stations outside the peninsula in Northeast India. Potentials and problems of water resources development in the heavy rainfall areas are briefly discussed.'

Abstract: 'The plant\xe2\x80\x93disperser relationship and its key predictors in Indian tropical archipelagos are understudied. East of the Indian mainland (the Eastern coast, EC) are the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (AN, about 1221\xc2\xa0km away at the shortest distance), which exhibit a great plant diversity, with 848 unique species. West of the Indian mainland (the Western Ghats, WG) are another group of islands, the Lakshadweep Islands (LD, about 320\xc2\xa0km away at the shortest distance), which exhibit less diversity (102 unique species) than do the AN. We compared these two mainland\xe2\x80\x93island pairs (EC\xe2\x80\x93AN, WG\xe2\x80\x93LD), which exhibit different insular isolation conditions, to understand the plant dispersal mechanisms and their determining predictors (plant richness, geographic area, perimeter, elevation, and shortest distance). We found epizoochory (adherence to an animal surface), ornithochory (birds), and hydrochory (water) to be the dominant dispersers of both the pairs. Additionally, the plant dispersal in the WG\xe2\x80\x93LD pair is predominantly driven by anemochory (wind), possibly denoting the effects of the northeasterly trade winds. The major role of biotic dispersers in the EC\xe2\x80\x93AN pair may be explained as resulting from plant dispersal to more remote islands through biotic dispersers being more rapid and efficient. The plant commonality was found to be positively correlated with the plant richness, geographic area, and perimeter; whereas it was negatively correlated with the shortest distance and elevation of the selected mainland\xe2\x80\x93island pairs. Both linear (R2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.85) and non-linear (R2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.95) regression with maximum accuracy found island plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance to the nearest mainland pool to be the determinants in explaining plant-dispersal mechanisms. These predictors are important to maintain the habitat suitability and connectivity and thereby support more newly dispersed plants. The plant\xe2\x80\x93disperser relationship (epizoochory, ornithochory, anemochory, and hydrochory) and the key predictors (plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance) found in this study could be useful for conservation, planning, and monitoring of biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Historically the temple forests in India have served many spiritual and religious purposes. This paper stresses on the use of the underused repertoire of sacred acts to integrate the benefits of temple forests in rural development. The tree/plant species, planting design and the rituals related to their worship documented in the great epics, vedas and upanishads are of great value especially in the context of promoting forest development and the forest development led agricultural development. The Star, Planet and Zodiac forests contain a large number of native tree species ideally suited to tropical stress and drought. The promotion of temple forests would help developing forests in the upstream areas which can help create climax forests and aid in soil and moisture conservation to help improve the productivity of downstream agriculture. As the chief utilitarian value of these temple trees and plants is in terms of the native (ayurvedic) medicine, their propagation would not only develop the downsteam farming opportunities, but also promote the native medicine sector.'

Abstract: 'Seven accessions of the underutilized legume, Cassia hirsuta L., seeds collected from seven different agroclimatic regions of Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed for proximate composition, total proteins, protein fractions, mineral profiles and selected antinutritional factors. Crude protein ranged from 15.52 to 20.74%, crude lipid 3.77\xe2\x80\x937.04%, crude fiber4.68\xe2\x80\x936.92%, ash 3.98\xe2\x80\x936.42% and carbohydrates 62.45\xe2\x80\x9370.16%. Energyvalues of the seeds were 1549\xe2\x80\x931634 kJ/100 g (DM), which are comparable to those of other legumes. Data on seed protein fractions revealed thatglobulins constituted the bulk of the seed protein as in most legumes. Mineralcontents of the seeds showed greater variation. Potassium was the mostabundant mineral (1029\xe2\x80\x931786 mg/100 g), whereas manganese was low (2.1\xe2\x80\x932.2 mg/100 g). Antinutritional factors such as total free phenolics,tannins, L-DOPA and lectins were analyzed. The results of the studydemonstrated that the accessions of C. hirsuta seeds collectedfrom Tamil Nadu, India, could be good sources of some important nutrientsfor humans.'

Title: 'Future of wetlands in tropical and subtropical Asia, especially in the face of climate change'

Abstract: 'Tropical and subtropical Asia differs from other tropical regions in its monsoonal climate and the dominant influence of the Hindukush and Himalayan mountain ranges which result in extremes of spatial and temporal variability in precipitation. However, several major rivers and their tributaries arise in the Himalayan ranges and are fed by thousands of glaciers. Huge sediment loads carried by these rivers result in important deltas at their mouths. The climatic and physiographic diversity have endowed the region with many kinds of wetlands. Of these, the peatswamps of southeast Asia constitute about 56% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s tropical peatlands, and more than 42% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s mangroves occur in South and southeast Asia. Among other wetlands, riverine swamps are rather restricted whereas the seasonal marshes are a dominant feature. Another characteristic feature of tropical Asia are the innumerable human-made and intensively managed wetlands of which the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds are the most extensive. Throughout tropical Asia, wetlands have been a part of the socio-cultural ethos of the people and many communities have lived in wetlands. However, the pressures of high population and the economic development have extensively impacted upon wetlands which have been transformed for paddy cultivation and aquaculture, drained and converted to other land uses for economic gains (e.g., conversion to oil palm), and degraded by discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. Invasive plant and animal species have also played a significant role. The climate change is already being felt in the rapid retreat of Himalayan glaciers, increased temperature and variability in precipitation as well as the frequency of extreme events. Sea level rise is seen as a major threat to the coastal wetlands, particularly the mangroves. Increasing droughts have caused frequent fires in Indonesian peat swamps that have further feedback impacts on regional climate. However, the actual threat to wetlands in this region arises from the extensive hydrological alterations being caused by storage, abstraction and diversion of river flows for agriculture, industry and hydropower. Currently, the state of our understanding wetlands in general, and the efforts and infrastructure for research and training in wetlands are very poor. Although a few wetlands have been designated as Ramsar sites, the policies aimed at wetland conservation are either non-existent or very weak. Human responses to greater uncertainty and variability in the available water resources in different parts of Asia will be crucial to the conservation of wetlands in the future.'

Abstract: 'With growing human and, possibly, elephant populations and a drastic increase in anthropogenic activities, human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict in Asia has been on the rise. The Alur area in Karnataka state, southern India, is one such case in point, which has witnessed increasing levels of human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict over the last two decades. The tiny, moderately protected habitat available for elephants in this human-dominated landscape does not appear to be able to support elephants over the long term. Options to deal with the escalating conflict include translocation of elephants, bringing elephants into captivity, and culling. We carried out a molecular genetic study of elephants in the Alur area to estimate the minimum number of elephants using the area, the sex ratio, genetic relatedness between individuals, and genetic structure with regard to the larger population in the landscape, so that informed management decisions could be made. Fresh dung samples were collected from the field and genotyped using 12 microsatellite loci. We found 29 unique individuals in the population, comprising 17 females and 12 males of different age classes. Relatedness between females suggested independent colonisations by discrete, small groups rather than by one cohesive clan of related females. This obviates the need for a single solution for dealing with all the females in the area in order to maintain social integrity, and has implications in terms how these elephants can be dealt with. We demonstrate how social organization inferred through molecular data from non-invasive sampling can inform management decisions.'

Abstract: 'Extensive surveys were conducted to explore the diversity of fishes, distribution patterns, abundance, threat, and habitat status in the upper, middle, and lower stretch of river Gomti, a tributary of river Ganga. Altogether 56 fish species belonging to 20 families and 42 genera were collected from various sampling sites. Of the 56 species, five belong to the \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (EN) category and 11 belong to the vulnerable (VU) category. Six major categories of habitat were identified and pattern of fish assemblage and dominant genera in each habitat studied. Considerable differences were observed in the fish species richness and relative abundance (RA) of the species in the different sampling sites of river Gomti. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener biodiversity index has been calculated for the fishes indicating considerable variation (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) across the river. Apart from Indian Major Carps (Labeo rohita, Catla catla, Cirrhinus mrigala), Chitala chitala, Notopterus notopterus, Ompok pabda, O. bimaculatus, Labeo bata, L. calbasu, Cirrhinus reba, Channa marulius, Bagarius bagarius, and Clupisoma garua were the important species. All the species have been reported for the first time in this river. Indiscriminate catch, poisoning, using of fine mesh sized nets, dumping of sewage, siltation, water abstraction, changing land use pattern, decreased water discharge, and exotic species threaten the fish diversity. Urgent need exists for taking up research on the priority fish species and their habitat. Restoration measures have been proposed based on ecosystem scale approach for fish biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'Logging and forest loss continues to be a major problem within Southeast Asia and as a result, many species are becoming threatened or extinct. The present study provides the first detailed and comprehensive ecological data on the Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), a primate species living exclusively on the island of Siberut off the west coast of Sumatra. Our results show that M. siberu is ecologically similar to its closest relative M. nemestrina occurring on the mainland, both species being semi-terrestrial, mainly frugivorous (75-76%), exhibit a large daily travel distance for their group size and spend more time on traveling than any other macaque species. The habitat of Siberut macaques was floristically very diverse (Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index D=0.97), although somewhat impoverished in tree species richness, and had a lower tree basal area and a lower rattan density compared to other forests in Malesia (both rattan and palm tree fruit being an important food resource for Macaca siberu due to their long fruiting periods). These factors may lead to a lower diversity and abundance of fruit resources, and coupled with a high degree of frugivory of Siberut macaques, may explain the large amount of traveling observed in this species. The large home range requirements and strong dependence on fruit are important factors that need to be considered when developing conservation measures for this IUCN-listed (Category Vulnerable) species.'

Title: 'Extraction of non-timber forest products in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. 2. Impact of NTFP extraction on regeneration, population structure, and species composition'

Abstract: 'Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has recently gained considerable attention as a means to enhance rural incomes and conserve tropical forests. However, there is little information on the amounts of products collected per unit area and the impact of extraction on forest structure and composition. In this paper we estimate the quantities of selected products gathered by the Soligas, the indigenous people in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) sanctuary in Karnataka, India, and examine the effect of extraction on forest structure and composition. Two sites, distant (DS) and proximal (PS), were identified based on the proximity to a Soliga settlement. The frequency of different size classes indicates that regeneration overall is poor in the area. The two sites show differences in species richness, basal area, and tree mortality. Furthermore, non-timber forest product species show a greater deficit of small size classes than the timber forest species, suggesting that regeneration is affected by collection of seeds and fruits from non-timber forest product species. Regeneration, however, may also be affected by other anthropogenic pressures such as fire, grazing and competition with weeds.'

Abstract: 'In the present study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method namely inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) was employed to assess genetic stability in tissue culture-derived Dictyospermum ovalifolium plantlets. To study genomic stability of micropropagated plants, 14 individuals were randomly tagged among a population of 2500 regenerants and were compared with single donor mother plant. A total of 51 clear and reproducible bands ranging from 200 bp to 2.1 kb were scored corresponding to an average of 3.64 bands per primer. Two of the 51 bands were polymorphic (3.92 %) among 14 individuals, thus indicating the occurrence of low level genomic variation in the micropropagated plants. Cluster analysis indicates that genetic similarity values were 0.978 which allows classification of the plants to distinct groups. Further an attempt was made to reintroduce the micropropagated plants into their natural habitat. Over one thousand six hundred fifty plants were successfully established.'

Abstract: 'Freshwater ecosystems and associated habitats harbor incredible biodiversity. They offer various ecosystem services and sustain human livelihoods. However, due to increasing developmental pressure and rising water demand, these systems are under huge threat. As a result, many aquatic species are feared to become extinct in near future. Quantifying the patterns of aquatic species diversity and composition of river systems is urgently required. With this interest, we studied four river systems in the Western Ghats region, documenting the pattern of fish diversity and identifying the factors that influence fish species richness. Maintaining undisturbed streams and river basins, especially headwater regions is crucial for sustaining freshwater biodiversity in the tropical river ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'A multi-thematic analysis based on different physical factors has been adopted to generate integrated maps on erosion proneness as well as on critical slope under a GIS platform for terrain evaluation. This spatial data on erosion proneness has demonstrated that 17.62 km2 area, out of the 140 km2 in the catchment zone, needs careful attention for ecorestoration. In the critical slope map four land stability classes have been demarcated. The area represented as Unstable and Moderately-stable is found to be important for slope stability problems. Temporal change in the drainage network over a period of four decades as well as the extent of loss in the perennial status of tributaries have been recorded to evaluate the landform changes. A catchment treatment plan has also been suggested.'

Abstract: 'This study examined the impact of disturbance on the pattern of diversity, forest structure and regeneration of tree species in the Vindhyan dry tropical forest of India. A total of 1500\xc2\xa0quadrats distributed over five, 3-ha permanent plots in five sites, differing in degree of disturbance, were used to enumerate and measure the tree species. A total of 65 species with 136,983 individuals were enumerated in the total 15-ha area for stems \xe2\x89\xa5 30\xc2\xa0cm height. The number of species and number of stems ranged from 12 to 50 and 8063\xe2\x80\x9365331\xc2\xa0per 3-ha area. The number of species and stems for trees \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh ranged from 3 to 28 species, with a mean value of 16 species ha\xe2\x88\x921, and from 16 to 477 stems, with a mean value of 256 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The adult based PCA ordination indicated uniqueness of sites in terms of species composition and habitat characteristics. PCA ordination also showed uniqueness of sites in terms of seedling composition, but the seedling and adult distributions were not spatially associated. The distinct species composition at the different sites and at the two life-cycle stages on the same site is indicative of marked spatio-temporal dynamics of the dry tropical forest. The density\xe2\x80\x93diameter semi-logarithmic curves ranged from a near linear to an overall concave appearance with a limited plateau in the mid-diameter ranges. The \xce\xb1-diversity and its components decreased with increasing disturbance intensity, reflecting enhanced utilization pressure with increasing disturbance. The site-wise and species-wise regression analyses of the number of individuals in different stages of the species revealed that both the level of disturbance and the nature of species strongly affect the regeneration. In conclusion, although the forest is relatively species-poor, the differential species composition on different sites and the temporal dynamics lend a unique level of diversity to the tropical dry deciduous forest.'

Abstract: 'A potentially diagnostic 18S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) gene was amplified reliably from red-listed ethnomedicinal species of Myristica and its wild and related genera. Individuals from nine species of Myristicaceae were utilized for the study. The sequences ranged from 1,767 to 1,794 nucleotide (nt) in length. The GC content (%) varied from 52.77 to 51.04. The frequencies (%) of nt were A (23.31), T (23.82), C (24.48) and G (28.39). The alignment of all sequences produced 195/1,516 variable sites and 1,257/1,516 conserved sites. Total numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites found in the alignment were 146/1,516. Knema andamanica (Warb.) W.J. de Wilde was the most distinct that included 18 variable regions and 15 InDel with 27 SNP sites, specific to this species. The identified regions from nine species of Myristica and its wild and closely related genera were deposited in the GenBank Database (Accession numbers JN228257-JN228265). Comparison of morphological identifications and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the specimens were correctly assigned on the basis of a short stretch of 18S rDNA (~1,600\xc2\xa0bp) making this a potentially useful marker for the rapid molecular assignment of an unknown related species also. Significant sequence homology ranging from 72 to 99\xc2\xa0% was observed on comparison with 18S rDNA genes of other plants in the public domain. A comparison of intraspecific data information of nine 18S with that of 73 matK and 86 rbcL sequences from GenBank revealed that polymorphism, divergence and conservation is higher in 18S locus for Myristicaceae. Hence these markers may be utilized for phylogenetic analysis, evaluation of species richness during ecological surveys or for environmental assessments. These molecular markers are especially important due to the fact that the species studied are mostly vulnerable and red-listed with limited availability in endangered ecological niches.'

Abstract: 'The process of forest fragmentation, a common phenomenon occurring in tropical forests, not only results into continuously forest getting fragmented but also brings about several physical and biological changes in the environment of forests. Consequently, there is a loss of biodiversity due to change in habitat conditions. These remnant fragments provide the last hope for biodiversity conservation. The present study deals with the impact of decreasing patch size of a fragmented forest on the diversity of the tropical dry deciduous forests in Vindhyan highlands, India. There is considerable change in the vegetation cover of this region owing to rapid industrialization and urbanization, which has also contributed to forest fragmentation. In the present study, remotely sensed data has been used to describe the changes brought about in vegetated areas over a period of 10\xc2\xa0years as a result of fragmentation and its impact on biodiversity was assessed. Further, in order to assess the loss of species with respect to the reduction in patch size, species area curves for various change areas were analysed. It was observed that the rate of decrease in the number of species is faster in the case of negative change areas as compared to the positive change areas of the region. Various diversity indices also support this observation. Such an analysis would help in formulating appropriate conservation measures for the region.'

Abstract: 'Recent years have witnessed a rise in sensitivity towards protection of natural genetic resources and the environment at the international level. This is evident from the implementation of the convention on biodiversity (CBD). To conserve and optimize utilization of its bioresources, India enacted the Biological Diversity Act 2002. The conservation and management of aquatic resources is important for sustainable utilization of fisheries potential for the economic advancement of farmers and fishery workers, today as well as for posterity. As the biotechnological and genomic revolutions are ready to take off, the sovereign rights of native inhabitants to intellectual property rights (IPR) related to aquatic genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge are also integral components of management strategies for genetic resources.'

Abstract: 'A large number of economically disadvantaged people live around protected areas. Conservation efforts that focus on poverty alleviation, work on the premise that an increase in household wealth decreases use of forest resources. We surveyed 1222 households across four tiger reserves to test the paradigm that an increase in assets leads to reduced forest use and we also assess the effects of other socio-economic factors. We find that increase in assets may reduce Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) collection, but may not necessarily reduce livestock numbers or use of wood as a cooking fuel. Households that faced more economic setbacks were more likely to state that they wanted more livestock in the future. Education is positively associated with choosing Liquefied Petroleum Gas as a cooking fuel in the future. We find site and resource-specific variation. Fifty percent of all households (range across sites: 6\xe2\x80\x9398) want to collect NTFP while 91% (range: 87\xe2\x80\x9396) want to retain or own more livestock over the next 5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0years. Understanding current and future resource use will help plan context-specific conservation efforts that are better aligned with reducing specific pressures around protected areas.'

Abstract: 'Whereas much attention is paid to the conservation and management of threatened species of primates, little work is reported on the species that are at lower risk. We report data on demography and population dynamics in commensal bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata radiata) sharing human habitats in Intensive Cultivation, Dry Cultivation and Scrub Forest zones around the city of Mysore, south India. We also compare the data with the previous data collected in 1989 and 1998 on the same groups by our research team. The population has suffered an overall decline of 21.3% (at an intrinsic rate (r) of \xe2\x88\x920.017) with Dry Cultivation habitat alone recording over 41% decline (r=\xe2\x88\x920.038) in 14 years. The Dry Cultivation habitat has also shown increased population fragmentation due to increased distance among groups, and decreased numbers of individuals per subpopulation. In Dry Cultivation areas, the number of small groups has been increasing, whereas the number of medium and large groups has been decreasing. We discuss such trends in the context of human-monkey conflict for shared resources. We propose that effective conservation strategies for lower risk species, especially if they are by-and-large commensal, must be planned now before they become threatened. We further propose that Scrub Forests with places of worship, and with the least human-monkey conflict but otherwise close to intensively used human habitats, are the most suitable and stable habitats for conservation of bonnet macaques.'

Abstract: 'Focal species are valuable tools for evaluating management practices for biodiversity conservation. Butterfly gardening through the creation of appropriate habitats can be a primary conservation tool to increase species abundance and richness and gene flow among the populations in fragmented landscapes. In this context, the role of butterfly gardens in the conservation of butterfly populations and the seasonal population trends of swallowtail butterflies (family Papilionidae) sighted in the Butterfly Safari Park at Thenmala were studied. A total of 4760 sightings of 15 species of swallowtails belonging to five genera were recorded, of which six were endemic species, three species had protected status and two were rare species. It is worth noting that of the 19 species of the papilionids recorded in Kerala, as many as 15 species were recorded in Thenmala. Of the various species recorded, Troides minos, Pachliopta pandiyana, Pachliopta aristolochiae, Graphium agamemnon, Graphium sarpedon, Papilio polytes, Papilio clytia, Papilio demoleus and Papilio polymnestor comprised the resident populations, while species such as Atrophaneura hector, Papilio helenus, Papilio dravidarum, Papilio paris, Papilio liomedon and Graphium nomius were found only during certain seasons. The overall butterfly abundance was high from August to November. The butterfly populations exhibited a gradual decline in numbers from December onwards with the onset of dry seasons. The abundance of butterfly populations was low during March\xe2\x80\x94April. The abundance of T. minos, P. pandiyana, P. polymnestor, P. paris, P. dravidarum, P. helenus, P. polytes and P. liomedon showed a significant negative correlation with monthly average temperature and a significant positive correlation with humidity.'

Abstract: 'We examined demographic consequences of habitat fragmentation in the lion-tailed macaque in the Anamalai Hills in southern Western Ghats. The parameters examined were group size, age/sex composition, and birth rate, in relation to various habitat parameters. Demographic parameters were estimated for 11 groups in 8 rain forest fragments, during January to May 1996. Area, tree density, canopy cover, canopy height, and tree basal area were estimated for these fragments. As fragment area decreased, there was a decline in birth rate and proportion of immatures in the group, and an increase in the number of adult males, and the variability in group size and adult sex ratios. A similar pattern was also observed with decreasing values of other habitat variables. Differences in the founder population size and age structure, demographic randomness, and history of poaching have caused greater variability in group size and adult sex ratios in the small fragments. The lack of dispersal in the small fragments is another reason for the high variability.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats constitute one of the three biodiversity hot spots in India, which is under constant threat from various quarters. Among the several anthropogenic causes, fire is one of the important anthropogenic factor, which plays a pivotal role in vegetation succession and ecosystem processes. It is very important to understand the ecological changes due to fire and other anthropogenic factors for conservation and management of biodiversity. Because of its synoptic, multi-spectral and multi-temporal nature remote sensing data can be a good source for forest fire monitoring. In the present study, an effort has been made to monitor the burnt areas using March 2000 and 2004 IRS LISS \xe2\x80\x94 III data. The study revealed that an area of 2.15 km2 and 4.46 km2 was affected by fire in 2000 and 2004 respectively. Repeated drought, followed by mass flowering and dying of bamboo accelerated the spread of fire from ground to canopy in areas with high bamboo density.'

Abstract: 'We assessed the diversity of woody plants at 15 forested sites in the Tansa Valley of Thane District, in Maharashtra, India. The fewest species (11) were seen at a degraded mangrove site near the river mouth, and the greatest number (150) in the rich semi-evergreen forest on Tungar Hill. For all sites there were 141 tree, 25 shrub and 15 liana species, a total of 181 species. Excluding the mangrove site, which had no species in common with the other 14 sites, we analyzed the species distributions in detail. These sites ranged in area from 4 to 30 km2 each, had woody floras of 89 \xc2\xb1 6 species, and varied in intensity of human impact. Despite a history of exploitation and substantial reduction in biomass from firewood collecting, set fires and illicit tree felling, considerable plant diversity remains in the area. We found a modest increase in species richness in transects away from two villages. We observed the exploitation of the forest by the principal users, primarily of the Warli Tribe. They exploited a wide variety of forest resources (92 species), for medicines, foods, construction materials, household goods, manure and other purposes. They collected 15 items for sale. By far the single most important item collected was firewood, which dramatically reduced forest biomass within 2 km of villages. The species distributions in these forest remnants are strongly nested, mostly due to varying degrees of disturbance at individual sites. The high species diversity on Tungar Hill is most likely a relict of the earlier character of forests throughout much of the valley. It merits the highest priorities for preservation, as a refuge for Western Ghat species at the northern limits of their distributions.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity conservation requires prioritization of areas for in situ conservation. In that perspective, the present study documents the global diversity of a component of the soil macrofauna, the land planarians, and concerns an exploratory analysis of their possible role as indicators of biodiversity. Diversity is described by three quantitative methods: (1) hotspots of species richness, selecting areas richest in species, (2) hotspots of range-size rarity, identifying areas richest in narrowly endemic species, and (3) complementarity, prioritizing areas according to their greatest combined species richness. The biodiversity measures of species richness and range-size rarity show a great correspondence in the identification of hotspots of diversity; both measures identify the following seven areas as the most biodiverse for land planarians: Sao Paulo, Florianopolis, western Java, Tasmania, Sri Lanka, North Island/New Zealand, and Sydney. It is discussed to what extent the results for the land planarians correspond with those obtained in other studies that assessed biodiversity hotspots for taxa on a global scale. It is noteworthy that land planarians identify a few global hotspots of diversity that generally do not feature, or only have low rankings, in other studies: New Zealand, southeastern Australia, and Tasmania.'

Abstract: 'The use of paddock trees by birds was assessed in a grazinglandscape in southern New South Wales, Australia. Seventy paddock treesites were surveyed for 20 min each in the morning, and 36sites were surveyed again at midday in March 2000. During this time, thepresence and abundance of birds was recorded. Several site and landscapevariables were measured at each site. These included tree species, atree size index, a measure of the crown cover density around the site,and proximity to the nearest woodland patch. During formal surveys, 31bird species, including several woodland species, were observed usingpaddock trees. Data from bird surveys in woodland patches that wereobtained in a separate study in November 1999 were used to comparewhether there was a relationship between the abundance of a given birdspecies in woodland patches and paddock trees. Many birds commonlydetected in woodland patches were also common in paddock trees. However,some birds with special habitat requirements were absent from paddocktrees although they were common in woodland patches. Site occupancypatterns were modelled for several guilds of birds using logisticregression. Foliage-foraging birds were more likely to occupy clumps oftrees and sites with a high tree size index. Nectarivores appeared to bemore likely to be detected at sites more than 200 m fromwoodland, although this result was marginally non-significant(P = 0.08). The probability of detecting granivoreswas higher at sites with a low tree size index. Open country specieswere most likely to occupy large trees and sites that were located morethan 200 m from the nearest woodland patch. The value ofpaddock trees may have been underestimated in the past because a widevariety of bird species use paddock trees on a regular basis. Ensuringthe continued survival of paddock trees should be an important aspect offuture conservation and revegetation efforts.'

Abstract: 'Aapravasi Ghat is a World Heritage property and represents the mass immigration of Indentured Laborers after slavery. The Indenture Labor System started in 1834 but the site was established as a permanent immigration depot in 1849. For about a century the depot was used for arrival and departure of indentured laborers from Asian and African countries. Archaeological investigations highlighted the space distribution and everyday functioning of the depot. Simultaneously, structural modifications made before, during and after its occupation as a depot, could be identified. This paper relates the findings made through historical archaeological research and reconstruct the site during the different time period while focusing on the indenture period.'

Abstract: 'Hill areas form one of the most fragile ecosystems vulnerable to all kind of human influences. Low productivity of hill lands and rampant poverty among the hill population call for adequate attention to be given towards sustainable development of land and water resources of the hill areas. Remote sensing offers one of the most viable technological solutions for generating data on natural resources of an area. The Geographical Information System technology offers an appropriate method for integrating the land and water resources information and for identifying agroclimatically coherent zones for suggesting locale specific prescriptions and treatment packages. In the present study using capabilities offered by the satellite remote sensing and geographical information system technology an attempt has been made to develop and suggest sustainable development plan for the hill areas of Sakaleshpur and Alur taluks of Hassan district (approx. 1466 sq km area) of the Karnataka state. Integrated analysis of factors such as topography, rainfall pattern, landuse practices, status of natural resources (wastelands, soils, forest, water resources, etc.) land capability and environmental factors concerning the area has been carried out to suggest development plan for the study area. A set of 11 thematic maps (on 1\xe2\x88\xb650,000 scale) have been prepared using remote sensing data and topomaps and compiled in the form of an atlas. Landuse statistics obtained from remote sensing data has been compared with the conventional landuse statistics reported by the State Department of Economics and Statistics and both are found to be in good agreement with each other (within\xc2\xb17 percent).'

Abstract: 'Simulation of moist convective processes is critical for accurately representing the interaction among tropical wave activities, atmospheric water vapor transport, and clouds associated with the Indian monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation (ISO). In this study, we apply the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate Indian monsoon ISO with three different treatments of moist convective processes: (1) the Betts\xe2\x80\x93Miller\xe2\x80\x93Janji\xc4\x87 (BMJ) adjustment cumulus scheme without explicit simulation of moist convective processes; (2) the New Simplified Arakawa\xe2\x80\x93Schubert (NSAS) mass-flux scheme with simplified moist convective processes; and (3) explicit simulation of moist convective processes at convection permitting scale (Nest). Results show that the BMJ experiment is unable to properly reproduce the equatorial Rossby wave activities and the corresponding phase relationship between moisture advection and dynamical convergence during the ISO. These features associated with the ISO are approximately captured in the NSAS experiment. The simulation with resolved moist convective processes significantly improves the representation of the ISO evolution, and has good agreements with the observations. This study features the first attempt to investigate the Indian monsoon at convection permitting scale.'

Abstract: 'This special issue is dedicated to the in vitro tools and methods used to conserve the genetic diversity of rare and threatened plant species from around the world. Species that are on the brink of extinction because of the rapid loss of genetic diversity and habitat come mainly from resource-poor areas of the world and from global biodiversity hotspots and island countries. These species are unique because they are endemic, and only a few small populations or sometimes only a few individuals remain in the wild. Therefore, the challenges to support conservation by in vitro measures are many and varied. The editors of this invited issue solicited papers from experts from Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, and North and South America. This compilation of articles describes the efforts in these diverse regions toward saving plants from extinction, and details the direct application of in vitro and cryopreservation methods. In addition, these contributions provide guidance on propagation of rare plants, including techniques for large-scale propagation, storage, and reintroduction. The in vitro techniques for conserving plant biodiversity include shoot apical or axillary-meristem-based micropropagation, somatic embryogenesis, cell culture technologies and embryo rescue techniques, as well as a range of in vitro cold storage and cryopreservation protocols, and they are discussed in depth in this issue.'

Abstract: 'Rhesus and bonnet macaques are the 2 most common and widely distributed of the 8 macaque species of India. Rhesus macaques are widely distributed across southern and southeastern Asia, whereas bonnet macaques are restricted to peninsular India. We studied the current distributional limits of the 2 species, examined patterns of their coexistence in the interspecific border zones, and evaluated losses in the distributional range of bonnet macaques over the last 3 decades. Our results indicate that whereas rhesus macaques have extended their geographical range into the southern peninsula, bonnet macaques have been displaced from many areas within their former distributional range. The southern and the northern distributional limits for rhesus and bonnet macaques, respectively, currently run parallel to each other in the western part of the country, are separated by a large gap in central India, and converge on the eastern coast of the peninsula to form a distribution overlap zone. This overlap region is characterized by the presence of mixed-species troops, with pure troops of both species sometimes occurring even in close proximity to one another. The range extension of rhesus macaque\xe2\x80\x94a natural process in some areas and a direct consequence of introduction by humans in other regions\xe2\x80\x94poses grave implications for the endemic and declining populations of bonnet macaques in southern India.'

Abstract: 'The paper discusses the advantages aerial photographs offer for a quick appraisal of geomorphic surfaces in a terrain of low to moderate relief, high vegetative cover with considerable human activities. The area studied comprises the coastal tracts between Calicut and Ernakulam and the midlands immediately to the east. Two morphological units, namely the costal plain and uplands constitute the terrain between the Western Ghats and the sea. The costal plain from west to east comprise a narrow beach, a younger beach ridge plain, an older beach ridge plain and lateritic surface, generally plateau shaped with gentle to moderate slopes, terraced, dendritically dissected and with insignificant development of pediment. Further eastwards, the areas of high relief consists of hard crystalline rocks laterised at the top.'

Abstract: 'Climate change enhances invasive species distribution by altering species composition in native ecosystems. Here we assessed harmony in plant invasions of two perennial exotic species of similar origin and naturalised in India, i.e., Chromolaena odorata and Tridax procumbens. Predictions made for the current condition was subsequently projected for the years 2050 and 2100 for both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) was applied to assess their habitat suitability, risk area identification and shifts in range sizes. The distribution of C. odorata could mostly depend on temperature and moisture availability; and invade the biodiversity-rich regions of India viz., the Eastern Ghats, the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalaya and the north-eastern regions. The prevalence of T. procumbens in central regions of India could demonstrate its greater dependencies on precipitation seasonality and radiation than that on temperature. These discrepancies in climatic dependencies allowed both for a harmonious distribution, i.e., inhabiting in regions not utilised by other. Both are likely to reduce their potential distribution areas in the future climate, where moisture availability is a key factor for their range expansion. The capacity to tolerate a wide range of temperature and solar radiation allowed T. procumbens to manage climate change impacts more efficiently, compared with C. odorata. The present study reveals harmony in their distributions and suggests distinct conservation protocols for each of them to control their invasion risks.'

Abstract: 'This study focuses on the assessment of the status of world\xe2\x80\x99s remaining closed forests (WRCF), population distribution, and protected areas in global biodiversity hotspots using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Conservation International (CI) has identified 25 eco-regions, called biodiversity hotspots that are especially rich in endemic species and are particularly threatened by human activities. This study uses globally consistent and comprehensive geo-spatial data sets generated using rerriote sensing and other sources, and the application of GIS layering methods. The consistent data set has made it possible to identify and quantify relationships between the WRCF, human population, and protected areas in biodiversity hotspots. It is expected that such information will provide a scientific basis for biodiversity hotspots management and assist in policy formulations at the national and international levels.'

Abstract: 'The impact of diseases such as Phytophthora foot rot and the replacement of unproductive cultivars by high yielding ones has brought about the disappearance of varieties in Piper species, like any other crop. Black pepper (King of spices), is a major spice crop consumed throughout the world. It is widely cultivated across various parts of the world apart from India. The different cultivars may be genetically related and could be a source of valuable genes for disease resistance and an increase in quantity and quality. Even though Western Ghats in India is believed to be the site of origin of this crop, numerous accessions from the NBPGR have not yet been evaluated. Our study aims to investigate the genetic relatedness in major cultivars of black pepper using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism.'

Abstract: "India has 19 370 small reservoirs with a total water surface area of 3 153 366 ha. At least 100 of them have been subjected to scientific studies. Habitat variables responsible for a reservoir's productivity can be summed up into climatic, morphometric and hydro-edaphic factors. The peninsular reservoirs are characterized by a narrow range of fluctuations in water and air temperature across seasons, a phenomenon which prevents the formation of thermal stratification. Many reservoirs in the upper peninsula show thermal stratification during summer. Wind-induced turbulence facilitates the return of nutrients to the trophogenic zone. Most reservoirs on the mountain slopes of Western Ghats, Himalayas and the other highlands are deeper, with steeper basin walls, compared to irrigation impoundments. Mean depth does not show any direct correlation with productivity, either at primary or fish level. A high shoreline development index gives a better indication of productivity. Plankton, benthos and periphyton pulses of Indian reservoirs coincide with the months of least level fluctuations. Oligotrophic tendencies shown by some reservoirs are mainly due to poor nutrient status and other chemical deficiencies. In most cases, poor water quality is accountable to poor catchment soil. Low levels of phosphate and nitrate are not indicative of low productivity due to quick recycling of these nutrients. Specific conductivity reflects the production propensities of reservoirs satisfactorily. Almost all productive reservoirs have a klinograde oxygen curve and a vertical stratification of chemical variables such as pH, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity and specific conductivity. High seasonal rainfall and discharge of water during monsoon result in high flushing rates, which do not favour colonization by macrophytic communities. Similarly, inadequate availability of suitable substrata retards the growth of periphyton. Plankton constitutes the major link in the trophic structure. A rich plankton community with well-marked succession is the hallmark of Indian reservoirs with blue-green algae as the major component. The main factors that retard the growth of benthos are a rocky bottom, frequent water level fluctuation and rapid deposition of silt and other suspended particles. Large reservoirs, on average, harbour 60 species of fishes, of which at least 40 contribute to the commercial fisheries. Fast-growing Indian major carps are the prominent commercial fishes. Dam construction has adversely affected populations of many other species such as Tenualosa ilisha, Torspp. and Cirrhinus spp. Formulae for estimating fish yield potential and stocking density are described. While culture-based fisheries have been successfully practiced in many small reservoirs, the management norm followed in medium and large reservoirs is primarily on capture fishery. In large and medium reservoirs, stocking was successful only when stocked fishes bred. Indian experience on species enhancement and introductions is described. Environmental enhancement of small reservoirs has been attempted in some reservoirs of Tamil Nadu. Modeling, using standard population parameters, such as the density-dependent growth, size dependent mortalityand weight\xe2\x80\x93length relationshipis discussed. Two exotic fishes viz., Oreochromis mossambicus and Cyprinus carpio have been introduced into Indian reservoir with discouraging results. Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, after an accidental introduction, has performed well in Gobindsagar, a reservoir with a distinct cold water regime. Reservoir fisheries in India are well poised for development, provided scientific management norms are adopted."

Abstract: 'A survey of 35 tree species (belonging to 28 genera in 19 families) in Aliyar, South India was carried out to ascertain their arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal status. All the tree species examined had AM association. AM and DSE colonization is reported for the first time in 20 and 14 species respectively. Cooccurrence of AM and DSE was observed in 14 (40%) tree species. The extent of DSE colonization was inversely related to the extent of AM fungal colonization. Six tree species had Arum-type, 18 had intermediatetype and 11 had typical Paris-type AM morphology. AM fungal spore morphotypes belonging to 11 species in two genera were isolated from the rhizosphere soil. AM fungal spore numbers were not related to the extent of AM colonization and Glomus dominated spore diversity. AM association individually and along with DSE were found respectively in the 63% and 44% of the economically important tree species. The occurrence of AM and DSE fungal association in economically important indigenous tree species indicates the possibility of exploiting this association in future conservation programmes of these species.'

Abstract: 'Wildlife reserves are becoming increasingly isolated from the surrounding human-dominated landscapes particularly in Asia. It is imperative to understand how species are distributed spatially and temporally in and outside reserves, and what factors influence their occurrence. This study surveyed 7500\xc2\xa0km2 landscape surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats to examine patterns of occurrence of five herbivores: elephant, gaur, sambar, chital, and pig. Species distributions are modeled spatio-temporally using an occupancy approach. Trained field teams conducted 3860 interview-based occupancy surveys in a 10-km buffer surrounding these five reserves in 2012. I found gaur and wild pig to be the least and most wide-ranging species, respectively. Elephant and chital exhibit seasonal differences in spatial distribution unlike the other three species. As predicted, distance to reserve, the reserve itself, and forest cover were associated with higher occupancy of all species, and higher densities of people negatively influenced occurrence of all species. Park management, species protection, and conflict mitigation efforts in this landscape need to incorporate temporal and spatial understanding of species distributions. All species are known crop raiders and conflict prone locations with resources (such as water and forage) have to be monitored and managed carefully. Wildlife reserves and adjacent areas are critical for long-term persistence and habitat use for all five herbivores and must be monitored to ensure wildlife can move freely. Such a large-scale approach to map and monitor species distributions can be adapted to other landscapes to identify and monitor critical habitats shared by people and wildlife.'

Abstract: 'The diversity of Indian lichen flora has undergone a considerable decline in the last five decades. Among the various anthropogenic activities, overexploitation and selective removal of economically important lichens have become major threats to the lichen flora of the country. Commercial samples of lichens collected from different states of India were studied for their source and commercial use. Among samples offered for sale, 38 different lichen species were identified. The western Himalayas proved to be the main area for lichen collection, while some lichen species also come from the central and Western Ghats. Local traders coordinate the lichen collection and then sell the material to traders in the foothills, and from there it is processed and distributed to other parts of the country and abroad. Because lichens belonging to the families Parmeliaceae and Physciaceae are the ones most exploited commercially, they are recommended for inclusion in the CITES list.'

Abstract: 'The present study were made to estimate the avian fauna in terms of species richness and diversity and guild structure in forest habitats of Nainital district of Uttarakhand (350\xe2\x80\x932.450 m asl; 29\xc2\xb0 N). Field studies were conducted during January 2007 to December 2008. Total 43, 62 and 42 species were recorded from, Haldwani, Bhowali and Nainital forest habitats. Results indicate the species relationship between Bird species richness (BSR) and elevation sections (forest habitats) was not decline simultaneously along elevation; it shows hump shaped. BSR varied considerably along elevational gradient (43 to 62 species), was highest (62 species) at mid elevation (Mixed pine forest, 1.350\xe2\x80\x931.700 m asl) and decreased (20 species) at high elevation (Conifer forest, 1900\xe2\x80\x932450 m asl). It seems that mid altitude bulge is not caused by the presence of a group of mid altitude specialists but rather that there is an overlap in the distribution of low land and high elevation specialists at this altitude. A checklist of 79 avian species has also produced of Nainital district forest habitats. It is suggested that this study provide a base line structure for further study on species distribution in different forest habitats and along different elevation section in Western Himalayas (India).'

Abstract: 'The diversity of plants in tropical forests makes dietary studies of frugivores difficult. This paper provides a botanical inventory of a tropical seasonal forest community in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. The forest is valuable from a conservation perspective because it is one of the last remaining intact forests in northeastern Thailand, and is an important refuge for many animal and plant species. A 4-ha inventory plot measuring 200 \xc3\x97 200\xc2\xa0m was established and all plants greater than or equal to 10\xc2\xa0cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured and permanently labeled. We found 1610 stems belonging to 105 species, 76 genera and 35 families, with a combined basal area of 142.5\xc2\xa0m2. The community was dominated by species of Lauraceae, Cornaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae. About one-third of the plant species (40 spp.) identified in this study were vulnerable to extinction because they were mostly dispersed by large frugivores, which were intolerant of human impact. If they disappear, these forests may become dominated by plant species that are dispersed by abiotic means and species with small-seeded fruits.'

Abstract: ' Hypericum hookerianum (Hypericaceae), a critically endangered plant of Western Ghats, India, has acquired significant importance due to its medicinal implications and ornamental flowers. This species is under severe anthropogenic pressure due to urbanization, tourism, and plantation activities taking place in their natural habitat. A clonal propagation strategy is standardized in this species which offers an opportunity for a stable production of active metabolites from this species as well as their conservation. The study deals with the optimization of axillary bud proliferation using nodal explants followed by genetic stability analysis of regenerants. Maximum number of shoots (3.66) was observed on the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with Kinetin (2.325\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) with 85\xc2\xa0% shoot multiplication frequency. In vitro grown shoots were rooted best in 1/2 MS medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (2.45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) with an average of 6.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.79\xc2\xa0roots/shoot and 95.5\xc2\xa0% rooting frequency. Plantlets were acclimatized best (90\xc2\xa0%) in a mixture of sterile sand and farmyard manure (3:1). Micropropagated plants were subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and phytochemical analysis to confirm their clonal stability. In RAPD analysis, 1032 amplicons were collectively generated which were monomorphic and similar to the mother plant. The comparable major phytochemical constituents in regenerants and mother plants together with genetic uniformity data obtained from RAPD analysis confirmed clonal fidelity of the regenerants. Findings in this study are the first report on micropropagation and assessment of genetic stability of micropropagated plantlets in H. hookerianum which suggests that in vitro axillary shoot proliferation can effectively be used as a tool for propagation and conservation of H. hookerianum.'

Abstract: 'The complete mitochondrial genome of the endemic frog Indirana semipalmata was sequenced. The mitogenome is a circular molecule of 17,052\xc2\xa0bp in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA (r RNA) genes, 21 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and a non-coding D-loop region (control region). Its gene arrangements are similar to the typical neobatrachian-type except for the loss of tRNA  Asn  gene. Our data, which represent the first mitogenome for the genus, will serve as a reference for further studies on the conservation genetics of the endemic amphibian fauna of the Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'To characterize the genetic diversity of present populations of Symplocos laurina, which grow in the montane forests in India, we analyzed the DNA sequences of a nuclear gene. Using the 881\xc2\xa0bp sequence of cytosolic Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, we detected 24 haplotypes among 195 individuals sampled from 14 populations. Two dominant haplotypes were distributed over the entire range of this species in India and several private haplotypes were found. Low genetic diversity within population, high differentiation, number of population specific haplotypes and deviation from neutral evolution characterized the present populations of S. laurina. An analysis of molecular variance indicated the presence of geographic structure within the haplotype distribution. The occurrence of S. laurina preglaciation in India is the most parsimonious explanation for the current geographic structure observed. The populations are presumably ancient and might have spread across its extant distribution range in India through a recent range expansion event.'

Abstract: 'Effective conservation and management of natural resources requires up-to-date information of the land cover (LC) types and their dynamics. Multi-resolution remote sensing (RS) data coupled with additional ancillary topographical layers (both remotely acquired or derived from ground measurements) with appropriate classification strategies would be more effective in capturing LC dynamics and changes associated with the natural resources. Ancillary information would make the decision boundaries between the LC classes more widely separable, enabling classification with higher accuracy compared to conventional methods of RS data classification. In this work, we ascertain the possibility of improvement in classification accuracy of RS data with the addition of ancillary and derived geographical layers such as vegetation indices, temperature, digital elevation model, aspect, slope and texture, implemented in three different terrains of varying topography\xe2\x80\x94urbanised landscape (Greater Bangalore), forested landscape (Western Ghats) and rugged terrain (Western Himalaya).\n The study showed that use of additional spatial ancillary and derived information significantly improved the classification accuracy compared to the classification of only original spectral bands. The analysis revealed that in a highly urbanised area with less vegetation cover and contrasting features, inclusion of elevation and texture increased the overall accuracy of IKONOS data classification to 88.72% (3.5% improvement), and inclusion of temperature, NDVI, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect, Panchromatic band along with texture measures, significantly increased the overall accuracy of Landsat ETM+ data classification to 83.15% (7.6% improvement). In a forested landscape with moderate elevation, temperature was useful in improving the overall accuracy by 6.7 to 88.26%, and in a rugged terrain with temperate climate, temperature, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect and Panchromatic band significantly improved the classification accuracy to 89.97% (10.84% improvement) compared to the classification of only original spectral bands, suggesting selection of appropriate ancillary data depending on the terrain.\n'

Abstract: 'Deforestation and fragmentation are important concerns in managing and conserving tropical forests and have global significance. In the Indian context, in the last one century, the forests have undergone significant changes due to several policies undertaken by government as well as increased population pressure. The present study has brought out spatiotemporal changes in forest cover and variation in forest type in the state of Odisha (Orissa), India, during the last 75\xc2\xa0years period. The mapping for the period of 1924\xe2\x80\x931935, 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2010 indicates that the forest cover accounts for 81,785.6\xc2\xa0km2 (52.5\xc2\xa0%), 56,661.1\xc2\xa0km2 (36.4\xc2\xa0%), 51,642.3\xc2\xa0km2 (33.2\xc2\xa0%), 49,773\xc2\xa0km2 (32\xc2\xa0%) and 48,669.4\xc2\xa0km2 (31.3\xc2\xa0%) of the study area, respectively. The study found the net forest cover decline as 40.5\xc2\xa0% of the total forest and mean annual rate of deforestation as 0.69\xc2\xa0%\xe2\x80\x89year\xe2\x88\x921 during 1935 to 2010. There is a decline in annual rate of deforestation during 1995 to 2010 which was estimated as 0.15\xc2\xa0%. Forest type-wise quantitative loss of forest cover reveals large scale deforestation of dry deciduous forests. The landscape analysis shows that the number of forest patches (per 1,000) are 2.463 in 1935, 10.390 in 1975, 11.899 in 1985, 12.193 in 1995 and 15.102 in 2010, which indicates high anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean patch size (km2) of forest decreased from 33.2 in 1935 to 5.5 in 1975 and reached to 3.2 by 2010. The study demonstrated that monitoring of long term forest changes, quantitative loss of forest types and landscape metrics provides critical inputs for management of forest resources.'

Abstract: 'Water quality of a river is a function of surrounding environment and land use due to its connectivity with land, resulting in pollutants finding their way through land. This necessitates a spatially explicit study of river ecology. The paper presents a pioneer study to establish and explore the linkage between land use and water quality of river Ganga in Varanasi district. The land use land cover (LULC) map of 20\xc2\xa0km of river stretch for buffer radii of 1000\xc2\xa0m in Varanasi revealed that riparian vegetation is negligible in the district. The hierarchical cluster analysis of LULC data suggested that there are two major land use categories, viz., urban and agriculture. The land use wise principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that urbanized areas are major contributor of metals, whereas agricultural land contributes organic matter into the river. The Spearman correlation study revealed that with rising urbanization, the pollutant load into the river increased compared to that from agricultural land use. The statistical analysis of the data clearly concluded that water quality of river Ganga at Varanasi was a function of adjacent land use. The study provides an insight anticipating the Indian government to embrace the relationship of land use to river water quality while formulating policies for the upcoming River Regulation Zone.'

Abstract: 'In the foreseeable future there is little likelihood of achieving consensus on the number of Asian primate genera and species, and their subspecific composition. There is a more realistic hope of reaching agreement on the number of recognizable subspecies. The latter objective is more urgent because in order to reliably assess generic and specific numbers, it is essential that effective conservation measures are implemented for as many subspecies as possible. This cannot be comprehensively accomplished until their validity is assessed and they are satisfactorily established and defined. The Asian primate classification that we present is the outcome of electronic communication among the co-authors after a workshop, which was especially convened to attempt to determine the number of recognizable primate subspecies and to identify potentially recognizable subspecies. The generic and specific arrangement is a compromise that does not necessarily reflect the individual views of the co-authors: 183 subspecies in 77 species in 16 genera. The 31 subspecies allotted a low credibility rating are almost balanced by the 22 scientifically unnamed populations that may warrant subspecific status.'

Abstract: 'Tropical agro-forest landscapes are potentially valuable reserves of forest genetic resources for forestry and restoration of degraded forests. The Dipterocarpaceae is a dominant Southeast Asian family of tree species of global significance for the tropical timber industry. Very little information exists about how effective human modified landscapes are for conserving genetic diversity in dipterocarp species. This study provides a baseline for understanding how fragmented agro-forest landscapes in India sustain forest genetic resources in an endemic dipterocarp tree. We compare genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in the threatened tree species Vateria indica within an isolated and a continuous forest site in the Western Ghats, South India. We place these results in the context of dipterocarps from both the Seychelles and Borneo. Parentage analysis of 694 progeny using twelve nuclear microsatellite markers is applied to estimate pollen and seed dispersal. Using a nursery trial we evaluate effects of inbreeding on growth performance. Our results show that levels of FSGS, and gene dispersal are comparable between a small isolated and a large continuous site of V. indica. Realized long-distance pollen flow into the isolated patch appears to help maintaining genetic diversity. The nursery experiment suggests that selection favours outbred progeny. Individuals of V. indica in close proximity appear less related to each other than in another highly fragmented and endangered dipterocarp species from the Seychelles, but more related than in three dipterocarp species studied in continuous forest in Borneo. We discuss the wider implications of our findings in the context of conservation and restoration of dipterocarp forest genetic resources in fragmented populations.'

Abstract: 'Wildlife conservation is a complex issue especially when it involves large carnivores or mega-herbivores that are conflict-prone. Karnataka state in southern India is known to harbor high density of wild elephants. This conservation success story also has opportunity costs for communities living in close proximity to elephants. Despite the fact that human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict is a serious conservation and social issue, there is little quantitative understanding of conflict especially over large areas. Here we conduct the first analysis of human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict distribution, severity and explanatory factors over the entire state of Karnataka. We use data from the state forest department records on villages that experience conflict, compensation payments made by the government, elephant densities, forest cover and perimeter, and presence of physical barriers to mitigate elephant conflict. In total, 60,939 incidences of crop loss were reported and US$ 2.99\xc2\xa0m paid in compensation during April 2008\xe2\x80\x93March 2011. A total of 91 people were killed by elephants and 101 elephants died in retaliatory killings during the study period. A total of 9.4\xc2\xa0% of the state\xe2\x80\x99s geographic area covering 25 of the 42 forest administrative divisions were affected. There was no significant difference in conflict incidences or compensation given between protected areas and non-protected areas. There was no correlation between conflict incidences/unit area and elephant density, forest cover, forest perimeter of protected areas and presence of physical barriers. The results depict the importance of efficient management of physical barriers, conserving key habitat linkages, and acts as baseline data for future work.'

Abstract: 'Genetic variation, haplotype relationships, and potential regions of diversity in Symplocos laurina Wall. (Symplocaceae), a montane tree species from India, have been tested using molecular and biogeographical data to infer phylogeographic patterns. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was used to determine the chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA haplotypes of 218 individuals from 12 populations, collected from Northeast India (NEI), which is a part of Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, and South India, which includes the Western Ghats (WG), another biodiversity hotspot from India and Eastern Ghats (EG). Nine cpDNA (chlorotypes) and 24 mtDNA haplotypes (mitotypes) were identified; the WG region was identified as the most diverse for chlorotypes and the NEI region for mitotypes. Although a strong population differentiation was observed, phylogeographic structure was found to be absent for both the genomes. The haplotype network revealed the presence of two main lineages: NEI-WG lineage and EG lineage, largely without overlapping distributions. The study tests two hypotheses, namely vicariance and dispersal, to understand the distribution of plants in India. The population structure of S. laurina strongly suggests the persistence of the species in putative refugial areas preglaciation and further establishment of other populations of S. laurina from these refugial populations.'

Abstract: 'Anthropogenic disturbances influence plant regeneration and species diversity, which impact the conservation status of protected areas. A study was conducted in the Sitakund Botanical Garden and Eco-park (SBGE), Chittagong, Bangladesh to analyze the natural regeneration and tree species diversity in disturbed and less disturbed zones. Stratified and systematic random sampling was used to select 50 sample plots from each of the two zones. A total number of 109 plant species from 43 families were recorded in the study; of which 93 species were of natural origin while the rest were planted. From the species with natural origin 66 were tree species, 9 were shrub species and 18 were climbers. Species richness, density of regeneration and disturbance index in the height classes (0\xe2\x80\x930.5 m) and (dbh > 6 cm) indicated significant differences between the zones. The study analyzed how disturbances affect species diversity in the area. It was found that species richness and basal area are negatively related with disturbances. Moreover, density (N/ha) of trees was more likely to decrease with increasing tree height that reflects the huge demand of local people to harvest large trees as part of their income generating activities. The study findings have implications for future management decisions of the SGBE. To restore these ecosystems, management should focus on both biodiversity conservation and providing benefits to local people without hampering forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Statistical downscaling (SD) establishes empirical relationships between coarse-resolution climate model simulations with higher-resolution climate variables of interest to stakeholders. These statistical relations are estimated based on historical observations at the finer resolutions and used for future projections. The implicit assumption is that the SD relations, extracted from data are stationary or remain unaltered, despite non-stationary change in climate. The validity of this assumption relates directly to the credibility of SD. Falsifiability of climate projections is a challenging proposition. Calibration and verification, while necessary for SD, are unlikely to be able to reproduce the full range of behavior that could manifest at decadal to century scale lead times. We propose a design-of-experiments (DOE) strategy to assess SD performance under nonstationary climate and evaluate the strategy via a transfer-function based SD approach. The strategy relies on selection of calibration and validation periods such that they represent contrasting climatic conditions like hot-versus-cold and ENSO-versus-non-ENSO years. The underlying assumption is that conditions such as warming or predominance of El Ni\xc3\xb1o may be more prevalent under climate change. In addition, two different historical time periods are identified, which resemble pre-industrial and the most severe future emissions scenarios. The ability of the empirical relations to generalize under these proxy conditions is considered an indicator of their performance under future nonstationarity. Case studies over two climatologically disjoint study regions, specifically India and Northeast United States, reveal robustness of DOE in identifying the locations where nonstationarity prevails as well as the role of effective predictor selection under nonstationarity.'

Abstract: 'A morphometric evaluation of Tamiraparani subbasin was carried out to determine the drainage characteristics using GIS model technique. Extraction of the subbasin and stream network model has been developed to quantify the drainage parameters in the study area. The input parameters required to run this model are: a pour point, a minimum upstream area in hectares, and a digital elevation model. After execution, the model provides a drainage basin with Strahler\xe2\x80\x99s classified stream network supported by thematic layers like aspect, slope, relief, and drainage density. The developed model reveals that the drainage area of this subbasin is 2,055\xc2\xa0km2 and shows subdendritic to dendritic drainage pattern. The basin includes seventh order stream and mostly dominated by lower stream order. The slope of the study area varies from 0\xc2\xb0 in the east to 61\xc2\xb0 towards west. The presence of Western Ghats is the chief controlling factor for slope variation. Moreover, the slope variation is controlled by the local lithology and erosion cycles. The bifurcation ratio indicates that the geological structures have little influence on the drainage networks and the drainage density reveals that the nature of subsurface strata is permeable.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity hotspots are used widely to designate priority regions for conservation efforts. It is unknown, however, whether the current network of hotspots adequately represents globally threatened taxonomic diversity for whole plant and animal groups. We used a mammalian group traditionally neglected in terms of conservation efforts, the rodents, in order to test whether biodiversity hotspots match the current distribution of threatened taxa (genera and species). Significantly higher numbers of threatened rodent genera and species fell within biodiversity hotspots; nonetheless over 25% of the total threatened genera and species did not occur in any biodiversity hotspot. This was particularly true for the Australian region, where 100% of the threatened genera and species fell outside biodiversity hotspots, with many threatened taxa found in Papua-New Guinea. We suggest to officially including Papua New Guinea among biodiversity hotspots for rodents, and also the steppic/semidesert areas of central Asia.'

Abstract: 'The history of ecology and evolutionary biology is rife with attempts to define and delimit species. However, there has been confusion between concepts and criteria, which has led to discussion, debate, and conflict, eventually leading to lack of consistency in delimitation. Here, we provide a broad review of species concepts, a clarification of category versus concept, an account of the general lineage concept (GLC), and finally a way forward for species discovery and delimitation. Historically, species were considered as varieties bound together by reproduction. After over 200 years of uncertainty, Mayr attempted to bring coherence to the definition of species through the biological species concept (BSC). This has, however, received much criticism, and the last half century has spawned at least 20 other concepts. A central philosophical problem is that concepts treat species as \xe2\x80\x98individuals\xe2\x80\x99 while the criteria for categorization treats them as \xe2\x80\x98classes\xe2\x80\x99. While not getting away from this problem entirely, the GLC attempts to provide a framework where lineage divergence is influenced by a number of different factors (and correlated to different traits) which relate to the different species concepts. We also introduce an \xe2\x80\x98inclusive\xe2\x80\x99 probabilistic approach for understanding and delimiting species. Finally, we provide a Wallacean (geography related) approach to the Linnaean problem of identifying and delimiting species, particularly for cases of allopatric divergence, and map this to the GLC. Going one step further, we take a morphometric terrain approach to visualizing and understanding differences between lineages. In summary, we argue that while generalized frameworks may work well for concepts of what species are, plurality and \xe2\x80\x98inclusive\xe2\x80\x99 probabilistic approaches may work best for delimitation.'

Abstract: 'This article focuses on the relationship between priority-setting in conservation and in taxonomy. A simple and generally applicable scheme is presented based on prior quantitative extinction threat evaluation. In the main part of the study we describe the assessment of the herbarium voucher collection date time series of 21 endemic fig tree species of Ficus sect. Oreosycea (Moraceae). The fig tree assessment is then compared with the available IUCN Red List data and with the collection information on two other groups of endemic tree radiations in New Caledonia: ebonies of Diospyros sect. Maba (Ebenaceae) and the Iguanura palm lineage (Arecaceae). We find a remarkably low level of extinction threat evident in Ficus but a pronounced need to differentiate between true species rarity and putative rarity of potential taxonomic artifacts. To this end it is proposed how such numerical evaluations can be used to set future priorities for the assessment or validation of the taxonomic and conservation status of taxa. The limitations and implications of the evaluation are discussed and relevant criteria for a meaningful analysis of collection records are listed. Finally, putting our results on woody plants into perspective, we briefly review the general conservation situation and outlook of New Caledonia, acknowledging both its high conservation priority and potential.'

Abstract: 'Pachmarhi biosphere reserve (PBR) encompasses 3 biodiversity conservation units viz. Pachmarhi Sanctuary, Satpura National Park and Bori Sanctuary, extending to an area of 4987.38\xc2\xa0square km. PBR has been recognized as one of the 26 endemic centers of the country and therefore the diversity of flora at the region holds much significance. The bryophyte diversity of PBR has been a matter of consideration by workers over several decades. The present work describes 13 epiphytes belonging to 9 families and 11 genera among which 5 taxa viz. Platygyriella aurea (Schwaegr.) Buck, Leucoloma amoene\xe2\x80\x94virens Mitt., Meiothecium microcarpum (Hook.) Mitt., Leucobryum juniperoideum (Brid.) C. Muell. and Entodontopsis setschwanica (Broth.) Buck & Ireland are new to PBR. Stereophyllaceae, Hypnaceae and Dicranaceae emerged as relatively frequent families and Entodontopsis nitens and Entodontopsis leucostega as the dominant taxa. Epiphytic flora of a region accounts for ecological and environmental importance therefore, unveiling of epiphytic moss flora of PBR will undoubtedly aid in further studies on biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'We examined the impact of picnic activities on forest diversity, structure, regeneration and vitality of tree species in the Bhawal National Park of Bangladesh. The study area was classified as a non-used, occasionally used and frequently used area on the basis of the intensity of the picnic activities. A total of 43 plant species were enumerated in the whole study area. The highest plant species richness (41 species) was observed in the non-used area whereas the lowest species richness (11 species) in the frequently used area. The diversity index decreased with the increase of picnic intensity whereas the concentration of dominance increased. Density of all plant groups except mature trees, and the basal area of the mature trees showed a declining trend from the non-used to frequently used area. The frequently used area exhibited very poor regeneration. Tree vitality decreased with the increase of picnic intensity. The relevance of our study as a basis for further research to determine the impact of tourism on biodiversity in Bangladesh is discussed.'

Abstract: 'The use of paddock trees as stepping stones by birds was assessedin a grazing landscape in southern New South Wales, Australia. A totalof 70 paddock tree sites was surveyed for 20 min each inthe morning, and 36 sites were surveyed again in the afternoon in March2000. During the surveys, the presence, direction of arrival, anddirection of departure to and from sites was recorded for each bird. Astepping stone effect of paddock trees was examined in two ways: (1) byanalysing the arrival and departure direction of birds relative tosurrounding vegetation cover, and (2) by analysing the departuredirection of birds relative to their arrival direction. An arrivaldirection was obtained for 150 independently acting groups of birds, anda departure direction was obtained for 203 independently acting groupsof birds. Both arrival and departure direction were obtained for 87independently acting groups. Foliage-foraging birds tended to followrelatively densely vegetated areas. There was some indication thatgranivores and nectarivores also preferred to move along denselyvegetated areas. This trend was absent for open-country species. Allgroups of birds examined tended to return to their place of origin ormove in the opposite direction of their arrival. This trend was mostpronounced for nectarivores and the foliage-foraging White-plumedHoneyeater (Lichenostomus penicillatus), and lesspronounced for open-country species and parrots. The results arediscussed in relation to the biology and ecology of the various speciesof birds. We conclude that paddock trees have the potential to enhancelandscape connectivity by acting as stepping stones to assist movement.This further highlights their conservation value as demonstrated in thefirst paper of this series.'

Abstract: "Mount Kawa Karpo of the Menri ('Medicine Mountains' in Tibetan), in the eastern Himalayas, is one of the most sacred mountains to Tibetan Buddhists. Numerous sacred sites are found between 1900 and 4000\xc2\xa0m, and at higher elevations the area as a whole is considered a sacred landscape. Religious beliefs may affect the ecology of these sacred areas, resulting in unique ecological characteristics of importance to conservation; recent studies have demonstrated that sacred areas can often play a major role in conservation. The goal of this study is to preliminarily analyze the vegetation of sacred areas in the Menri region using existing vegetation maps and a Geographical Information System (GIS) for remote assessment. Sacred sites are compared to random points in the landscape, in terms of: elevation, vegetation, and nearness to villages; species composition, diversity, and richness; and frequency of useful and endemic plant species. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination reveals that sacred sites differ significantly in both useful species composition (p=0.034) and endemic species composition (p=0.045). Sacred sites are located at lower elevations, and closer to villages, than randomly selected, non-sacred sites (p<\xc2\xa00.0001), and have higher overall species richness (p=0.033) and diversity (p=0.042). In addition, the high-elevation (>\xc2\xa04000\xc2\xa0m) areas of the mountain - a sacred landscape - are found to have significantly more endemics than low-elevation areas (p<0.0001). These findings represent an initial analysis of sacred sites and suggest that sacred sites in the Menri region may be ecologically and ethnobotanically unique."

Abstract: 'The study was carried out with an aim to assess the heavy metal (HM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the air of a biodiversity as well as tourist-rich area of Western Ghats by applying a most frequent growing lichen Remototrachyna awasthii (Hale and Patw.) Divakar and A. Crespo, as biomonitor. Thalli of R. awasthii were collected from eight sites of Mahabaleshwar area located in Western Ghats. Samples were prepared for HM and PAHs quantification by ICP-MS and HPLC, respectively. Total metal concentration (HM) ranged from 644 to 2,277.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 while PAHs concentration between 0.193 and 54.78\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921. HM and PAHs concentrations were the highest at Bus\xc2\xa0Stand while control site (Lingmala Fall) exhibited the lowest concentration of HM as well as PAHs followed by samples from Wilson point (both these sites are having trekking route). It was also evident from this study that vehicular emission played a significant role in the release of HM and PAHs as pollutants in the environment. The effectiveness of R. awasthii as biomonitor could be further investigated by comparing this species with other biomonitors.'

Abstract: 'Soil moisture affects various hydrological processes, including evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff. Forested areas in the lower western Himalaya in India constitute the headwater catchments for many hill streams and have experienced degradation in forest cover due to grazing, deforestation and other human activities. This change in forest cover is likely to alter the soil moisture regime and, consequently, flow regimes in streams. The effect of change in forest cover on soil moisture regimes of this dry region has not been studied through long term field observations. We monitored soil matric potentials in two small watersheds in the lower western Himalaya of India. The watersheds consisted of homogeneous land covers of moderately dense oak forest and moderately degraded mixed oak forest. Observations were recorded at three sites at three depths in each watershed at fortnightly intervals for a period of three years. The soil moisture contents derived from soil potential measurements were analyzed to understand the spatial, temporal and profile variations under the two structures of forest cover. The analysis revealed large variations in soil moisture storage at different sites and depths and also during different seasons in each watershed. Mean soil moisture storage during monsoon, winter and summer seasons was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. Highest soil moisture content occurred at shallow soil profiles, decreasing with depth in both watersheds. A high positive correlation was found between tree density and soil moisture content. Mean soil moisture content over the entire study period was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. This indicated a potential for soil water storage under well managed oak forest. Because soil water storage is vital for sustenance of low flows, attention is needed on the management of oak forests in the Himalayan region.'

Abstract: 'In the context of over-consumption of natural resources in the name of development and rapid industrialization by a small section of the human population that is rapidly growing, the world is currently faced with a variety of environmental uncertainties. \xe2\x80\x98Global change\xe2\x80\x99 covering a whole variety of ecological issues, and \xe2\x80\x98globalization\xe2\x80\x99 in an economic sense, are two major phenomena that are responsible for these uncertainties. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the developing countries more than the developed, particularly the marginalized traditional (those living close to nature and natural resources) societies would be the worst sufferers. In order to cope with this problem in a situation where the traditional societies have to cope with rapidly depleting biodiversity on which they are dependant for their livelihood, there is an urgent need to explore additional pathways for sustainable management of natural resources and societal development. Such pathways should be based on a landscape management strategy, that takes into consideration the rich traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) that these societies have. This is critical because TEK is the connecting link between conservation and sustainable development. This paper explores the possibilities in this direction through a balanced approach to development, that links the \xe2\x80\x98traditional\xe2\x80\x99 with the \xe2\x80\x98modern\xe2\x80\x99, in a location-specific way.'

Abstract: 'Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the pilgrimage and tourist town of Pushkar, India, this article looks at the environmental degradation that has befallen the holy lake there and explores efforts on the part of locals to clean it. While local Hindus believe unequivocally that their town is a heavenly place, many nevertheless recognize the need to actualize that belief. The article contends that the broad goal of making Pushkar paradise, and more specifically, the task of cleaning the lake, involves a robust process of ritualization. Thinking alongside the work of Catherine Bell, the article aims to show how environmentalism becomes ritualized, and in turn renders a place sacred. The article concludes with the idea that cleaning the lake is both an activity born out of the understanding that Pushkar is paradise and one that simultaneously sets paradise in the making.'

Abstract: 'The studies on forest cover change can reveal the status of forests and facilitate for its conservation planning. Idukki is the largest district in the state of Kerala having a total geographical area of 5019\xc2\xa0km2. The objectives of the present study are to map forest cover in Idukki district using multi-temporal remote sensing data (1975, 1990, 2001 and 2012) and topographical maps (1925), to analyze the trends in deforestation and land use changes. Overall statistics for the period of 1925 indicate that about 4675.7\xc2\xa0km2 (93.2\xc2\xa0%) of the landscape was under forest. The forest cover in 2012 was estimated as 2613.4\xc2\xa0km2 (52.1\xc2\xa0%). Recently, due to the implementation of policies and protection efforts, the rate of deforestation was greatly reduced.

Abstract: 'In order to examine the spatial distribution of forest resources on local territories and to understand the factors controlling such distributions, we studied the spatial patterns of a group of 23 useful plant species on the territory of a Kuna community in the province of Darien, Panama. A stratified random sampling scheme was used to survey the distribution and abundance of the species across a 3500 ha area around the village. Data on the physical environment as well as the geographic coordinates of the sample plots were also obtained. A series of canonical analyses was conducted to evaluate the species\xe2\x80\x93environment relationships and to identify spatial structures in the species distributions left unexplained by the environmental variables. Four distinct distribution patterns were identified among the species; these were most strongly explained by land-use, the degree of canopy closure and topography. Significant spatial structures, independent of the measured environmental variables, were related to anthropogenic pressure and an edaphic gradient, and the habitat associations of the individual species were described. The results obtained from this case study suggest that land-use dynamics may play a predominant role in structuring inhabited landscapes, and that diversity in distribution patterns and habitat associations will require a combination of spatially explicit management strategies to ensure the local resource base.'

Abstract: 'In a number of places, sacred forest sites play an important role in conservation and local livelihoods. Here we examine how Iban hunters and animals alike use sacred forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. To determine the relative importance of different sites in hunting, we compare hunting effort, animal species and their numbers encountered by hunters, and encounters and captures in a variety of forest sites including sacred groves. We relate the results to the role of such sites in the overall Iban agroforestry system and in the conservation of forest habitat that professional conservationists deem precious. Such land use practices, while having social and religious origins, may be important for local economic purposes, but they may also be valuable in promoting and enhancing the more global goals of biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'Khawa Karpo, in the eastern Himalayas, is a mountain considered sacred throughout Tibet, and is internationally recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot. Numerous areas within this landscape are considered \xe2\x80\x98sacred\xe2\x80\x99 by the indigenous Tibetans of the region, who interact with these sites in ways potentially beneficial to conservation. Our previous remote sensing study indicated that sacred sites are found in habitats with greater species richness, diversity, and endemism than randomly selected non-sacred sites. This study examines the role of sanctity in biodiversity conservation within habitats in the Khawa Karpo region by pairing plots within the same habitats in sacred and non-sacred areas. Understory richness, diversity, cover, and number of useful species are measured; for trees, richness, diversity, cover, and density are measured. Results indicate that within habitats sanctity does not affect understory plant communities; however, within sacred areas trees are larger (p = 0.003) and forests have greater cover (p = 0.003) than non-sacred areas. Our results indicate that, whereas placement of sacred areas and preservation of vegetation cover affects useful plants, biodiversity and endemism, within habitats sacred sites preserve old growth trees and forest structure. In sum, Tibetan sacred sites are ecologically unique and important for conservation on varying scales of landscape, community, and species.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation is a primary driver of biotic extinctions in the tropics. The impacts of deforestation in tropical biodiversity hotspots are of particular concern because these regions contain high concentrations of globally endemic species. However, the effects of large-scale deforestation on native biotas within the biodiversity hotspot of Himalaya remain poorly documented. Here we report on an alarming trend of deforestation in the Indian Himalaya and project the likely consequential extinctions of endemic taxa (species and subspecies) by 2100 across a broad range of taxonomic groups, including gymnosperms, angiosperms, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. With the current level of deforestation, by 2100 only about 10% of the land area of the Indian Himalaya will be covered by dense forest (>40% canopy cover)\xe2\x80\x94a scenario in which almost a quarter of the endemic species could be wiped out, including 366 endemic vascular plant taxa and 35 endemic vertebrate taxa. We also show that inaccurate reporting of forest cover data by governmental institutions can result in underestimations of the biological impacts of deforestation, as well as potential miscalculations in land-use decisions (e.g., the construction of hydroelectric dams). Large-scale conservation efforts, including forest protection and reforestation, are urgently needed to avoid the impending deforestation-driven biodiversity losses in the Himalaya.'

Abstract: 'Literature on spot-billed pelican has not been reviewed lately which could provide a critique of the emerging data. We have now chosen it as a key species through which we suggest a conservation action plan which will benefit several waterbird species. The information provided here is scholastic in nature and is meant to focus on aspects that require attention and help plan future work for applied conservation. All known information on this species is brought together in this review which will also provide an update of its biology. Notes on the breeding biology of the species first published in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. So far, 380 works have appeared on the species; of these, 36 contain material reported in earlier works or appeared as papers subsequently. Most appeared as articles in journals, both national and regional, a few international journals, newsletters/bulletins (48.2%), 4 dissertations, 76 reports and 6 popular science articles in magazines. This review on the species will provide an insight into different factors that can be weighed and combined while making a decision in investing resources in species conservation, i.e. importance of the species, level of threat and the time frame over which results are to be achieved.'

Abstract: ' Mikania micrantha, a creeper and climber, has invaded forests and agricultural areas in the Western Ghats. A quantification of the effect of Mikania on species richness and factors that contribute to its success would help to understand the invasion success of Mikania in the Western Ghats of India. This study investigated its impact on species richness and factors that contribute to its invasion success. Impact of Mikania on species richness was studied in areas invaded by Mikania and not yet invaded by Mikania by quadrat (1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x891\xc2\xa0m2) method. Growth experiments were carried out with Mikania rhizosphere soil and soil treated with Mikania leaf leachate. Chemical characteristics such as electrical conductivity, organic matter, extractable P, total organic N and water-soluble phenolics, and microbial respiration of soil invaded by Mikania and not yet invaded by Mikania were measured. We observed lower species richness in areas invaded by Mikania compared to areas not yet invaded by Mikania. Seedling growth was suppressed in Mikania rhizosphere soil or soil treated with higher levels of Mikania leaf leachate. Higher levels of organic matter, total organic N and water-soluble phenolics, and lower microbial activity were observed in Mikania rhizosphere soil. Soil treated with Mikania leaf leachate has higher amounts of water-soluble phenolics. Mikania invasion appears to reduce plant species richness in the Western Ghats, and discourage seedling growth of certain plant species. Factors that are likely to contribute to Mikania success are its ability to pre-empt light and alter soil chemistry and biochemistry in ways that benefit the species.'

Abstract: 'Rapid multiplication of endangered Vanda coerulea Griff ex. Lindl. (Orchidaceae) was achieved through culture of shoot tips of mature plants, shoot tips and leaf bases of 8-month-old axenic seedlings on Mitra et al. (1976) medium supplemented with 10% coconut water, 500 mg1-1 casein hydrolysate and a combination of 8.8 \xce\xbcM benzyladenine and 4.1 \xce\xbcM napthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Shoot tips (0.5 \xe2\x80\x93 0.8 cm) cultured in both agar and agitated liquid media responded alike with direct formation of 3\xe2\x80\x9312 shoot buds in 12 weeks, while callus-free formation of 3\xe2\x80\x938 protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) in 4\xe2\x80\x938 weeks was noticed in seedling leaf base segments (1.0\xe2\x80\x931.5 cm). Formation of new buds or PLBs, rapid growth of buds into shoots and emergence of shoots from PLBs occurred when the explants with proliferating buds / PLBs were subcultured in medium enriched with 35 g 1-1 banana pulp, 30% coconut water and 1.08 \xce\xbcM NAA. A maximum of 70 and 100 shoots of varied length were obtained from a single shoot tip/leaf base explant after 30 weeks of culture. Rooting of shoots (3.0\xe2\x80\x934.0 cm) occurred in medium containing 35 g 1-1 banana pulp and 1.08 \xce\xbcM NAA within 3\xe2\x80\x934 weeks. Rooted plants were established easily (95\xe2\x80\x93100%) in community pots without hardening. The regenerated plants were cytologically stable (2n = 38).

Abstract: 'Tiger, being a solitary and territorial animal, often tends to move out of protected areas into the surrounding forests. This is especially true in the case of sub-adult animals leading to escalating conflicts and deaths in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Unless adequately protected against various human activities, such corridors and surrounding forests will soon disappear, trapping the animals within protected areas with resultant local extinctions. In this paper we ascertain tiger presence, occupancy and numbers in one such partially protected area, the Sathyamangalam forest, located close to better known tiger reserves in India, through non-invasive faecal DNA analysis. Here we highlight the potential of Sathyamangalam as a tiger habitat. Tiger positive faecal samples were considered as evidence to establish occupancy in two different parts of Sathyamangalam, reserve forest and wildlife sanctuary. We collected 103 faecal samples out of which 69 were tiger positive. Species occupancy (psi), was 0.672 (\xc2\xb10.197) with a detection probability of 0.2 (\xc2\xb10.06) in the wildlife sanctuary area; while psi was 0.72 (\xc2\xb10.2) with detection probability of 0.212 (\xc2\xb10.6) in the reserve forest. Further, number of males and females, as determined in our study, was close to the ideal sex ratio in a healthy forest with good prey abundance. This study also highlights the presence of more females in the reserve forest (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010) than the wildlife sanctuary (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa03) possibly indicating lesser disturbance and more prey availability. We recommend that the reserve forest to the north of Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary be declared as a tiger reserve. The wildlife sanctuary could serve as a buffer zone between this reserve and Sathyamangalam town which lies to the south of the forest. Proper protection of Sathyamangalam will go a long way in saving the entire landscape and tigers of the Western Ghats of India.'

Abstract: 'We surveyed the distribution and status of the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis umbrosa) in the Nicobar Islands of India. Long-tailed macaques live on 3 islands: Great Nicobar, Little Nicobar and Katchal. There are a total 788 groups. Group size ranged from 25 to 56 individuals with a mean size of 36. Long-tailed macaques are a multimale-multifemale society. Adult males, adult females and immatures constituted 9.7 per cent, 43.2 per cent and 47.1 per cent of the population, respectively. A fairly high ratio of immatures to adult females indicates a healthy population turnover. Vegetation parameters including tree density, canopy cover, canopy height and basal area indicated a still healthful habitats on all the 3 islands. We observed a few threats to the macaques. Measures should be undertaken to ensure survival of the Nicobar subspecies.'

Abstract: 'Knowledge on the structure and composition of the plant communities has enormous significance in conservation and management of forests. The present study aimed to assess the community attributes, viz., structure, composition and diversity in the moist and dry sal (Shorea robusta) forests in the West Bengal province of India and compare them with the other sal forests of India. The phytosociological data from these forests were quantitatively analysed to work out the species richness, diversity, evenness, dominance, importance value, stand density and the basal area. The analysis showed that plant richness and diversity in moist sal forests of northern West Bengal are higher than the dry sal forests of south-west Bengal; a total of 134 tree (cbh \xe2\x89\xa530\xc2\xa0cm), 113 shrub and 230 herb species were recorded in the moist sal forest compared to 35 tree, 41 shrub and 96 herb species in dry sal forest. Papilionaceae was observed to be the dominant family. Dry sal forests had higher tree dominance (0.81) and stand density (1,006 stems\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) but lower basal area (19.62 m2ha\xe2\x88\x921) while moist sal forest had lower tree dominance (0.18) and stand density (438 stems\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) but higher basal area (56.52\xc2\xa0m2ha\xe2\x88\x921). Tree species richness and stem density across girth classes in both the types decreased from the smallest to largest trees, while the occurrence rate of species increased with increase in girth class. A t-test showed significant differences in species richness, basal area and the stand density at 95% confidence level (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0<0.05) in the two forest types. The CCA indicated very low overall match (canonical correlation value\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.40) between the two sets of variables from moist and dry sal types. The differences in these forests could be attributed to the distinct variations in climatic conditions- mainly the rainfall, disturbance regimes and the management practices.'

Abstract: 'The mortality rate of herpetofauna due to road accidents in one of the busiest tarmacked metalled roads of Durgapur, an industrial town of West Bengal, India was studied. Road survey for 27 days covering a total distance of 94.5 km was conducted. Within this span of time and the total stretch of road, 354 amphibians belonging to 6 species and 133 reptiles belonging to 11 species were observed to be killed in road-accidents. Among amphibians, Duttaphrynus melanostictus and amongst the reptiles Hemidactylus spp. were killed in highest numbers. The stretch of road under survey passed through different habitat patches like\xe2\x80\x99s agricultural land, human habitation, dumping area, fragmented forest and wetland. On an average, 18 herpetofauna was noted to be killed daily. It was difficult to identify the species as the key characters were missing in the remains in a few cases of road casualties. High road mortality of herpetofauna would surely affect the balance of adjoining ecosystems as well as may be crucial for the local herpetofaunal population attributes.'

Abstract: 'Assessment of erosion status of a watershed is an essential prerequisite for integrated watershed management. It not only assists in chalking out suitable soil and water conservation measures to arrest erosion and conserve water but also helps in devising best management practices to enhance biomass production in watersheds. Keeping this in view, the present study has been undertaken by involving geospatial-statistical techniques to determine the critical and priority areas for soil and water conservation in Suketi watershed of the lower Himachal Himalayan region. A novel weighted sum analysis technique was used for ranking each of hydrological unit by obtaining the weightages from various morphometric parameters. This technique offers dynamic, effective and sustainable approach over traditional prioritization methods in which significance of each parameter were considered equally. Considering this approach, sub-watersheds were delineated into low, medium and high priority zones. The results illustrate that about 52 % of sub-watersheds of Suketi watershed are in moderate to high erosion and runoff susceptible zones. Therefore, these potential areas can be considered for preferential soil and water conservation planning. The results obtained from the study will be useful for various stakeholders such as agriculturists, water resource managers, conservation measures planners and decision policy makers for better management practices and decision making. The geospatial-statistical technique can be used for effective estimation of erosion status of watersheds leading to watershed prioritization for taking up soil and water conservation measures in watershed systems. Finally, this technique can be very useful in remote, rugged and inaccessible watersheds with absence of soil erosion and runoff monitoring.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82On 28 June 1994 when 240\xe2\x80\x89mm of rainfall occurred, a huge debris slide took place at Parmachi village in the Varandh Ghat of the Konkan district on the west coast of India. The debris slide resulted in extensive damage to property and killed 20 people in addition to numerous animals. The slide is considered to have occurred due to the development of hydrostatic pressure at the base of colluvial material, such that slope failure took place at the rock/soil interface. In view of the significance of such slides to settlements and highways, it is proposed that a warning system is developed based on a rainfall threshold of 170\xe2\x80\x89mm in a 24-hour period.'

Abstract: 'The dependence of coastal communities on mangrove forests for direct consumptive use due to the scarcity of alternate resources makes them one of the highly disturbed landscapes. This paper examines the spatial characteristics and extent of anthropogenic disturbances affecting the mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area situated along the east coast of India by using remotely sensed data and GIS, supplemented with socioeconomic surveys. The study reveals that resource extractions from these forests were considerable despite the protected status. Around 14% of the total fuel wood consumed annually in each of the household came from the mangrove forests of the Park. The patterns of consumption were spatially heterogeneous, controlled by the availability of alternatives, ease of accessibility, presence of markets, human density, and forest composition. The disturbance surface showed 30% of the major forest classes to be under high to very high levels of disturbance especially at easy access points. Besides, the distribution of economically useful species also determined the degree of disturbance. Resource use surfaces clearly identified the biotic pressure zones with respect to specific mangrove use and could be combined with the disturbance regime map to prioritize areas for mangrove restoration.'

Abstract: 'A comparative study of butterfly communities in 15 urban/suburban remnants of tropical semideciduous forest in Campinas (S\xc3\xa3o Paulo state, SE Brazil; 24\xc2\xb0S, 47\xc2\xb0W), with areas from 1.0 to 252\xe2\x80\x89ha and widely varying histories and environments, shows that the most significant factors, besides area and sampling time, distinguishing the sites and influencing their diversity (80\xe2\x80\x93702 species) and composition are connectivity, permanent water, vegetation, flowers, and human impact (negative, including pollution). The diversified Nymphalidae butterflies (38\xe2\x80\x93213 species) and especially two fermented-bait-attracted groups (Satyrinae, 2\xe2\x80\x9330 species, and Biblidini, 9\xe2\x80\x9344 species), are among the more useful indicators of the quality and diversity of the environments in these fragments. Effective conservation of butterfly communities in tropical cities may be achieved by maintenance of arboreal green corridors along streets and watercourses between moderately large (>10\xe2\x80\x89ha) humid areas, not near to the most built-up or polluted city centre(s), and the inclusion within these areas of ponds or streams, diversified native forest, and open vegetation including abundant nectar-rich flowers.'

Abstract: 'Between-group encounters are an obvious outcome of intergroup competition. Between-group encounters in primates range from avoidance to fatally aggressive. The prevailing hypotheses explain such encounters as mate defense strategy by males and resource defense strategy by females. However, the rate and nature of between-group encounters may also be influenced by habitat and demographic characteristics. We studied the effect of forest fragment size on group encounters in lion-tailed macaques in the Western Ghats of southern India. The encounter rate decreased as the fragment size increased. Group density and home range overlap correlated positively with the encounter rate. The aggressive encounters were more in the relatively medium-sized fragment where the observed frequency of between-group encounters was higher than the expected frequency than in the small fragment and the large forest complex. Together, these results indicate a complex pattern of effects of fragment size on between-group encounters in primates.'

Abstract: 'The paper initially outlines selected uncertainties influencing climate change and their linkages with hydrology which have led to only a small section of the hydrological community (divided into 2 groups) being pro-active. Due to the foregoing uncertainties, the strategy adopted in this paper will be to focus on the principal conclusions from controlled experimental catchment studies and related process hydrology connected with land-use change arising from anthropogenic influences. The underlying philosophy is that even major natural disruptions to climate cause ecohydrological shifts in the response of landscapes and such changes may be indicated from recent hydrology research evaluating man-made impacts. The paper assesses the existing conclusions from hydrological work undertaken in both the closed forests of the humid tropics and the open forests of the tropical semi-arid regions based mostly from experimentation in headwater catchments. Such studies are concerned with the hydrological responses to the impacts of forest conversion on the change in total water yield and, in turn, the processes connected with dry weather flow (delayed flow) and storm runoff (quickflow). By taking the above approach, possible hydrological changes to climate change will be inferred, including some consideration given the outputs from atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs) using the Amazon basin as an example.'

Abstract: ' Vateria indica (Dipterocarpaceae) is an economically and ecologically important canopy tree endemic to the Western Ghats, India. The species has undergone extensive habitat loss and overexploitation and is therefore listed as \xe2\x80\x98critically endangered\xe2\x80\x99 on the 2012 IUCN Red List. We developed ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for V. indica. In addition, we confirm cross amplification and variation in two loci isolated from the closely related but geographically disjunct species Vateriopsis seychellarum, previously published by Finger et al. Conserv Genet Resour, 2 (S1):309\xe2\x80\x93311, (2010). The twelve microsatellite primers screened on 48 adult samples of V. indica had 5\xe2\x80\x9311 alleles per locus (mean of 8.5 per locus) with an average polymorphic information content of 0.64 across loci. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.44 to 0.84. These markers will enable us to quantify population genetic diversity in habitat fragments and to study fine scale spatial genetic structure and contemporary gene flow.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation studies have attracted considerable attention over the past two decades. Analyses of local deforestation examine the significance of numerous explanatory variables for the extraction of forest products. This study distinguishes among the explanatory variables as household-specific and site-specific, and argues for in-depth analysis of household-specific variables. It examines the role of household size, income, and education on firewood extraction and beedi-making in the Western Ghats of India, a hotspot of biodiversity. The study documents the incidence of these livelihoods, investigates the interaction among the three variables, and uses logistic regression models to determine the exact probability for the livelihoods. Two novel features of the study include analysis of wood and non-wood extraction through a single dataset and determination of model by the data. The results show high dependency of households on forest-based livelihoods, situations when the probability of livelihoods changes substantially, and non-parallel trends for household dependency. The study suggests the role of household-specific variables as the agents of motivation and persistence for forest-based livelihoods and presents a hypothesis about the critical size of household in forest dependency. The study recommends four measures\xe2\x80\x94harvest of ecosystem services, rise in income, migration and mobility, and environmental education\xe2\x80\x94to promote sustainable livelihoods.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry system has the enormous capacity to achieve social, economic, and environmental goals by optimizing land productivity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the land potentiality in India for agroforestry based on FAO land suitability criteria utilizing various land, soil, climate, and topographic themes. This was achieved in GIS Domain by integrating various thematic layers scientifically. The analysis of land potentiality in India for agroforestry suitability reveals 32.8% as highly suitable (S1), 40.4% moderately suitable (S2), 11.7% marginally suitable (S3), and 9.1% not suitable (NS). About 52% of land of India is under the cropland category. In addition, it revealed that the 46% of these cropland areas fall into high agroforestry suitable category \xe2\x80\x9cS1,\xe2\x80\x9d and provide huge opportunity for harnessing agroforestry practices. Furthermore, agroforestry suitability mapping in broad ecosystem and in different agroecological regions will assist various projects in India at the regional level. Such results will also boost the various objectives of the National Agroforestry Policy (2014, http://www.cafri.res.in/NAF_Policy.pdf) and policymakers of India where they need to extend it. The potential of geospatial technology can be exploited in the field of agroforestry for the benefit of rural poor people/farmers by ensuring food and ecological security, resilience in livelihoods, and can sustain extreme weather events such as droughts and climate change impact. Such type of research can be replicated in India at village level (local level) to state level (regional level) utilizing the significant themes which affect the agroforestry suitability. This will certainly fetch better results on ground and will significantly assist the management programs.'

Abstract: 'There is enough evidence to show that the forest biomass has decreased significantly in the Indian Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh. The government has responded through restrictive measures to check this decline. Using tree biomass as proxy for degradation, we assessed the current state of biomass within dominant land use types and examined its implications for sustainability. The highest above-ground mean tree biomass density of 1158 t\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 was recorded for the reserved forest followed by 728, 13, 11, 8, 5 and 3 t\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 in the protected forest, fallow land, cultivated-unirrigated land, grassland, orchard land and cultivated-irrigated land respectively. Of the total accessible biomass, only 0.31% was extracted annually by the local people for fuel, fodder and other uses. Though, the current level of extraction may be sustainable in the short run, insufficient regeneration is observed for long term sustainability. Forest biomass production was simulated for the next 30 years with a logistic growth model and the relative significance of input variables in influencing system behaviour was analysed through sensitivity analysis. The model results highlighted the declining forest resources in the long run. Positive response through appropriate government policies can, however, change the scenario for the better.'

Abstract: 'Soil depth generally varies in mountainous regions in rather complex ways. Conventional soil survey methods for evaluating the soil depth in mountainous and hilly regions require a lot of time, effort and consequently relatively large budget to perform. This study was conducted to explore the relationships between soil depth and topographic attributes in a hilly region in western Iran. For this, one hundred sampling points were selected using randomly stratified methodology, and considering all geomorphic surfaces including summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope and toeslope; and soil depth was actually measured. Eleven primary and secondary topographic attributes were derived from the digital elevation model (DEM) at the study area. The result of multiple linear regression indicated that slope, wetness index, catchment area and sediment transport index, which were included in the model, could explain about 76 % of total variability in soil depth at the selected site. This proposed approach may be applicable to other hilly regions in the semi-arid areas at a larger scale.'

Abstract: 'Diversity of vascular plants was studied in three sacred groves of the Jaintia Hills, in northeast India. About 395 species, 250 genera, and 108 families comprising pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms were found in the groves. Orchidaceae, Rubiaceae, Asteraceae and Lauraceae were dominant families and Ficus was the largest genus, with nine species. About 160 tree species were distributed in canopy, subcanopy and under canopy strata of the forest. Concentration of tropical and temperate elements of the neighbouring Sino-Himalayan and Burma-Malayan regions, and endemic (54 species), rare (31 species) and primitive taxa (38 species) due to favourable climatic conditions and prolonged protection have contributed to the high species richness of the groves. Their better management and protection is important for the conservation of plant diversity in the region and also for the benefit of indigenous tribes of the state.'

Title: 'Vulnerability of Forests in India: A National Scale Assessment'

Abstract: 'Forests are subjected to stress from climatic and non-climatic sources. In this study, we have reported the results of inherent, as well as climate change driven vulnerability assessments for Indian forests. To assess inherent vulnerability of forests under current climate, we have used four indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope. The assessment is presented as spatial profile of inherent vulnerability in low, medium, high and very high vulnerability classes. Fourty percent forest grid points in India show high or very high inherent vulnerability. Plantation forests show higher inherent vulnerability than natural forests. We assess the climate change driven vulnerability by combining the results of inherent vulnerability assessment with the climate change impact projections simulated by the Integrated Biosphere Simulator dynamic global vegetation model. While 46% forest grid points show high, very high, or extremely high vulnerability under future climate in the short term (2030s) under both representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5, such grid points are 49 and 54%, respectively, in the long term (2080s). Generally, forests in the higher rainfall zones show lower vulnerability as compared to drier forests under future climate. Minimizing anthropogenic disturbance and conserving biodiversity can potentially reduce forest vulnerability under climate change. For disturbed forests and plantations, adaptive management aimed at forest restoration is necessary to build long-term resilience.'

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02739365
Abstract: 'Patterns of feeding ecology among the living macaques conform poorly with recognized phyletic distinctions within the genus because there is an important ecological division which cross-cuts phyletic groupings. This division, between weed species and non-weed species, is based on the differing abilities of macaques to tolerate and even prosper in close association with human settlements. Based on available information about their ecology in the wild, we tentatively assign macaque species to these two categories. Finally, we consider the implications of our argument for scenarios of the initial spread of the macaques.'

Abstract: 'Western Ghats of India is recognized as one of the 12 mega diversity regions of the world and is the hot spot for unrevealed microbial diversity. To explore the diversity of polysaccharide degrading enzymes in that region, metagenomic library was constructed from forest soil of Southern Western Ghats region. Nine pectinolytic clones with the ability to degrade citrus pectin were isolated based on function based screening of the library. Sequence analysis of pg_4\xc2\xa0clone\xc2\xa0containing revealed that it contained GH family 28 domain (pfam00295) belonging to polygalacturonase superfamily (PLN03003). Its amino acid sequence analysis showed 25\xe2\x80\x9355\xc2\xa0% identity to the other well-characterized polygalacturonases. Molecular modeling of pg_4 revealed that it comprised of three right handed-parallel \xce\xb2 sheets, one anti-parallel \xce\xb2 sheet and one \xce\xb1 helix with three conserved catalytic residue D 2263, D 284-85 and H 312 at the C terminal end.

Abstract: 'The mahseers are an important group of fishes endemic to Asia with most species considered threatened. Conservation plans to save declining wild populations are hindered by unstable taxonomy, and detailed systematic review could form a solid platform for future management and conservation. D-loop and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) mtDNA sequences were examined in nine mahseer species of Tor, Neolissochilus, and Naziritor. Pseudogenes amplified in a portion of the species limited the utility of the D-loop region. ABGD analysis, NJ, ML, and MP methods and genetic distance (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G) using COI data revealed concordant species delimiting patterns. The three genera were monophyletic, separated as distinct clades (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.064 to 0.106), and Naziritor was flagged as a separate genus, distinct from Puntius (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.196). Out of seven nominal species known for Tor cogeners from India, only five were recovered with mtDNA data (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.000 to 0.037) and two species could not be distinguished with the molecular data set employed. Tor mosal, synonymized as Tor putitora, was rediscovered as a distinct species (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.031) based on its type locality. Tor mussulah was confirmed as a separate species (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.019 to 0.026). Two valid species, Tor macrolepis and T. mosal mahanadicus, were not distinct from T. putitora (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.00). The high divergence with mtDNA data failed to validate T. mosal mahanadicus as a subspecies of T. mosal (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.031). Morphological outliers discovered within the distribution range of Tor tor (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.022 to 0.025) shared the same lineage with T. putitora (TrN\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89I\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89G 0.002 to 0.005), indicating a new extended distribution of the Himalayan mahseer T. putitora in the rivers of the Indian central plateau. The findings indicate the need for integrating molecular and morphological tools for taxonomic revision of the Tor and Naziritor genera, so that taxa are precisely defined for accurate in situ and ex situ conservation decisions.'

Abstract: 'Deforestation is recognized as one of the most significant component in LULC and global changes scenario. It is imperative to assess its trend and the rates at which it is occurring. The changes will have long-lasting impact on regional climate and in turn on biodiversity. In North-East India, one of the recognized global biodiversity hotspots, approximately 30% of total forest cover is under pressure of rapid land use changes. This region harbors variety of rare and endemic species of flora and fauna. It also has a strong bearing on regional climatic conditions. Extensive shifting cultivation, compounded by increasing population pressure and demands for agriculture land are the prime drivers in addition to other proximate drivers of deforestation. It is therefore of prime concern to analyse forest cover changes in the region, assess rate of change and extent and to identify the areas, which show repetitive changes. We analyzed forest cover maps from six temporal datasets based on satellite data interpretation, converted to geospatial database since 1972 till 1999. The states of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura show highest changes in forest cover. Arunachal Pradesh shows least dynamic areas and maintains a good forest cover owing to its topographical inaccessibility in some areas. The present study reports the forest cover changes in the region using geospatial analysis and analyse them to devise proper management strategies.'

Abstract: 'In situ measurements of maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) in the Indian subcontinent are limited and do not present regional trends of intraplate stress orientation. The observed orientations of SHmax vary considerably and often differ from the plate velocity direction. We have simulated orientation and magnitude of SHmax through finite element modeling incorporating heterogeneities in elastic property of the Indian continent and plain stress approximation to understand the variability of SHmax. Four different scenarios are tested in simulation: (1) homogeneous plate with fixed plate boundary (2) homogeneous plate with boundary forces (3) heterogeneous plate with fixed boundary (4) heterogeneous plate with boundary forces. The estimated orientation and magnitude of SHmax with a heterogeneous plate with boundary forces in the Himalayan region and an eastern plate boundary comprising the Indo-Burmese arc and Andaman subduction zone are consistent with measured maximum horizontal stress. This study suggests that plate boundary force varies along the northern Indian plate margin and also provides a constraint on the intraplate stress field in the Indian subcontinent.'

Abstract: 'A procedure for the regeneration of complete plantlets of Tylophora indica from cultured leaf callus via somatic embryogenesis is described. Callus induction from leaf explants was on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with different concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2.4-D; 0.03\xe2\x80\x933 mg l\xe2\x88\x921; 0.0\xe2\x80\x9313.56 \xce\xbcM) and kinetin (Kn; 0.01 mg l\xe2\x88\x921; 0.05 \xce\xbcM). The best response for callus induction was obtained on MS medium containing 2 mg l\xe2\x88\x921 (9.04 \xce\xbcM) 2.4-D and 0.01 mg l\xe2\x88\x921 (0.05 \xce\xbcM) Kn. After two subeultures on the same medium the embryogenic callus was transferred to MS medium with different concentrations of the cytokinin, 6-benzyladenine (0.5\xe2\x80\x933 mg l\xe2\x88\x921; 2.22\xe2\x80\x9313.32 \xce\xbcM) and 2-isopentenyladenine (2ip; 0.53 mg l\xe2\x88\x921; 2.46\xe2\x80\x9314.76 \xce\xbcM) along with 0.01 mg l\xe2\x88\x921 (0.05 \xce\xbcM) indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) for somatic embryo development and maturation. MS medium with 2 mg l\xe2\x88\x921 (9.84 \xce\xbcM) 2ip produced the maximum number of mature somatic embryos. The mature embryos were bipolar and on transfer to MS basal medium produced complete plantlets. After hardening the regenerants were planted in the Gudalur forests of Western Ghats. Total DNA was extracted from 14 regenerants and the mother plant. Random amplified polymorphic, DNA (RAPD) analysis was carried out using 20 arbitrary oligonucleotides. The amplification products were monomorphic among all the plants revealing the genetic homogeneity and true-to-type nature of the regenerants.'

Abstract: 'Despite increasing recognition of the role spatial pattern can play in ecosystem function, few studies have quantified spatial heterogeneity in savanna ecosystems. The spatial distribution of herbaceous biomass and species composition was measured across three scales in a semi-arid savanna in central Kenya, and patterns were related to environmental variables at different scales. Herbaceous biomass declined across a rainfall gradient and from upper to lower topographic positions, but variation within a site (across 5\xe2\x80\x9350 m) was similar in magnitude to among-site variation associated with rainfall and topography. Geostatistical analyses showed that patchiness at scales of 5\xe2\x80\x9325 m explained 20% of total variation in herbaceous biomass. This pattern arose from the presence of both 5\xe2\x80\x9310-m diameter patches containing high herbaceous biomass (> 170 g m\xe2\x88\x922) and 5\xe2\x80\x9310-m diameter patches characterized by nearly bare soil surfaces (< 40 g m\xe2\x88\x922). Patch structure was contingent on topography, with larger bare patches at ridgeline and upper hillslope positions. Grass species distributions showed the greatest degree of patch structure and species turnover across distances of 5\xe2\x80\x9345 m. Additional community variation was associated with topography, with minimal variation in species composition across the rainfall gradient. Pattern diversity significantly exceeded levels reported for four other grassland ecosystems, suggesting fundamental differences in local processes generating spatial pattern. It is hypothesized that heterogeneously distributed grazing pressure, interacting with the distribution of shrub canopies, is an important factor generating such high levels of small-scale patch structure in this savanna.'

Abstract: 'Real-time medium-range weather forecasts (up to 10 days in advance) are prepared at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), India using the UK Met Office Unified Model (NCUM) system. In this study, the dynamical characteristics of systematic errors of the NCUM model at 17\xc2\xa0km horizontal resolution during the Indian summer monsoon (July and August 2017) are examined. It is found that the model has problem in maintaining the monsoon circulation and it weakens the monsoon by weakening the divergent winds over the Indian region. The model has a large spin up in global mean precipitation and evaporation from day-1 to day-3. In addition to the spin up problem, the model loses mass as the forecast length increases from day-1 to day-10. However, the mean\xc2\xa0surface pressure over India increases in forecasts from day-3 up to day-10. An anticyclonic circulation error over north Arabian Sea and adjoining region reduces moisture transport from the sea to the Indian land areas. The model has systematic tendency to forecast less rain as the forecast length increases. Differences between the ERA-Interim and the NCUM analysis in circulation and moisture parameters indicate uncertainties in the initial conditions and imbalance in moisture and divergence. Relationship between circulation errors and rainfall errors over a river basin (Mahanadi basin in Odisha) was studied. There is no linear relation between divergent or rotational components of wind errors and rainfall errors in forecasts over this basin. Even with a very small error in wind, the rainfall error could be as large as 10\xc2\xa0cm/day or more in the basin.'

Abstract: 'The mass-extinction episode underway is largely centred on tropical forests, insofar as they contain at least half of all Earth\'s species and they are being depleted faster than any other biome. But species distributions and depletion patterns are anything but uniform throughout the biome. This paper identifies 10 areas that, a) are characterised by exceptional concentrations of species with high levels of endemism and b) are experiencing unusually rapid rates of depletion. While these "hotspot" areas comprise less than 3.5 percent of remaining primary forests, they harbour over 34 000 endemic plant species (27 percent of all plant species in tropical forests and 13 percent of all plant species worldwide). They also feature 700 000 endemic animal species and possibly several times more. Unfortunately, they appear likely to lose 90 percent of their forest cover as soon as the end of the century or shortly thereafter, causing the extinction of almost 7 percent of Earth\'s plant species and at least a similar proportion of animal species, this occurring in only 0.2 percent of Earth\'s land surface. By concentrating on such areas where needs are greatestand where the pay-off from safeguard measures would also be greatest, conservationists can engage in a more systematised response to the challenge of largescale extinctions impending in tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'A plankton sample from Lake Devikulam, a temperate, high-altitude lake in the Western Ghat range, Kerala state, Southern India contained 24 rotifer species. Its interest lies in the fact that, beside widespread eurythermic, warm-water and one Paleotropical species, one or two new, possibly endemic species were found. The geographic and climatologic isolation of the temperate habitats of the Western Ghats may account for this peculiar taxocoenosis. Polyarthra indica sp. n. is described. The trophi morphology of three Polyarthra species is documented using scanning electron microscopy and its relevance to the taxonomy of Polyarthra discussed.'

Abstract: 'Conservation efforts globally are skewed toward terrestrial ecosystems. To date, conservation of aquatic ecosystems, in particular fish fauna, is largely neglected. We provide a country-wide assessment of Indian river ecosystems in order to identify and prioritize areas for protection and restoration of freshwater fish fauna. Using various biodiversity and anthropogenic attributes, coupled with tools of ecological modeling, we delineated areas for fish fauna conservation and restoration in the 20 major river basins of India. To do this, we used prioritization analyses and reserve selection algorithms to derive conservation value index (CVI) and vulnerability index (VI) of the river basins. CVI was estimated using endemicity, rarity, conservation value, and taxonomic singularity, while VI was estimated using a disturbance index derived from percent geographic area of the basin under human settlements, human population density, predominant land use, and total number of exotic fish species in each basin. The two indices, CVI and VI, were converted into geo-referenced maps, and each map was super-imposed onto species richness and forest cover maps, respectively. After superimposition, areas with high CVI and low VI shade intensities were delineated for conservation, while areas with high CVI and high VI shade intensities were demarcated for restoration. In view of the importance of freshwater fish for human livelihoods and consumption, and ecosystems of India\xe2\x80\x99s rivers, we call for urgent attention to the conservation of their fish fauna along with restoration of their degraded habitats.'

Title: "Consensus of the 'Malasars' traditional aboriginal knowledge of medicinal plants in the Velliangiri holy hills, India"

Abstract: 'There are many vanishing cultures that possess a wealth of knowledge on the medicinal utility of plants. The Malasars of Dravidian Tamils are an indigenous society occupying the forests of the Western Ghats, South India. They are known to be exceptional healers and keepers of traditional aboriginal knowledge (TAK) of the flora in the Velliangiri holy hills. In fact, their expertise is well known throughout India as evidenced by the thousands of pilgrims that go to the Velliangiri holy hills for healing every year. Our research is the first detailed study of medicinal plants in India that considers variation in TAK among informants using a quantitative consensus analysis. A total of 95 species belonging to 50 families were identified for medicinal and general health purposes. For each species the botanical name, family, local name, parts used, summary of mode of preparation, administration and curing are provided. The consensus analysis revealed a high level of agreement among the informants usage of a particular plant at a local scale. The average consensus index value of an informant was FIC > 0.71, and over 0.80 for some ailments such as respiratory and jaundice. Some of the more common problems faced by the Malasars were gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory illness, dermatological problems and simple illness such as fever, cough, cold, wounds and bites from poisonous animals. We also discovered several new ethnotaxa that have considerable medicinal utility. This study supports claims that the Malasars possess a rich TAK of medicinal plants and that many aboriginals and mainstream people (pilgrims) utilize medicinal plants of the Velliangiri holy hills. Unfortunately, the younger generation of Malasars are not embracing TAK as they tend to migrate towards lucrative jobs in more developed urban areas. Our research sheds some light on a traditional culture that believes that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment and we suggest that TAK such as that of the Malasars may serve toward a global lifestyle of health and environmental sustainability.'

Abstract: 'The proposed work describes a protocol for high-frequency in vitro regeneration through nodal segments and shoot tips in Decalepsis arayalpathra, a critically endangered medicinal liana of the Western Ghats. Nodal segments were more responsive than shoot tips in terms of shoot proliferation. Murashige and Skoog\xe2\x80\x99s (MS) basal medium supplemented with 5.0 \xce\xbcM 6-benzyladenine (BA) was optimum for shoot initiation through both the explants. Among different combinations of plant growth regulators and growth additive screened, MS medium added with 5.0 \xce\xbcM BA + 0.5 \xce\xbcM indole-3-acetic acid + 20.0 \xce\xbcM adenine sulphate effectuated the highest response: 11.8 shoots per nodal segment and 5.5 shoots per shoot tip with mean shoot length of 9.2 and 4.8 cm, respectively. Half-strength MS medium with 2.5 \xce\xbcM \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid was optimum for in vitro root induction. The plantlets with the well developed shoot and root were acclimatized in Soilrite\xe2\x84\xa2 with 92 % survival rate in the field conditions. During acclimatization, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate were gradually changed in dependence of formation of new leaves. Further, the changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) as well as activity of carbonic anhydrase were also observed: a continuous rise in SOD activity, but a rise and fall in the activities of CAT, APX, and GR were also noticed. Maximum fresh mass (3.1 g plant-1), dry mass (0.35 g plant-1) of roots and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde content of 9.22 \xce\xbcg cm-3(root extract) were recorded after 8 weeks of acclimatization.'

Abstract: 'The Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) Partnership, developed and managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG Kew), conserves propagules primarily from orthodox seed-bearing wild vascular plants. It is the largest ex situ conservation programme in the world, currently involving 96 countries and territories. Where possible, seeds are collected and conserved in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to RBG Kew\xe2\x80\x99s MSB for storage. In this paper we assess the conservation value of the germplasm stored at the MSB using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The MSB holdings represent a high quality, rich biological resource. Substantial and unique taxonomic diversity exists amongst the collections, representing 365 families, 5813 genera, 36,975 species and 39,669 taxa conserved. The collections cover a wide geographic range, originating from 189 countries and territories, representing all nine bio-geographic regions and all 35 biodiversity hotspots. The collections possess significant natural capital and population value: 32% of taxa, representing 49% of collections, have at least one identified use to humans; and 74% of taxa, representing 78% of collections, are either endemic, endangered (nationally or globally) and/or have an economic, ecological, social, cultural or scientific value. While 10% of taxa, representing >\xc2\xa08% of collections, are either extinct, rare or vulnerable to extinction at the global and/or national level, 20% of taxa, representing 13% collections, are endemic at the country or territory scale. Over the 17-year period since 2000 at least 11,182 seed samples, representing 12% of taxa and 8% of collections, have been distributed globally for conservation, research, education and display. This analysis highlighted collection gaps in MSB holdings in relation to their geographic representativeness, the taxonomic diversity of large families and genera of angiosperms, and coverage of threatened taxa. Further analysis across the entire MSB Partnership is required to underpin future collection activities and maximize the usefulness of collections.'

Abstract: 'Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 14 individuals belonging to 7 populations of Coscinium fenestratum (Gaertn.) Colebr. (Menispermaceae). 18 decamer primers used for the analysis generated 99 scorable bands of which 79 were found to be polymorphic. Coefficient of similarity ranged from 0.6604 to 0.9809. Variation within population was slightly higher than between populations. Similarity between individuals within and between populations was found. Dendrogram was obtained by using unwieghed pair-group method analysis (UPGMA). Distinct accession also exhibited higher percentage of medicinally active compound.'

Abstract: "Water is one of the basic resources of mankind and is vital to all forms of life. Although water is abundant covering 3/4 of the earth, yet it is a scarce resource; its universal use and the fact that only 3% is drinkable, makes its utilization and conservation, a most complicated problem, which has received inadequate attention. Water is like Shiva; it can create, preserve and destory. It is man's greatest friend and for; while it sustains life, it is a killer also. Water resources are limited but the demand for water continues to rise steeply, making the need most urgent for an efficient planning and implementation of programme of water resource appraisal, development, conservation and management."

Abstract: 'Fascinating and grand, with curious beaks and breeding habits, hornbills are a naturalist\xe2\x80\x99s delight. In forest types ranging from open savannah to rainforest across Africa and Asia, they occupy the pride of place among birds and play a pivotal role as mutualistic frugivores and seed dispersers of various trees. Due to the impact of humans on hornbills and their habitats, most species are now endangered. Fortunately, there has been some success in recent conservation efforts to save these magnificent forest flagships.'

Title: 'Spatial prediction of soil erosion risk by remote sensing, GIS and RUSLE approach: a case study of Siruvani river watershed in Attapady valley, Kerala, India'

Abstract: 'Siruvani watershed with a surface area of 205.54\xc2\xa0km2 (20,554 hectare), forming a part of the Western Ghats in Attapady valley, Kerala, was chosen for testing RUSLE methodology in conjunction with remote sensing and GIS for soil loss prediction and identifying areas with high erosion potential. The RUSLE factors (R, K, LS, C and P) were computed from local rainfall, topographic, soil classification and remote sensing data. This study proved that the integration of soil erosion models with GIS and remote sensing is a simple and effective tool for mapping and quantifying areas and rates of soil erosion for the development of better soil conservation plans. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 14.917\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0h\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 and the computations suggest that about only 5.76% (1,184 hectares) of the area comes under the severe soil erosion zone followed by the high-erosion zone (11.50% of the total area). The dominant high soil erosion areas are located in the central and southern portion of the watershed and it is attributed to the shifting cultivation, and forest degradation along with the combined effect of K, LS and C factor. The RUSLE model in combination with GIS and remote sensing techniques also enables the assessment of pixel based soil erosion rate.'

Abstract: 'From 1983, there have been three decades of the application and development of radio telemetry for wildlife studies in India. In this article, we review 82 studies from India, covering 47 species from four taxonomic classes. We examine and discuss the trends in the selection of study species, habitats and objectives of radio-telemetry studies and the functional success of radio collars and tags. A strong bias for study species and study region is observed and researchers generally tend not to look beyond the traditional research questions. Habitats that are difficult to access, such as the Trans-Himalayas, the Himalayas and north-eastern India, are overlooked. Most of the studies aimed to infer primary information only, such as home range, migration and movement patterns and habitat preference (53.7%, 47.6% and 28.1% studies, respectively). We expect these trends to change with time as the development of technology allows researchers to explore further. We investigated the tracking histories of 483 animals and the records of 496 radio collars or tags, but detailed information could be acquired for only 330 collars or tags. Of the collars, 49% malfunctioned before the end of their anticipated life due to a variety of reasons, early battery drainage being the prevalent cause. The performance of different technologies and collar manufacturers was also analysed but the small sample size was an issue for most of the cases. Argos-based collars and tags generally failed to record most of the locations precisely and failed to transmit them successfully. Issues with permissions and capturing animals for tagging, particular to India, are also discussed. A uniform and centralized system for granting permissions and guidelines for capturing and handling animals would be beneficial to future telemetry studies.'

Abstract: 'Arunachal Pradesh, the easternmost part of India, is endowed with diverse natural resources and inhabited by a variety of ethnic groups that have developed skills to exploit the biotic resources of the region for food and medicines. Information on animals and animal parts as components of folk remedies used by local healers and village headmen of the Nyishi and Galo tribes in their respective West Siang and Subansiri districts were obtained through interviews and structured questionnaires. Of a total of 36 vertebrate species used in treatments of ailments and diseases, mammals comprised 50%; they were followed by birds (22%), fishes (17%), reptiles (8%) and amphibians (3%). Approximately 20 common complaints of humans as well as foot and mouth disease of cattle were targets of zootherapies. Most commonly treated were fevers, body aches and pains, tuberculosis, malaria, wounds and burns, typhoid, smallpox, dysentery and diarrhoea, jaundice, and early pregnancy pains. Very few domestic animal species (e.g., goat and cattle) were used zootherapeutically. More frequently it was wild animals, including endangered or protective species like hornbill, pangolin, clouded leopard, tiger, bear, and wolf, whose various parts were either used in folk remedies or as food. Some of the animal-based traditional medicines or animal parts were sold at local markets, where they had to compete with modern, western pharmaceuticals. To record, document, analyze and test the animal-derived local medicines before they become replaced by western products is one challenge; to protect the already dwindling populations of certain wild animal species used as a resource for the traditional animal-derived remedies, is another.'

Abstract: 'The rain shadow regions requisite a comprehensive watershed development and management plan for sustainable water resources management. The Pambar River Basin (PRB) lies on the rain shadow region of the southern Western Ghats, India, where climate showed marked intra-basin variation. A morphometric analysis was done to evaluate the drainage characteristics of PRB using topographical maps and digital elevation data. PRB was divided into eighteen 4th order basins (SB1-SB18), distributed along various climatic gradients. Lower order streams mostly dominate PRB and drainage pattern is a function of relief and structure. The terrain is highly dissected and prone to soil erosion during heavy storms and the elongated shape of PRB enables easier flood management. The influence of climate on drainage characteristics was evidently emphasized in basin morphometry. Four distinctively different classes were identified based on the morphometric similarities. The significance of morphometric analysis on the hydrological characterization is discussed and the relevance of the present study in water harvesting has been explicated.'

Abstract: 'Water demand in India is growing due to its increasing population, economic growth and urbanization. Consequently, knowledge of interdependencies of large-scale hydrometeorological processes is crucial for efficient water resources management. Estimates of Groundwater (GW) derived from Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data provided by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission along with various other satellite observations and model estimates now facilitates such investigations. In an attempt which is first of its kind in India, this study proposes Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based spatiotemporal analysis of Precipitation (P), Evapotranspiration (ET), Surface Soil Moisture (SSM), Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM), TWS and GW to understand such interdependencies at intra- and interannual time scales. Results indicate that 84\xe2\x80\x9399% of the total variability is explained by the first 6 ICs of all the variables, analyzed for a period 2002\xe2\x80\x932014. The Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is the causative-factor of the first component describing 61\xe2\x80\x9382% of the total variability. The phase difference between all seasonal components of P and that of RZSM and ET is a month whereas it is 2\xc2\xa0months between the seasonal components of P and that of SSM, TWS and GW. ET is observed to be largely dependent on RZSM while GW appears as the major component of TWS. GW and TWS trends of opposite nature were observed in northern and southern part of India caused by inter-annual rainfall variability. These findings when incorporated in modelling frameworks would improve forecasts resulting in better water management.'

Title: 'Diversity and genetic structure of teak (Tectona grandis L.f) in its natural range using DNA microsatellite markers'

Abstract: 'Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is considered to be an extraordinarily durable building timber with a worldwide reputation. Its widespread use has entailed the over-exploitation of natural forests and a large reduction in natural diversity. Fifteen microsatellite markers were used to study the genetic variability and structure of 166 teak trees distributed over the whole natural area of teak. Analysis showed that in the teak natural area there were four main centers of genetic variability. Two clusters were in India and could be considered as main centers of genetic diversity in teak. The third cluster mainly consisting of populations in Thailand and Laos was genetically very distinct from the Indian populations but presented only half as much allelic variability. A fourth cluster from Central Laos showed even less genetic variability. The use of SSR markers for conservation of teak forest diversity is discussed.'

Abstract: 'We studied the ranging pattern of the wild black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) at Xiaochangdu, Tibet from June 2003 to March 2005. Using the map grid cell method, the group home range were 16.75 km2 in summer, 10.50 km2 in winter, and 21.25 km2 total over two years. The daily travel length (DTL) averaged 765 m with a range of 350\xe2\x80\x933500 m. The results showed that DTL in winter was significantly shorter than those of in summer and spring. Temperature, rainfall, food availability, and human disturbance correlated positively with DTL. According to the maximum observed group size and estimated total home range, population density and biomass of R. bieti were 9.1 individuals/km2 and 88.6 kg/km2, respectively. The temporal and spatial variations of food resources and patterns of human disturbance largely determine the ranging behavior of R. bieti at Xiaochangdu.'

Abstract: 'An efficient protocol was developed for short-term storage and conservation of a woody medicinal climber, Decalepis hamiltonii, using encapsulated nodal segments. The encapsulation of nodal segments was significantly affected by the concentrations of sodium alginate (Na-alginate) and calcium chloride (CaCl2\xc2\xb72H2O). A gelling matrix of 4\xc2\xa0% Na-alginate and 100\xc2\xa0mM CaCl2\xc2\xb72H2O was found most suitable for the production of ideal Ca-alginate beads. Maximum shoot re-growth (77.00\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.09\xc2\xa0%) was recorded on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with 5.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM 6-benzyladenine (BA), 0.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 30.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM adenine-sulphate (ADS).

Abstract: 'Homegardens are recognized worldwide as sustainable agroforestry systems that are repositories of species and genetic diversity. Species diversity and composition of homegardens are influenced by a number of environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. The present study examines the tree species diversity in the homegardens of different cultural groups of Barak Valley, Assam, Northeast India. Complete enumeration was done for diversity analysis in 181 homegardens from 38 villages in the three districts of the Valley. Factors affecting plant diversity were analyzed, and the floristic composition of the homegardens was found to vary with garden size, ethnicity of the homegarden owners, and geographical parameters such as location and altitude. Results indicate high plant diversity, with a total of 161 tree species identified from 47 families. Tea garden labor communities were comparatively found to hold more diversity in their homegardens. Similarity and cluster analysis revealed the distinctness of the majority of the homegardens, and seven groups of homegardens with very low distance were revealed. Homegardens were also found to maintain considerable conservation value as repositories of many underutilized, wild, and rare plant species. Biodiversity conservation in the homegardens was found to be linked to the multiple values of the different plant species to the homegardeners and further highlight the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cconservation through use\xe2\x80\x9d approach. For the preservation of such traditional agroforestry systems, which also have the potential to provide options for adaptation to climate change, proper documentation of traditional knowledge concerning the different plant species and the human-nature interaction in the homegardens is necessary before such systems are completely lost.'

Title: 'Enhancing spider families and spider webs in Indian rice fields for conservation biological control, considering local and landscape management'

Abstract: 'Spiders are omnipresent, occurring in almost all terrestrial habitats. They are generalist predators and important for conservation biocontrol in agricultural fields, helping to reduce pesticide applications. In this study, we examined how spider families and spider web types in rice fields are related to local and landscape management. Samples were taken in differently managed rice fields adjoining either homegarden polycultures or banana monocultures. Furthermore, landscape structure, prey abundance, herb richness and cover were taken into account. The results showed that prey availability explained most of the variation in spiders and their web\xe2\x80\x99s abundance, indicating that spiders in the rice fields can potentially contribute to pest control. Adjacent habitat had no effect on the spider populations, but maintaining fallow fields in the surrounding landscape seems to be a useful measure to promote Erigoninae in rice fields. There was no evidence that local management practices such as fertiliser and pesticide use had an impact on spider families, which appeared to be due to the low level of these inputs. Spider web sampling can complement spider sampling as it detects spiders hidden at the base of the rice tillers, which are likely to be missed by sweep netting. Additionally, tetragnathid webs are easy to observe and thus can be used as an indication for farmers not to spray pesticides as spiders are potentially controlling the pest species. Interviews with farmers made clear that many farmers in the study area showed their interest in management methods that promote biological pest control.'

Abstract: 'The conservation of Himalayan forests is big concern in view of global agenda. Many studies in this endeavor reported that the rate of forests degradation is posing a severe threat to the landscape and existing biodiversity in the Himalayas. Currently there many conservation approaches exists and of them four are widely recognized (1) Conservation through traditional religious beliefs \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional conserved forests\xe2\x80\x9d (TCF); (2) Conservation through governmental planning and schemes \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment conserved forests\xe2\x80\x9d (GCF); (3) Conservation through creation of protected areas (PAF); and (4) Conservation through community efforts \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity conserved forests\xe2\x80\x9d (CCF). Our hypothesis in this direction says that all the conservation approaches lead to same results concerning to forest conservation. To testify our hypothesis we have studied the forests of each conservation regimes and evaluated them based on the identified indicators. We have done empirical studies and following the cloud-free satellite data were used for last three decades (such as Multi-Spectral Scanner, Linear Imaging and Self Scanning, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper ) to study a change in vegetation dynamics of the mountain forests in multi-temporal dimension. Our research concluded that community conservation approach have greater significance for biodiversity conservation and management in the Himalayan region. Here we support the model of CCF for forest ecosystem conservation, alongside the sustainable livelihood of the mountain societies. But every conservation regimes has its own importance in viewpoint of the particular objectives. Therefore, we suggests advancement and revision of PAF and GCF however, some elements of CCF can be introduced in TCF for making up it more sound in view of rapid socio-economic and cultural changes taking place in the communities.'

Abstract: 'The people of Manipur, a state in northeast India, follow ancestral worship and animism in the form of deity worship, with the central focus on worship in forest patches. The beliefs and taboos associated with the Sylvan deities (Umanglais) in the forest patches are restricted to any sort of disturbance of flora and fauna. These social boundaries help to conserve the entire organism as a whole, which stand the concept of sacred groves. The pleasing of deities is performed every year by the Meiteis, a dominant community of Manipur, in honour of the deities and to gain their favour. Indigenous cultural and rituals practices of the local people in sacred groves serve as a tool for conserving biodiversity. Sacred groves are distributed over a wide ecosystem and help in conservation of rare and endemic species. Well-preserved sacred groves are store houses of valuable medicinal and other plants having high economic value, and serve as a refuge to threatened species. One hundred and sixty-six sacred groves were inventoried in Manipur valley that comprises Imphal east, Imphal west, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts of the state. Detailed studies were carried out in four selected sacred groves, to know the importance of biodiversity status and vegetation characteristics. A total of 173 plant species representing 145 genera under 70 families were recorded through baseline floristic survey. The species diversity indices were compared among the four studied groves. The vegetation composition and community characteristics were recorded. Ethnobotanical uses of species were examined, which reveal that 96% of the species were used as medicine for the treatment of various ailments. Utilization of herbal medicine by the Meiteis is closely related to the cultural and ritual practices. A few of the medicinal plants which have disappeared from the locality are now confined only to the groves. Socio-cultural aspects were investigated taking into account the attitudes of local people, which indicate social beliefs and taboo are eroding, simultaneously degrading the degree of protection of sacred groves. Therefore, conservation measures of sacred groves need to be formulated considering the factor of degradation and the basic necessities of the local people. Until and unless a viable option is provided to the local people (especially those who habitat nearby the adjoining areas) for sustaining their economic condition, no step for conservation of biodiversity will be successful.'

Abstract: 'The taxonomy of the Hanuman langur (Semnopithecus spp.), a widely distributed Asian colobine monkey, has been in a flux for a long time due to much disagreement between various classification schemes. However, results from a recent field-based morphological study were consistent with Hill\xe2\x80\x99s (Ceylon J Sci 21:277\xe2\x80\x93305, 1939) species level classification scheme. Here we tested the validity of S. hypoleucos and S. priam, the two South Indian species recognized by Hill. To this end, one mitochondrial and four nuclear markers were sequenced from over 72 non-invasive samples of Hanuman langurs and S. johnii collected from across India. The molecular data were subjected to various tree building methods. The nuclear data was also used in a Bayesian structure analysis and to determine the genealogical sorting index of each hypothesized species. Results from nuclear data suggest that the South Indian population of Hanuman langur consists of two units that correspond to the species recognized by Hill. However in the mitochondrial tree S. johnii and S. priam were polyphyletic probably due to retention of ancestral polymorphism and/or low levels of hybridization. Implications of these results on conservation of Hanuman langurs are also discussed.'

Abstract: 'In the present communication habitat ecology, species diversity; distribution and different indices of fish biodiversity management were studied in a Central India river (River Betwa, a tributary of River Ganga basin approved under India\xe2\x80\x99s first river linking plan). Correlation between fish species richness with the hydrological attributes showed good relationship and water depth, dissolved oxygen and pH were found the most important variables in shaping fish assemblage. Altogether, sixty-three fish species belonging to 20 families and 45 genera were collected from five sampling stations spread along the upstream, mid stream and lower streams. Cyprinids were the most dominated group represented by 26 species belonging to 15 genera, followed by Bagridae (6 species from 3 genera), and Schilbeidae (4 species from 4 genera). The distribution of fish showed interesting pattern and about 10% species were common to all the sites showing long migration range. Shannon-Weiner diversity index showed considerable variation and ranged from 1.89 to 3.51. Out of 63 species status of 10 species were not known due to data deficit, 29 categorized as lower risk, 14 as vulnerable, 8 as endangered, while the remaining two species were introduced. Our study shows that the River supports considerable diversity of the fishes and is important for conservation and about 34% fish fauna is threatened being either vulnerable or endangered. We assessed that the river supports considerable percentage of food fish (89.47), ornamental fish (49.12%) and sport fish (5.26%). Among the eight major types of fish habitats identified along the entire stretch of river, open river, shallow water and deep pools were habitats contributing maximum diversity. Fish species richness (FSR) were significantly different (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in all the habitats except channel confluence and scour pool. Trophic niche model may be useful for assessing altered as well as less altered fish habitat of the tropical rivers. Since this river will be interlinked in near future, this study would be useful for conservation planning and management and also for future assessment after interlinking. Issues related to various threats to aquatic environment and conservation management strategies have been discussed.'

Abstract: 'Three explants namely, nodal, internodal and petiolar segments were used to establish in vitro cultures of Piper longum. Multiple shoots were induced on semi-solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1\xc2\xa0mg/l 6-benzyladenine (BA). Addition of ascorbic acid (40\xc2\xa0mg/l) considerably reduced browning of tissue and medium. Best shoot regeneration was observed from petiolar explants and was, therefore, used for all further studies. An indexing method was introduced for checking bacterial contamination in well established shoot multiplication cultures. It was found that bacterial infection was quite high in shoots derived from nodal and internodal explants while it was least in those obtained from petiolar segments. Only shoots that indexed negative for endogenous bacteria were used for proliferation and in vitro conservation studies. At the end of 4\xc2\xa0weeks in proliferation medium which consisted of MS supplemented with 0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l BA and 40\xc2\xa0mg/l ascorbic acid as many as 22 shoot buds of 41\xc2\xa0mm length could be obtained. Shoot buds developed into clusters for ease of further proliferation. A step of shoot elongation for 2\xc2\xa0weeks in liquid MS basal medium was found to be beneficial for getting long and healthy shoots for rooting. Single shoots were rooted in 0.25\xc2\xa0mg/l indole butyric acid that could be successfully acclimatized under nethouse conditions. A conservation strategy was also developed. The shoot cultures could be maintained without subculturing for as long as 8\xc2\xa0weeks in MS medium supplemented with 1\xc2\xa0mg/l paclobutrazol (PBZ) and 40\xc2\xa0mg/l ascorbic acid.'

Abstract: 'Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum Maton) has great commercial value as a spice crop in India. A one-step protocol for direct regeneration of plants and in vitro conservation by slow growth method has been developed. A maximum of 6.5\xc2\xa0shoots/culture were obtained in 2\xc2\xa0mo or 15.1\xc2\xa0shoots/culture in 4\xc2\xa0mo on Murashige and Skoog (Physiol Plant 15:473\xe2\x80\x93497, 1962) medium (MS)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x895\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM benzylaminopurine gelled with 0.7% agar (micropropagation medium). Rooting also occurred simultaneously on the same medium. Using one shoot tip or nodal explant, about 30,375 plants can be regenerated in a year on the micropropagation medium. In vitro conservation by slow growth method was achieved on 1/2 MS (major salts)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x895\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BAP\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x890.7% agar (conservation medium); about 70% of the cultures survived up to 18\xc2\xa0mo at 25\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb0C. Successful regrowth of plants on micropropagation medium was obtained by culturing nodal explants excised from 18-mo-old conserved plants. Some 96% of the plants survived the hardening treatment and grew normally in a greenhouse. If 24 cultures are conserved on the conservation medium, it is possible to regenerate at least 750 plants by using explants derived from 70% of the surviving shoots and culturing the same in micropropagation medium for 4\xc2\xa0mo. These plants may be used for planting or as a source of explants for the next conservation cycle. On the basis of 20 random amplified polymorphic DNA and 13 inter-simple sequence repeat primers analyses, no significant reproducible variation was detected among the in vitro-conserved plants compared with the mother plants.'

Abstract: 'In biodiversity-rich areas, both conservation and socioeconomic development are at the core of discussions among various stakeholders, such as local people, policymakers, conservationists, resource management professionals, economists, researchers/scientists, and so forth. Various innovations are being provided that aim at promoting both improved livelihood for the people and the conservation and management of natural resources in the Central Himalaya of India. Many studies point out the factors responsible for the tremendous decline of natural resources and also how they have affected the local people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood options. In this context, the current study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of various solutions/innovations that are being implemented in the Himalayas of India. Unfortunately, only a few are found to be successful in both conservation and sustainable livelihood development. This study reveals that people are still looking for more viable solutions that could help them improve their lifestyle, as well as facilitating ecosystem conservation and supporting existing biodiversity. Based on the present study, it is argued that an in-depth empirical study of any region is a necessary process prior to offering solutions to achieve the desired goals, as considered by development agencies and policy-planners.'

Title: 'Tourism as a threat to critically endangered and endangered birds: global patterns and trends in conservation hotspots'

Abstract: 'More than 12\xc2\xa0% of bird species are threatened with extinction. Numerous anthropogenic activities and processes are considered responsible for such declines, including tourism related activities. These activities often occur in global biodiversity hotspots but few\xc2\xa0studies consider the potential risks associated with tourism. The relative importance of tourism as a threat to birds was quantified using a global analysis of the threats facing critically endangered and endangered birds in the hotspots. Sixty-three critically endangered and endangered bird species are reportedly threatened by tourism. Among those 63 species, marine, coastal and aquatic birds are threatened more by tourism than was expected. Hotspots with the most species threatened by tourism are Polynesia\xe2\x80\x93Micronesia and the Mediterranean Basin. This study uses individual threatening processes in a new way to characterise hotspots for conservation action, advancing previous identification criteria. Analysing hotspots in terms of the relative presence of individual threatening processes may help to more effectively direct future research in these priority regions.'

Abstract: 'Forest fragmentation is one of the most important threats to global biodiversity, particularly in tropical developing countries. Identifying priority areas for conservation within these forests is essential to their effective management. However, this requires current, accurate environmental information that is often lacking in developing countries. The Cockpit Country, Jamaica, contains forests of international importance in terms of levels of endemism and overall diversity. These forests are under severe threat from the prospect of bauxite mining and other anthropogenic disturbances. In the absence of adequate, up-to-date ecological information, we used satellite remote sensing data and fragmentation analysis to identify interior forested areas that have experienced little or no change as priority conservation sites. We classified Landsat images from 1985, 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2008, using an object-oriented method, which allowed for the inclusion of roads. We conducted our fragmentation analysis using metrics to quantify changes in forest patch number, area, shape, and aggregation. Deforestation and fragmentation fluctuated within the 23-year period but were mostly confined to the periphery of the forest, close to roads and access trails. An area of core forest that remained intact over the period of study was identified within the largest forest patch, most of which was located within the boundaries of a forest reserve and included the last remaining patches of closed-broadleaf forest. These areas should be given highest priority for conservation, as they constitute important refuges for endemic or threatened biodiversity. Minimizing and controlling access will be important in maintaining this core.'

Abstract: 'Plant invasion is highly responsive to rising temperature, altered precipitation and various anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, climate anomalies might provide opportunities to identify the relationship of past climate in deriving the distribution of invasive species and to detect their probable future distribution. In this work, we studied the correlation of climate anomaly i.e. temperature and precipitation with an indicative map of plant invasive species (1\xc2\xb0 grid) of India. The indicative map was generated through the plant data available from the project \xe2\x80\x98Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level\xe2\x80\x99. Climate anomaly was calculated and represented by average temperature and precipitation using \xe2\x80\x98Climate Research Unit\xe2\x80\x99 data for the period of 1901 to 2000. A comparison of local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and a global ordinary least square regression (OLS) model was carried out for statistical analysis to depict the correlation at 1\xc2\xb0 spatial grids. Overall, 20,501 records with a total of 9112 unique plots and 161 unique invasive species were recorded in the database that shows a maximum of 15 invasive species in a 0.04\xc2\xa0ha nested quadrat. Cumulative analysis showed a maximum of 53 invasive species at 1\xc2\xb0 grid. Individually, GWR could reveal a significant correlation with invasive species distribution for temperature anomaly (r2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.73, AIC=\xe2\x80\x892206) and precipitation anomaly (r2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.74, AIC=\xe2\x80\x892221), while OLS model did not offer a good correlation (r2\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001, AIC\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x892400) compared to GWR. Combination of temperature and precipitation anomaly (shared model) showed an improved spatial correlation (r2\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.75) using GWR. Variation partitioning revealed the dominant influence (>\xe2\x80\x890.40 of variation) of temperature anomaly over Deccan Peninsula, Himalaya and North East zone. Influence of precipitation anomaly was more prominent over arid and semi-arid zone explaining >\xe2\x80\x890.35 of variation. Results revealed the strength of GWR to see the interaction of invasive plant species w.r.t. climate anomalies that explain the influence of spatial variation due to heterogeneity at varying neighbour distances. The significant correlation of invasive species with both the anomalies revealed the affinity of invasive species towards warmer, drier and wet places. This gives an indication that the distribution of invasive species could be triggered by climate anomaly. The use of other predictor variables (i.e. edaphic and anthropogenic) could be an inclusive input in a future perspective.'

Abstract: 'Landscapes consist of heterogeneous interacting dynamic elements with complex ecological, economic and cultural attributes. These complex interactions help in the sustenance of natural resources through bio-geochemical and hydrological cycling. The ecosystem functions are altered with changes in the landscape structure. Fragmentation of large contiguous forests to small and isolated forest patches either by natural phenomena or anthropogenic activities leads to drastic changes in forest patch sizes, shape, connectivity and internal heterogeneity, which restrict the movement leading to inbreeding among Meta populations with extirpation of species.'

Abstract: ' Rhododendron nilagiricum Zenk is the only paleoendemic species of Rhododendron found at Nilgiris. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was carried out to study the extent of genetic polymorphism in trees collected from five locations at Nilgiris. Of the 15 primers tested, 10 revealed polymorphism. The percentage polymorphism ranged from 40 to 92 with an average of 61.5 polymorphism per primer. Pair wise comparisons were made for the RAPD profiles obtained through the use of 10 primers in the representative samples. Data analysis was done by using the POPGENE statistical package. The similarity matrix and the dendrogram obtained showed that there was close similarity between trees collected from different regions of Nilgiris. The cluster analysis showed positive correspondence between genetic diversity and geographic distance. Primer OPZ 13 generated the highest number of bands among the primers, revealed maximum polymorphism and had the greatest capacity for discriminating individuals of R. nilagiricum collected from different regions of Nilgiris.'

Abstract: 'The paper provides an overview of the developments in hydrobiological studies in India during the past fifty years, and links them with a historical perspective of the pre-independence studies. Hydrobiological studies which were well developed in the beginning of this century, gained momentum soon after independence as all kinds of aquatic habitats were investigated for the assessment, conservation and optimum utilization of inland fishery resources of the country. However, the environmental issues which dominated since the 1972 Stockholm Conference, and growing realization of the problem of water pollution, resulted in a rapid proliferation of hydrobiological studies which tend to focus on correlation between the distribution of various organisms and degree of water pollution or the effects of various organic and inorganic pollutants. A sampling of published literature reveals that long-term, analytical and experimental studies of the whole ecosystems (natural or experimental), and studies of population interactions, biomanipulation, food chain dynamics, and energy flows are wholly lacking. The paper calls for the strengthening of field and laboratory facilities, and establishment of regional and national institutes of aquatic ecology which will be necessary for the management of both the water quality and aquatic biological resources for sustainable development.'

Abstract: 'The south Asian summer monsoon from June to September accounts for the greater part of the annual rainfall over most of India and southeast Asia. The evolution of the summer and winter monsoon circulations over India is examined on the basis of the surface and upper air data of stations across India. The salient features of the seasonal reversals of temperature and pressure gradients and winds and the seasonal and synoptic fluctuations of atmospheric humidity are discussed. The space-time variations of rainfall are considered with the help of climatic pentad rainfall charts and diagrams. The rainfall of several north and central Indian stations shows a minimum around mid-August and a maximum around mid-February which seem to be connected with the extreme summer and winter positions of the ITCZ and the associated north-south shifts in the seasonal circulation patterns. Attention is drawn to the characteristic features of the monsoon rainfall that emerge from a study of daily and hourly rainfall of selected stations. Diurnal variations of temperature, pressure, wind and rainfall over the monsoon belt are briefly treated.'

Abstract: 'There is huge knowledge gap in our understanding of many terrestrial carbon cycle processes. In this paper, we investigate the bounds on terrestrial carbon uptake over India that arises solely due to CO  2  -fertilization. For this purpose, we use a terrestrial carbon cycle model and consider two extreme scenarios: unlimited CO2-fertilization is allowed for the terrestrial vegetation with CO2 concentration level at 735\xc2\xa0ppm in one case, and CO2-fertilization is capped at year 1975 levels for another simulation. Our simulations show that, under equilibrium conditions, modeled carbon stocks in natural potential vegetation increase by 17 Gt-C with unlimited fertilization for CO2 levels and climate change corresponding to the end of 21st century but they decline by 5.5 Gt-C if fertilization is limited at 1975 levels of CO2 concentration. The carbon stock changes are dominated by forests. The area covered by natural potential forests increases by about 36% in the unlimited fertilization case but decreases by 15% in the fertilization-capped case. Thus, the assumption regarding CO2-fertilization has the potential to alter the sign of terrestrial carbon uptake over India. Our model simulations also imply that the maximum potential terrestrial sequestration over India, under equilibrium conditions and best case scenario of unlimited CO2-fertilization, is only 18% of the 21st century SRES A2 scenarios emissions from India. The limited uptake potential of the natural potential vegetation suggests that reduction of CO2 emissions and afforestation programs should be top priorities.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity loss is a problem of global concern affecting ecosystem functioning and services provided to humans. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is built on a conceptual framework that links biodiversity with the services ecosystems provide to society and human welfare. Numerous empirical studies have measured ecosystem goods and services in terms of economic values; however, less evidence is available of the indirect effect of biodiversity on these values. Based on this, we first compile market and non-market forest valuation studies and, secondly, explore the potential of an econometric modelling exercise by conducting a worldwide meta-analysis. This exercise aims to highlight the role of biodiversity indicators on valuation. In this way, we can study the underlying transmission mechanisms that explain to what extent biodiversity is related to human welfare. Furthermore, we also propose to evaluate the magnitudes of the respective distributional impacts, including the different ecosystem goods and services under consideration. Our results show that biodiversity indicators may have an underlying effect on forest ecosystem values, which also depend on the type of ecosystem services. Lastly, the results are discussed and analysed with respect to their policy implications concerning biodiversity conservation.'

Abstract: 'The two species of yellow catfish, Horabagrus brachysoma and H. nigricollaris are categorized as \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98critically endangered\xe2\x80\x99 respectively in their wild habitat. Proper knowledge of genetic structure and variability of these endangered species are highly essential for the management, conservation and improvement of fish stocks. Therefore, genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships between these species of yellow catfish sampled from Chalakkudy River in the hot spot of biodiversity-Western Ghats region, Kerala, India were analyzed by using Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers. 85 RAPD and five microsatellites loci were detected to analyze the genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships among these species. Out of 85 RAPD loci produced only 52.94% were polymorphic whereas in microsatellite, all 5 loci were polymorphic (100%). Species-specific RAPD bands were found in both species studied. In microsatellite, the number of alleles across the five loci ranged from 1 to 8. The observed heterozygosities in H. brachysoma and H. nigricollaris were 0.463 and 0.443, respectively. Here, both RAPD and microsatellite methods reported a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in both species of Horabagrus which strongly emphasize the need of fishery management, conservation and rehabilitation of these species.'

Abstract: 'The present study was undertaken in five major forest types (dominated by Quercus semecarpifolia, Quercus floribunda, Acer acuminatum, Abies pindrow and Aesculus indica, respectively) between 2400 and 2850 m a.s.l. in a moist temperate forest of the Mandal-Chopta area in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India. The aim was to assess the variation in composition and diversity in different vegetation layers, i.e., herb, shrub and tree, among these five forest types. Diversity indices, such as the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, density, total basal cover, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s concentration of dominance index, Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s diversity index, Pielou\xe2\x80\x99s equitability, species richness, species heterogeneity and \xce\xb2-diversity, were calculated to understand community structures. Dominance-diversity curves were drawn to ascertain resource apportionment among various species in different forest types.'

Abstract: 'Samples of the spotted murrel (Channa punctatus) were collected from three rivers of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The allozyme variation of C. punctatus was investigated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Eighteen enzymes were detected, but only 10 (EST, PGM, G3PDH, G6PDH, SOD, GPI, ODH, GDH, XDH, and CK) showed consistent phenotypic variations. Allele frequencies were estimated at the 18 polymorphic loci representing 10 enzymes. Two rare alleles, EST-4*C and G6PDH-2*C, were noted in the Tamirabarani and Kallada populations but were absent in the Siruvani population. The allele frequencies of the Tamirabarani and Kallada populations were similar, except for a few loci. Among the three populations, the maximum genetic distance (0.026) and FST (0.203) were found between the geographically distant Siruvani and Kallada populations. Overall the study showed that among the three populations, the Tamirabarani and Kallada have similar genetic structures.'

Abstract: 'There is a constant need for novel antibiotic and antioxidant sources due to the ever-increasing resilience of pathogens and the occurrence of chronic diseases. The natural sources of these agents have advantages due to lower production cost, structural variation, and uses of active compounds for pharmaceutical uses. The microbes living in planta termed \xe2\x80\x9cendophytes\xe2\x80\x9d are alternative sources of host bioactive compounds. In this study, ten endophytic fungi were isolated from Polygonum chinense L. and identified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer regions. The fungal strains were fermented and the ethyl acetate extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial and antioxidant capacities. Almost 80% of the endophytes showed antibacterial potency against one or more pathogenic bacteria. Among all strains, Penicillium canescens showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as well as significant antioxidative and DNA protective capacities. The strain Fusarium chlamydosporum displayed significant anti-radical (126.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x896.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml) and ferric reducing (84.7\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0AA/g dry extract) capacities. The bio-autography, chromatography, and mass spectroscopy analyses of P. canescens extract revealed the presence of sesquiterpene (germacrene), plasticizer (phthalic acid ester) along with phenolic acids, flavonoid (quercetin), and short chain hydrocarbons. The secondary metabolites of F. chlamydosporum were identified with phenolic acids as bioactive compounds by chromatography and mass spectroscopy. This study indicates P. chinense endophytes as potential sources of antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds for novel drug discovery.'

Abstract: 'Large connected landscapes are paramount to maintain top predator populations. Across their range, tiger (Panthera tigris) populations occur in small fragmented patches of habitat, often isolated by large distances in human-dominated landscapes. We assessed connectivity between 16 protected areas (PAs) in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, using data on land use and land cover, human population density, and transportation infrastructure. We identified and prioritized movement routes using a combination of least-cost corridor modeling and circuit theory. Our analyses suggest that there are several opportunities to maintain connectivity in this landscape. We mapped a total of thirty-five linkages in the region and calculated metrics to estimate their quality and importance. The highest quality linkages as measured by the ratio of cost-weighted distance to Euclidean distance are Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen/Bandhavgarh\xe2\x80\x93SanjayGhasidas/Melghat\xe2\x80\x93Satpura, and cost-weighted distance to least-cost path length are Nawegaon\xe2\x80\x93Tadoba/Achanakmar\xe2\x80\x93SanjayGhasidas/Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen. We used current flow centrality to evaluate the contribution of each PA and linkage toward facilitating animal movement. Values are highest for Kanha and Pench tiger reserves, and the linkages between Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen, Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Pench, and Pench\xe2\x80\x93Satpura, suggesting that these PAs and linkages play a critical role in maintaining connectivity in central India. In addition, smaller areas such as Bor, Nawegaon, and Phen have high centrality scores relative to their areas and thus may act as important stepping stones. We mapped pinch points, which are sections of the linkages where tiger movement is restricted due to unfavorable habitat, transportation networks, human habitation, or a combination of factors. Currently, very limited data exist on tiger movement outside of PAs to validate model results. Regional-scale connectivity mapping efforts can assist managers and policy makers to develop strategic plans for balancing wildlife conservation and other land uses in the landscape.'

Abstract: 'The goal of biodiversity hotspots is to identify regions around the world where conservation priorities should be focused. We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a 300\xc2\xa0m pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than 10\xc2\xa0% forest cover in protected areas. San F\xc3\xa9lix-San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests, Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than 500\xc2\xa0km2, forest cover is less than 50\xc2\xa0km2, and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions. This should improve our ability to compare, prioritize, and monitor forests in biodiversity hotspots.'

Abstract: 'Camptothecin (CPT), a monoterpene indole alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I (Top 1). Because of this property, several derivatives of CPT are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents. The compound is produced by several plant species, including Nothapodytes nimmoniana (Family: Icacinaceae) presumably as a deterrent to insect pests. Here, we report, a lepidopteran larva, Lymantria sp. of Lymantriidae family which feeds voraciously on the leaves of N. nimmoniana, without any adverse consequences. Larval body weight and molting period were unaffected despite captive feeding of the larva with CPT enriched leaves. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that nearly 46% of the ingested CPT was excreted while the rest was sequestered predominantly in the exuviae and setae (~35%). Although most of the CPT was in the parental form as found in the plant, traces of inactive, sulfated forms of CPT were recovered from the larva. Compared to that in plant, there were no critical mutations at the CPT binding domain of the insect\xe2\x80\x99s Top 1. The gut pH of the larva was alkaline (pH\xc2\xa010.0). The alkaline gut environment converts CPT from its active, lactone form to inactive, carboxylate form. It is likely that such conversion might help the larva to reduce the overall burden of CPT in its gut. We discuss the results in the context of the mechanisms of resistance adapted by insects to plant toxins.'

Abstract: 'The order Carnivora is well represented in India, with 58 of the 250 species found globally, occurring here. However, small carnivores figure very poorly in research and conservation policies in India. This is mainly due to the dearth of tested and standardized techniques that are both cost effective and conducive to small carnivore studies in the field. In this paper we present a non-invasive genetic technique standardized for the study of Indian felids and canids with the use of PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of scat collected in the field.'

Abstract: 'Monthly mean measurements of surface temperature, albedo and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of NOAA AVHRR are processed for Maharashtra. These data are used in combination with monthly average surface meteorological observations in a surface energy balance model to estimate monthly mean actual evapotranspiration (AET) from different climatic zones of Maharasthra,. India. AET is estimated between April and December months for two contrasting monsoons in 1992 and 1995. Estimates reasonably agree with pan evaporation data during growing season and with AET estimated from water balance procedure. AET is low in semi-arid dry land areas of central Maharashtra and significantly high in the humid-perhumid western ghat region and subhumid eastern Maharashtra region. The modeled evapotranspiration show the influence of seasonal vegetation in different climatic zones from the region. The method can be used to obtain large-scale evapotranspiration with minimum ground observations.'

Abstract: 'Leaf phenology describes the seasonal cycle of leaf functioning and is essential for understanding the interactions between the biosphere, the climate and the atmosphere. In this study, we characterized the spatial patterns in phenological variations in eight contrasting forest types in an Indian region using coarse resolution NOAA AVHRR satellite data. The onset, offset and growing season length for different forest types has been estimated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Further, the relationship between NDVI and climatic parameters has been assessed to determine which climatic variable (temperature or precipitation) best explain variation in NDVI. In addition, we also assessed how quickly and over what time periods does NDVI respond to different precipitation events. Our results suggested strong spatial variability in NDVI metrics for different forest types. Among the eight forest types, tropical dry deciduous forests showed lowest values for summed NDVI (SNDVI), averaged NDVI (ANDVI) and integrated NDVI (I-NDVI), while the tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh had highest values. Within the different evergreen forest types, SNDVI, ANDVI and INDVI were highest for tropical wet evergreen forests, followed by tropical evergreen forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests and were least for tropical dry evergreen forests. Differences in the amplitude of NDVI were quite distinct for evergreen forests compared to deciduous ones and mixed deciduous forests. Although, all the evergreen forests studied had a similar growing season length of 270 days, the onset and offset dates were quite different. Response of vegetative greenness to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and forest types. Linear correlations between mean monthly NDVI and temperature were found to yield negative relationships in contrast to precipitation, which showed a significant positive response to vegetation greenness. The correlations improved much for different forest types when the log of cumulative rainfall was correlated against mean monthly NDVI. Of the eight forest types, the NDVI for six forest types was positively correlated with the logarithm of cumulative rainfall that was summed for 3\xe2\x80\x934 months. Overall, this study identifies precipitation as a major control for vegetation greenness in tropical forests, more so than temperature.'

Abstract: 'Demand for new environmental services from forests requires improved monitoring of these services at three scales: project-, regional-, and national-level. Most forest management activities are organized at the project scale, while the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) recognizes the nation as the party to the agreement. Hence, measurement and monitoring issues are emerging at the intersections of the project and national scales, referred to here as monitoring-domain edge effects. The following actions are necessary to improve existing monitoring capabilities and to help resolve project/national edge effects: (1) consensus on standard methods and protocols for monitoring mitigation activities, their off-site greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts, the fate of forest products and their relation to national GHG inventories (baselines); (2) a global program for collecting land use, land cover, biomass burning, and other data essential for national baselines; (3) the development of new nested-monitoring-domain methods that allow projects to be identified in national GHG inventories (baselines), and permit tracking of leakage of GHGs and wood product flows outside project boundary and over time; and (4) presentation of a set of credible, carefully designed, and well-documented forest mitigation activities that resolve most of the current issues.'

Abstract: 'A set of 24 strains belonging to the genus Anabaena (Phylum Cyanobacteria), isolated from diverse geographic locations in India, were evaluated along with three International type strains of Anabaena (ATCC 29414, ATCC 29208 and ATCC 27899) for their morphological, physiological and biochemical diversity. The morphological dataset, consisting of 58 variants for 15 characters, and SDS-PAGE protein profiles comprising 17 polymorphic bands were utilized to differentiate the selected Anabaena strains and explore the patterns of diversity through cluster analysis. Physiological and biochemical characterization with respect to nitrogen fixation and accumulation of chlorophyll and phycobiliproteins led to the identification of some highly promising Anabaena strains for use as biofertilizers and source of pigments. The study highlighted the tremendous inter and intraspecific diversity within the Anabaena isolates and indicated the potential as well as constraints of the morphological and protein profiling datasets for unambiguous differentiation and analyses of diversity among the Anabaena strains.'

Abstract: 'This study reports a protocol for successful micropropagation of Decalepis arayalpathra (Joseph and Chandras) Venter. (Janakia arayalpathra Joseph and Chandrasekhran; Periplocaceae), a critically endangered and endemic ethnomedicinal plant in the southern forests of the Western Ghats which is overexploited for its tuberous medicinal roots by the local Kani tribes. Natural regeneration is rare and conventional propagation is difficult. Conservation of the species through micropropagation was attempted. The nodal explants of greenhouse-raised plants, were more desirable than cotyledonary nodal explants of aseptic seedlings. The basal nodes (73%) of 12\xe2\x80\x9316-wk-old greenhouse-grown plants cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 12.96 \xce\xbcM 6-benzyladenine (BA), 2.48 \xce\xbcM 2-isopentenyladenine (2-ip) and 2.68 \xce\xbcM \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) formed 16\xe2\x80\x9317 cm long unbranched robust solitary shoots in 8 wk. Cotyledonary nodal explants cultured in the same medium showed multiple shoot formation and axillary branching. But the shoots were thin, fragile and not suitable for mass propagation. Single nodes of a solitary shoot subcultured on MS medium containing 2.22 \xce\xbcM BA and 0.24 \xce\xbcM 2-ip together produced 9.8\xc2\xb10.3 nodes from 18.0\xc2\xb10.6 cm long shoots within 5\xe2\x80\x936 wk. The basal nodes of the shoots so formed were repeatedly subcultured to increase the stock of propagules while the 2.5\xe2\x80\x933.0 cm terminal cuttings were used for rooting. The best root induction (68%) and survival (86%) was achieved on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 1.07 \xce\xbcM NAA. Field-established plants showed uniform growth and phenotypic similarity to parental stock.'

Abstract: 'To ensure replenishment, a refine protocol for micropropagation of Decalepis salicifolia (Bedd. ex Hook.f.) Venter a critically endangered and endemic medicinal plant was developed using mature nodal explants. A high frequency shoot regeneration system was obtained on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium comprised of 6- benzyladenine (BA) (5.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) (0.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89adenine sulphate (ADS) (30.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) corresponds to a highest mean number of 9.97\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.01 shoots/explants with maximum shoot length of 6.46\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.1\xc2\xa0cm. Successful rooting in microshoots was achieved on half strength MS medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (2.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M). A maximum of 6.10\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.07 roots/microshoot with average root length of 2.30\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.06\xc2\xa0cm was obtained. As much as 90% plantlets survived when Soilrite\xe2\x84\xa2 was used as planting substrate and finally established in soil without any casualty and morphological variation. Acclimatized plantlets were screened for pigment content, net photosynthetic rate (PN), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (E) during subsequent days of acclimatization as well as the changes in antioxidant was also evaluated. A steady rise was observed in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) for initial 21\xc2\xa0days and then after a decrease was found showing improved acclimatization efficiency of the plant. Similarly, the activities of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzyme shows reliable increase as the days of acclimatization advanced which play their precautionary role against oxidative damage to the plant. The genetic fidelity of the in vitro raised plantlets with that of mother plant was further confirmed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inters simple sequence repeats (ISSR) analysis. Additionally, the effect of acclimatization on the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (2H4MB) in the root system was also evaluated in relation to their biomass production. Maximum fresh weight (4.9\xc2\xa0g/plant), dry weight (0.65\xc2\xa0g/plant) of roots and 2H4MB content (6.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g\xc2\xa0ml\xe2\x88\x921 of root extract) was obtained after 10\xc2\xa0weeks of acclimatization. Accelerated multiplication rate with the stability of genetic virtue, physiological and biochemical parameter assure the efficacy of the protocol developed for the propagation of this critically endangered medicinal plant.'

Abstract: ' Knema andamanica is a red-listed endemic medicinal species of Myristicaceae restricted to Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands, India. This species is used in tribal medicines and has immense bioprospective potential. With a view to generate suitable genomic markers for classification and identification, we have generated RAPD, SCAR and conserved 18S rDNA markers from K. andamanica. A unique 585\xc2\xa0bp fragment, that distinguished it from seven other related species of Myristicaceae was first amplified using the random primer OPE 06 and converted to SCAR marker (GenBank accession # JN228256). The conserved sequences of 18S rDNA loci from K. andamanica were also amplified and sequenced (GenBank accession #JN228265). The sequence revealed deviations including 18 variable regions and 15 indels that were unique to K. andamanica. These markers can help in definite identification of K. andamanica even at the juvenile stages.'

Abstract: 'Recent research point to the Indian wild taxa of Cucumis callosus (Rottler) Cogn. as the wild progenitor of melon (C. melo L.). Overlapping distribution with cultivated and weedy and feral forms of melo and normal fertility of F1 and BC1 generations of its cross with cultivated melon indicate its progenitor status. A perusal of herbarium data indicate its natural distribution pattern in the region comprising Vindhya Hills and Aravalli mountain ranges extending northwards to Indo-Gangetic plains and southwards to the Deccan plateau touching rain shadow areas of Western Ghats. Characterised by drought tolerance and field resistance to a host of pests and diseases, it is conspicuously absent in the high rainfall areas of Western Ghats and upper Himalayan region. Based on its morphological distinction and F1 and BC1 fertility with C. melo, a subspecific rank within C. melo is postulated. First-hand information on its occurrence, distribution and crossability relationship with other Indian taxa of Cucumis are given.'

Abstract: 'In recent years considerable attention has been paid to the notion of \xe2\x80\x98market creation\xe2\x80\x99 for the conservation of environmental assets. Market creation establishes a market in the external benefit or cost in question (e.g. biodiversity or pollution reduction) and leaves the relevant parties to adjust their behaviour accordingly. While most attention has been paid to market creation through tradable permits and taxes (the \xe2\x80\x98polluter-pays\xe2\x80\x99), it is less easy to secure a perspective on \xe2\x80\x98beneficiary-pays\xe2\x80\x99 initiatives. Both polluter-pays and beneficiary-pays initiatives are examples of modified Coaseian bargains in which governments intervene in the bargains to lower transactions costs, establish property rights, deal with public goods issues, or act on behalf of disadvantaged groups. This paper reviews four major initiatives in this respect - debt-for-nature swaps, bioprospecting and the Global Environment Facility at the global level, and the Costa Rican Forest Law at the local level. It finds that while there is much to applaud in initiatives in these new markets, serious questions remain about the modest flows of funds associated with such \xe2\x80\x98global bargains\xe2\x80\x99, and the extent to which they secure environmental improvements relative to the baseline of business-as-usual.'

Abstract: 'Identifying the factors that contribute to species distribution will help determine the impact of the changing climate on species\xe2\x80\x99 range contraction and expansion. Ecological niche modelling is used to analyze the present and potential future distribution of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) in two biogeographically distinct regions of India i.e., the Western Ghats (WG) and Northeast (NE). The rubber tree is an economically important plantation species, and therefore factors other than climate may play a significant role in determining its occurrence. To assist in future planning, we used the maximum entropy model to predict plausible areas for the expansion of rubber tree plantations under a changing climate scenario. Inclusion of elevation, soil and socioeconomic factors into the model did not result in a significant increase in the model accuracy estimates over the bioclimatic model (AUC\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.92), but their effect was pronounced in the predicted probability scoring of species occurrence. Among various factors, elevation, rooting condition, village population and agricultural labour availability contributed substantially to the model in the NE region, whereas for the WG region, climate was the most important contributing factor for rubber tree distribution. We found that more areas would be suitable for rubber tree plantation in the NE region, whereas further expansion would be limited in the WG region under the projected climate scenario for 2050.'

Abstract: 'We present here the first use of DNA barcoding in a new approach to ethnobotany we coined "ethnobotany genomics". This new approach is founded on the concept of \'assemblage\' of biodiversity knowledge, which includes a coming together of different ways of knowing and valorizing species variation in a novel approach seeking to add value to both traditional knowledge (TK) and scientific knowledge (SK). We employed contemporary genomic technology, DNA barcoding, as an important tool for identifying cryptic species, which were already recognized ethnotaxa using the TK classification systems of local cultures in the Velliangiri Hills of India. This research is based on several case studies in our lab, which define an approach to that is poised to evolve quickly with the advent of new ideas and technology. Our results show that DNA barcoding validated several new cryptic plant species to science that were previously recognized by TK classifications of the Irulas and Malasars, and were lumped using SK classification. The contribution of the local aboriginal knowledge concerning plant diversity and utility in India is considerable; our study presents new ethnomedicine to science. Ethnobotany genomics can also be used to determine the distribution of rare species and their ecological requirements, including traditional ecological knowledge so that conservation strategies can be implemented. This is aligned with the Convention on Biological Diversity that was signed by over 150 nations, and thus the world\'s complex array of human-natural-technological relationships has effectively been re-organized.'

Abstract: 'The Nilwala Ganga Basin of Sri Lanka includes important natural wetlands that are habitat for vulnerable animal and plant species. Flood protection and intensive rice production in the Basin have resulted in degraded acid soils and declining rice yields. However, traditional \xe2\x80\x98maavee\xe2\x80\x99 rice production outside the flood protection scheme has continued to generate a high-value rice product. This study reports on interviews conducted with farmers and other stakeholders to document the production practices and the potential environmental and economic benefits associated with maavee rice paddies. The maavee production system has prevailed for at least several decades. Farmers apply no chemicals to their paddies, relying instead on alluvial deposits as a source of nutrients, and on the natural pest and disease resistance of their traditional varieties. The maavee rice product can attain three times the selling price of rice from conventional farms making it more economically viable than conventional rice production. However, much of maavee production is for home consumption and the system is threatened by increasing labour costs, an ageing farming population and pressures to increase rice yields. Non-invasive production practices and the proximity of maavee paddies to regenerating wetlands in the Kirala Kele Sanctuary suggest that traditional paddies may constitute an important habitat for vulnerable wildlife; however, maavee farmers also perceive wetland birds as potentially damaging to rice. Based on a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis, we make recommendations for future research needs and potential management actions to safeguard the environmental and economic sustainability of the maavee system.'

Abstract: 'Analyzing the spatial extent and distribution of forest fires is essential for sustainable forest resource management. There is no comprehensive data existing on forest fires on a regular basis in Biosphere Reserves of India. The present work have been carried out to locate and estimate the spatial extent of forest burnt areas using Resourcesat-1 data and fire frequency covering decadal fire events (2004\xe2\x80\x932013) in Similipal Biosphere Reserve. The anomalous quantity of forest burnt area was recorded during 2009 as 1,014.7\xc2\xa0km2. There was inconsistency in the fire susceptibility across the different vegetation types. The spatial analysis of burnt area shows that an area of 34.2\xc2\xa0% of dry deciduous forests, followed by tree savannah, shrub savannah, and grasslands affected by fires in 2013. The analysis based on decadal time scale satellite data reveals that an area of 2,175.9\xc2\xa0km2 (59.6\xc2\xa0% of total vegetation cover) has been affected by varied rate of frequency of forest fires. Fire density pattern indicates low count of burnt area patches in 2013 estimated at 1,017 and high count at 1,916 in 2004. An estimate of fire risk area over a decade identifies 12.2\xc2\xa0km2 is experiencing an annual fire damage. Summing the fire frequency data across the grids (each 1\xc2\xa0km2) indicates 1,211 (26\xc2\xa0%) grids are having very high disturbance regimes due to repeated fires in all the 10 years, followed by 711 grids in 9 years and 418 in 8 years and 382 in 7 years. The spatial database offers excellent opportunities to understand the ecological impact of fires on biodiversity and is helpful in formulating conservation action plans.'

Abstract: 'The Western Himalayan region of India possesses rich genetic diversity of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rice landraces having withstood the rigors of biotic and abiotic stresses, suit to the local conditions of farms and reflect socio-cultural preferences can still be found in crop fields located distantly in rural and tribal areas. This region is known for growing World fame basmati in the foot hills and many varieties of red rices grown at higher elevations, known for cold tolerance and medicinal properties. Genetic resources of rice were collected for about 8\xc2\xa0years (1999\xe2\x80\x932006) and 1069 germplasm accessions including 154 named landraces were collected. Prominent landraces such as Begumi, Ramjwain, Thapachini, Naurang, Hansraj, Tilakchandan, Lalsati, Jhini, Mushakbudji, Jattoo, Barpasso, Qadirbeigh, Safedbrez, Shahie known for their special quality attributes were collected. The change in land use, cropping patterns and aggressive introduction of modern varieties in the region has resulted in the loss of a large number of landraces especially from irrigated lands. The present paper looks at the status of rice genetic resources, genetic variability, genetic erosion and future strategies to conserve rice germplasm on farm and to maximize its use in rice breeding.'

Abstract: 'Rapid micropropagation of Trichopus zeylanicus Gaertn. subsp. travancoricus Burkil ex Narayanan, a rare ethnomedicinal herb endemic to the Western Ghats of southern India, was achieved by culturing shoot tips (0.3\xe2\x80\x930.5 cm) of 2-month-old axenic seedlings on Woody Plant Medium. Among the cytokinins tested, only BAP induced callus-free multiple shoot bud formation, with a maximum of 8.5\xc2\xb10.4 buds per explant being obtained with 2.0 mg.l\xe2\x88\x921 BAP after 8 weeks of culture. Shoot tips containing proliferated buds were divided and subcultured on medium containing 0.2 mg.l\xe2\x88\x921 BAP to produce 12.0\xc2\xb11.0 shoots per explant in 6 weeks. Excision of buds after culture initiation, with subculture of the debudded basal tissue in 2 successive passages yielded 20.0\xc2\xb11.0 and 13.5\xc2\xb10.5 buds per explant respectively. Each bud cultured in turn for 4 weeks on WPM with 1.0 mg.l\xe2\x88\x921 BAP formed 3.8\xc2\xb10.4 secondary buds which were repeatedly recultured to increase bud production. Altogether this method enabled an estimated harvest of 7848 buds from a single shoot tip in 28 months. Shoots (3\xe2\x80\x935 cm) developed from bud cultures were rooted in half-strength WPM medium with 0.5 mg.l\xe2\x88\x921 each of NAA and IBA, and 90\xe2\x80\x93100% of the rooted plants were established in the field after hardening. Micropropagated plants were grown to maturity free of defects in growth, morphological, flowering and seed set characteristics.'

Abstract: 'Plectranthus bishopianus has recently been treated as a synonym of Plectranthus deccanicus. However, a detailed study of the type materials, recently collected specimens, as well as SEM analysis of pollen and mericarp of both species suggests that P. bishopianus is a distinct species. The specific status of P. bishopianus is thus reinstated, and it can be easily distinguished from P. deccanicus by the stem nature, leaf size and shape, cyme length, number of flowers per cyme, the structure of flowering and fruiting calyx and mericarp surface. Additionally, complete taxonomic descriptions, photographs and conservation assessments, along with notes on distribution and habitat of both species, are provided.'

Abstract: 'Reproductive output and fertility variation in teak were evaluated in five study sites in Western Ghats region of southern India. In four seed production areas (SPA1-4)) and a natural population (NAT) plots with 100 trees were investigated. The 40-year-old seed production areas are located in high rainfall (>2,500\xc2\xa0mm) sites in Kerala state and the natural stand is at a drier location in Tamil Nadu. Fruit production per tree was rather high in the natural stand (1500) and quite variable in the seed production areas. SPA 4, located far south from the other sites, had the highest fruit production (almost twice that in the other study sites), high relative population size (N  r \xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.5) and predicted low genetic drift in two consecutive years. Fecundity was very low in SPAs 2 & 3 (200 fruits per tree). Reproductive output was similar in successive years except SPA 1, where the fruit production in the first year was almost five times that in the second year. Fertility variation (computed as sibling coefficient, \xce\xa8) was in general higher in NAT and hence the relative population size was lower than in SPAs. The variation in female fertility in the natural stand was, somewhat surprisingly, similar to that in the seed production areas, while the male fertility variation was higher. In the seed production areas the male fertility variation was lower or similar to the female fertility variation. The fertility variation, \xce\xa8 was on average around 3 and correspondingly the relative effective population size, N  r \xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.36 and the variance effective number around 60. Selection for tree diameter would improve predicted diversity of the seed crop as it was positively correlated with reproductive output and negatively correlated with fertility variation among trees.'

Title: 'Taxonomic Implications of a Field Study of Morphotypes of Hanuman Langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) in Peninsular India'

Abstract: 'The Hanuman langur is one of the most widely distributed and morphologically variable non-human primates in South Asia. Even though it has been extensively studied, the taxonomic status of this species remains unresolved due to incongruence between various classification schemes. This incongruence, we believe, is largely due to the use of plastic morphological characters such as coat color in classification. Additionally these classification schemes were largely based on reanalysis of the same set of museum specimens. To bring greater resolution in Hanuman langur taxonomy we undertook a field survey to study variation in external morphological characters among Hanuman langurs. The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the number of morphologically recognizable units (morphotypes) of Hanuman langur in peninsular India and to compare our field observations with published classification schemes. We typed five color-independent characters for multiple adults from various populations in South India. We used the presence-absence matrix of these characters to derive the pair-wise distance between individuals and used this to construct a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree. The resulting NJ tree retrieved six distinct clusters, which we assigned to different morphotypes. These morphotypes can be identified in the field by using a combination of five diagnostic characters. We determined the approximate distributions of these morphotypes by plotting the sampling locations of each morphotype on a map using GIS software. Our field observations are largely concordant with some of the earliest classification schemes, but are incongruent with recent classification schemes. Based on these results we recommend Hill (Ceylon Journal of Science, Colombo 21:277-305, 1939) and Pocock (Primates and carnivora (in part) (pp. 97\xe2\x80\x93163). London: Taylor and Francis, 1939) classification schemes for future studies on Hanuman langurs.'

Abstract: 'In this study we analyzed climate and crop yields data from Indian cardamom hills for the period 1978\xe2\x80\x932007 to investigate whether there were significant changes in weather elements, and if such changes have had significant impact on the production of spices and plantation crops. Spatial and temporal variations in air temperatures (maximum and minimum), rainfall and relative humidity are evident across stations. The mean air temperature increased significantly during the last 30\xc2\xa0years; the greatest increase and the largest significant upward trend was observed in the daily temperature. The highest increase in minimum temperature was registered for June (0.37\xc2\xb0C/18\xc2\xa0years) at the Myladumpara station. December and January showed greater warming across the stations. Rainfall during the main monsoon months (June\xe2\x80\x93September) showed a downward trend. Relative humidity showed increasing and decreasing trends, respectively, at the cardamom and tea growing tracts. The warming trend coupled with frequent wet and dry spells during the summer is likely to have a favorable effect on insect pests and disease causing organisms thereby pesticide consumption can go up both during excess rainfall and drought years. The incidence of many minor pest insects and disease pathogens has increased in the recent years of our study along with warming. Significant and slight increases in the yield of small cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum M.) and coffee (Coffea arabica), respectively, were noticed in the recent years.; however the improvement of yield in tea (Thea sinensis) and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) has not been seen in our analysis.'

Title: 'Discrimination between Oryza malampuzhaensis Krish. et Chand. and Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt based on RAPD markers and morphological traits'

Abstract: ' Oryza malampuzhaensis, one of the tetraploid taxa of the genusOryza, is geographically restricted to Western Ghats of South India. Its taxonomic status is not well established and is generally treated as a tetraploid race of O. officinalis. Sixty-three morphological traits and 262 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers generated by 23 random decamer primers were used to assess the genetic relationship between O. malampuzhaensis and O. officinalis. Pair wise comparisons based on both RAPDs and morphological traits revealed 60% genetic distance between the two taxa and was significantly higher (p <0.01) than the corresponding intra-specific distances. Cluster and principal component analysis (PCA) of genetic distance estimations based on RAPDs and morphological traits clearly differentiated the two taxa. High frequency of discrete O. malampuzhaensis specific RAPDs (21%) and the significantly higher (p < 0.05) mean number of amplification products per individual in O. malampuzhaensis observed in the study reflect its allopolyploid nature. Low genetic diversity within O. malampuzhaensis revealed by RAPD analysis indicates the recent origin of this taxa. The RAPD analysis further revealed the possibility that the putative \xe2\x80\x98C\xe2\x80\x99 genomeprogenitor of O. malampuzhaensis is a close relative of O. officinalis. In addition, amplification products diagnostic to O. malampuzhaensis were identified. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that the O. malampuzhaensis is a distinct entity, and support the recent conclusion that O. malampuzhaensis has diverged enough to deserve species status.'

Abstract: 'The spatial changes in forest cover of Similipal biosphere reserve, Odisha, India over eight decades (1930\xe2\x80\x932012) has been quantified by using multi-temporal data from different sources. Over the period, the forest cover reduced by 970.8 km2 (23.6% of the total forest), and most significantly during the period, 1930\xe2\x80\x931975. Human-induced activities like conversion of forest land for agriculture, construction of dams and mining activities have been identified as major drivers of deforestation. Spatial analysis indicates that 399 grids (1 grid = 1 \xc3\x97 1 km) have undergone large-scale changes in forest cover (>75 ha) during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975, while only 3 grids have shown >75 ha loss during 1975\xe2\x80\x931990. Annual net rate of deforestation was 0.58 during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975, which has been reduced substantially during 1975\xe2\x80\x931990 (0.04). Annual gross rate of deforestation in 2006\xe2\x80\x932012 is indeed low (0.01) as compared to the national and global average. This study highlights the impact and effectiveness of conservation practices in minimizing the rate of deforestation and protecting the Similipal Biosphere Reserve.'

Abstract: 'In the coastal littoral forest of extreme southeastern Madagascar, westudied tree diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa5 10 cm in 20, 50\xc3\x97 50 m plots in each of four forest fragments, andunderstorywoody vegetation (DBH < 10 cm, \xe2\x89\xa51 m tall) in60,10 \xc3\x97 10 m plots in three of the fragments. Oneforestfragment was located in the highly degraded Lokaro region, and three in the nearbySainte-Luce forest. Atotal of 3476 trees, representing 169 species in 55 families, were recorded inthe50 \xc3\x97 50 m plots, and 10282 understory stems, representing195 species in 54 families, were found in the 10 \xc3\x97 10m plots. For each tree, DBH was recorded. Mean tree diameter andpatterns of tree size class distribution did not differ among the four forestfragments. However, the fragments differed significantly in both tree andunderstory stem densities, species richness and diversity values, and familyrichness values, with the Lokaro fragment having the lowest values for allmeasures. Furthermore, floristic patterns, family importance values, and communitysimilarity measures revealed that the species composition at theLokaro fragment was very different from the Sainte-Luce fragments. Anthropogenicdisturbance appears most pronounced in the isolated Lokaro forest, where bioticresources are limited to this single fragment.'

Abstract: 'The wild species in general is considered to be the reservoir of genes especially for biotic and abiotic stresses. In okra, the predominant biotic stresses are yellow vein mosaic disease (YVMD), shoot and fruit borer and leaf hopper. Sixty eight (68) accessions belonging to four wild Abelmoschus species [Abelmoschus caillei (A. Chev.) Stevels, Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik., Abelmoschus moschatus (L.) Medik. and Abelmoschus tuberculatus Pal et Singh] and eight okra varieties were characterized and evaluated for phenological characters including biotic stresses under natural epiphytotic condition. The wild species examined consisted of 18 accessions (16 exotic and 2 indigenous) of A. caillei, 29 accessions of A. manihot, 16 accessions of A. moschatus and 5 accessions of A. tuberculatus. All the wild Abelmoschus species exhibited high diversity (as measured by Shannon Diversity Index) for 3 qualitative characters viz. intensity of stem colour, leaf shape, epicalyx shape, 13 quantitative characters and 3 biotic stress parameters. Among the wild species, A. caillei and A. tuberculatus showed maximum and minimum diversity for qualitative characters, respectively. There was significant variation for 19 out of 24 quantitative characters studied. Inter-species diversity pattern as estimated through Ward\xe2\x80\x99s Minimum Variance Dendrogram and Principal Component Analysis revealed clear differentiation among the species with minimum overlapping indicating close association between geographical origins and clustering pattern. Intra-species diversity indicated role of specific adaptation in sub-clustering. Resistance to YVMD was found in accessions belonging to three wild species viz. A. caillei, A. manihot and A. moschatus while resistance to shoot and fruit borer and leaf hopper was found in accessions of all the four wild species. The resistant accessions can further be used for introgressing biotic stress resistance through pre-breeding into cultivated okra species.'

Abstract: 'Small-fruited bitter gourds, the \xe2\x80\x9cpavel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpandi-pavel\xe2\x80\x9d described in Hortus Malabaricus, is nearly an extinct crop in Kerala and rest of southern peninsular India. They are reported to have been cultivated extensively in the past. However, presently its cultivation is restricted to a few home gardens in remote forest areas consequent on its replacement by large-fruited cultivars over the last two centuries. Special traits like unique flavour, taste, medicinal properties and fruit fly tolerance have enabled the perpetuation of this relict vegetable still in a few homesteads. Eleven named landraces have been collected from South Western Ghats and Tamil Nadu plains and their seeds conserved in the genebank of NBPGR, New Delhi. Known as \xe2\x80\x9cuchie\xe2\x80\x9d in Northern India and \xe2\x80\x9cmethipavai\xe2\x80\x9d in Tamil, these miniature bitter gourds have different landrace names in specific pockets of natural occurrence/cultivation.'

Abstract: ' The allozyme variation and population genetic structure of Horabagrus brachysoma in three natural populations from the southern part of the Western Ghats region, India, were investigated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Variations at 14 loci from 14 enzyme systems were analyzed. The allozyme analysis revealed a high level of genetic variation in this species, with an average of observed alleles per locus of 2.357 and observed heterozygosity of 0.178. The positive value of the fixation index (F IS\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.507) implied a significant deficiency of heterozygosity at the population level. The highly significant probability (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001) for the overall loci suggested that the three sample sets were not part of the same gene pool. '

Abstract: 'The present study investigates the hydrological response of increase in urbanization on water stressed Upper Bhima River basin which lies in a semi-arid climatic zone of Maharashtra state, India. Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes due to urbanization, industrialization and anthropogenic activities have reconfigured the waterscape of the river basin, which has affected its regional hydrology. Influence of urbanization on key hydrological components is studied using Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. Firstly, Object Based Image Analysis approach was used to prepare time series LULC maps of the years 1992, 2002, 2009 and 2014. Overall classification accuracy of 92.48% and Kappa Coefficient (K) of 0.87 were achieved. Urbanization indicators, e.g. population urbanization level (Up) and spatial urbanization level (Us), were used to quantify the growth patterns in population and urban areas respectively. Mann\xe2\x80\x93Kendall trend test was performed on the average annual rainfall data (year 1985\xe2\x80\x932014) to study rainfall trends across the region. Further, combination of statistical analyses including correlation analysis and multivariate analysis of variance were performed to comprehend the causative connection and interrelationships between Us and hydrological parameters. The results reveal that during 1992\xe2\x80\x932014, with increase in Us of 0.05, the average annual surface runoff increased to 10.4\xc2\xa0mm [standard deviation (\xcf\x83)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894.40; sum of squares (SS)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8958.20], whereas percolation decreased to 14.5\xc2\xa0mm [\xcf\x83\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x896.06; SS\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89110.10], and base flow decreased to 11.7\xc2\xa0mm (\xcf\x83\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894.90; SS\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8972.00). These hydrological parameters are highly influenced by increase in urbanization. This study is relevant for various stakeholders such as water sources planners and policy makers for assessment of water resources to ensure sustainable development in the urbanizing tropical river basins. Remedial measures are suggested to minimize the adverse effect of urbanization on hydrological processes.'

Abstract: 'The present study is focussed on development of a high-frequency micro-multiplication system in Calamus thwaitesii, through somatic embryogenesis from immature zygotic embryos cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 31.68\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The semi-friable calli when cultured in the same medium augmented with 2.22\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1.07\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) induced\xc2\xa0~\xc2\xa012 discrete globular embryoids in 6\xc2\xa0weeks. The isolated embryoids in hormone-free media yielded 65% plantlets. Furthermore, embryoids and axenic shoots exhibited maximum shoot induction in medium supplemented with 0.45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M Thidiazuron (TDZ). The shoot initials after subculture in media supplemented with 1.78\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M BAP and 0.45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M TDZ produced shoot proliferation followed by elongation in basal medium. The elongated shoots produced roots in media supplemented with 16.11\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M NAA. With this established protocol,\xc2\xa0~\xc2\xa05940 rooted plantlets could be harvested after 40\xc2\xa0weeks from a single embryoid. Genetic stability analysis of the plantlets using inter simple sequence repeat markers recorded only 0.05% genetic polymorphism. The plantlets were hardened in a mist house for 8\xc2\xa0weeks, and then to 50% shade house for another 16\xc2\xa0weeks, and the well-established 6-month-old nursery plants, reintroduced to selected forest segments, exhibited 86% field establishment even after 3\xc2\xa0years of observation. Thus, the mass multiplication system developed could be a breakthrough for large-scale multiplication of C. thwaitesii to ensure continuous supply of quality planting material to the cottage industry through the development of agroforestry systems. Furthermore, the in vitro culture system developed here can be replicated for research activities related to the long-term\xe2\x80\x93short-term conservation, micro-multiplication and sustainable utilization of rare, endangered, endemic, monopodial/single stemmed rattan palms.'

Abstract: 'The existing sectional classification of the genus Crotalaria has merged the Indian sections Calycinae and Crotalaria under the section Calycinae Wight & Arn. emend. M.M.Le Roux & B.-E.van Wyk. Crotalaria subsection Bracteatae is re-evaluated to ascertain its position in the Calycinae clade. Evidences from morphological and molecular sequence data (ITS and trnL-F regions) are used to assess the subsectional position of Bracteatae. Within the recognized 12 species in the subsection, the morphological characters currently used to distinguish these species, are insignificant and overlapping and do not merit diagnostic characters of the species. Examination of the types and vouchers at different herbaria and specimens collected during field trips enabled us for a new interpretation of the existing circumscription of the species. Further, pod anatomical and molecular sequence data were also used for the delimitation of the species. Based on the results of the above studies, a new circumscription has been formalized here and contains five recognized species in the Bracteatae clade, viz., C. berteroana DC., C. longipes Wight & Arn., C. paniculata Willd., C. pulchra DC. and C. pellita DC. of the section Calycinae emend. M.M.Le Roux &  B.-E.van Wyk. Crotalaria subsection Bracteatae appeared to be a well supported monophyletic group, but nested within the Calycinae clade. In order to maintain the monophyly of Crotalaria section Calycinae, Bracteatae is synonymized with the former.'

Apomictic seeds of G. indica were found to be morphogenetically most potential followed by G. cambogia. The explants of G. xanthochymus were highly recalcitrant towards in vitro conditions and failed to induce adventitious buds on any of the media tested. High frequency direct shoot bud differentiation was induced in aseptic seed cultures of G. indica and G. cambogia on MS medium supplemented with cytokinins (BAP, kinetin or TDZ). Amongst the three cytokinins tested, TDZ (0.1\xe2\x80\x930.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) was most effective for adventitious bud differentiation in both G. indica and G. cambogia, however, the proliferating buds failed to elongate. Substantial number of buds induced on BAP supplemented media elongated into shoots after subculture on elongation medium. Addition of NAA along with cytokinins in the induction medium enhanced callusing without improvement in bud induction response. The induced adventitious buds were elongated on MS basal medium containing 0.2% activated charcoal. Direct rooting was achieved in both G. indica and G. cambogia on auxin supplemented media with best response at 10\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM IBA concentration in both the species. The in vitro raised plantlets showed 90% survival in the field when transferred after hardening and acclimatization.'

Abstract: 'Mid-tropospheric cyclones are often observed on daily and monthly mean maps over southern Asia during the summer southwest monsson season. Although they are important activators of monsoon rains over certain regions, only a few observational studies are available, and even fewer theoretical and numerical studies have been performed. This article attempts to summarize the present observational knowledge about mid-tropospheric cyclones and reviews current ideas on the formation, maintenance and dissipation of these systems. A recent numerical simulation of a mid-tropospheric cyclone is described. In general, latent heat release plays the dominant role in the dynamics of the cyclone. Much is still to be learned about mid-tropospheric cyclones and several promising areas of future research are suggested.'

Abstract: 'New institutional economists have argued that there are many categories of institutions, including market and non-market institutions, which may prove economically efficient, specifically for public goods and common pool goods. The Government of India introduced a non-market community-based institution, known as Joint Forest Management (JFM), for forest management and protection in 1990. JFM is a sharing mechanism for forest planning and management based on sharing of rights and duties, control and decision-making authority over forestlands, between forest departments and local user groups. By 2001, 42 000 Village Forest Committees established under JFM were managing over 11.5 million ha forestland. These institutions have proved very useful, and have contributed to forest management as well as four aspects of sustainable human development (SHD) \xe2\x80\x93 ecological output, income generation, village infrastructure development, and community empowerment. In the long-term, community-based institutions will prove to be a foundation of SHD and participatory democracy.'

Abstract: 'India is a vast country in terms of natural resources and considered one of the mega- biodiversity countries in the world. The freshwater aquatic resources of the different river basins are unevenly distributed in space and time and the country is suffering from the increasing population and shortage of all kind of natural resources like water. To fulfill the water demand and mitigate flood and drought, Indian Government has been planning a huge scheme encompassing the Himalayas and most of India, by linking all major rivers through interlinking canals systems and building several dams. Though the concept of interlinking of rivers is novel and new in India, it had rather initiated long back in other countries of ancient civilization. This is considered as one of the options to remedy spatial mismatch in water availability and demand. To overcome those, National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has taken up massive project and nearly 30 links have been proposed to interlink the major rivers. The Government of India has approved the country\xe2\x80\x99s first river interlinking project on Ken\xe2\x80\x93Betwa and a MOU has been signed among the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and the Union Government. The feasibility report of most of the links have been completed and detailed project reports of Ken\xe2\x80\x93Betwa River link is expected to be finalized soon. Our study indicated presence of rich fish diversity and threatened fishes in river Betwa and improved aquatic environment in river Ken which makes it a high priority area in view of proposed interlinking. The current state of knowledge indicates that large dams, interbasin transfers and water withdrawal from rivers have many negative as well as positive impacts on freshwater aquatic ecosystem. As regards to the impact on fish and aquatic biodiversity, there could be positive as well as negative impacts. The present paper is aimed at explaining and synthesizing the long term plan and its implications, creating baseline database, requirement of appropriate technology, manpower and related issues especially with reference to riverine aquatic ecosystem and conservation of fish biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Regional study on the impact of variations in input rainfall over groundwater quality and its suitability for utilitarian purposes is essential for its extraction and management. Water chemistry from 456 observations wells for 2007\xe2\x80\x932011 period in hard rock Basaltic terrain of Upper Godavari basin is supported with 8 field samples\xc2\xa0(in 2014) in this analysis. Based on mean annual rainfall (MAR), four narrow climatic zones are identified in the basin, defined as \xe2\x80\x9chumid\xe2\x80\x9d (MAR\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa01600\xc2\xa0mm), \xe2\x80\x9csub-humid\xe2\x80\x9d (1600\xe2\x80\x931000\xc2\xa0mm), \xe2\x80\x9csemi-arid\xe2\x80\x9d (1000\xe2\x80\x93600\xc2\xa0mm), and \xe2\x80\x9carid\xe2\x80\x9d (MAR\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0600\xc2\xa0mm). NICB ratio (<\xc2\xb110%), and anionic percentages demarcated\xc2\xa0the polluted areas from\xc2\xa0rest \xe2\x80\x9cgood data\xe2\x80\x9d, composing of 1818 samples. Hydrochemical facies are studied using Piper diagram, secondary alkalinity exceeded 50% and not one cation\xe2\x80\x93anion pair exceeded 50%, and silicate\xe2\x80\x93carbonate plot, arid zone nearer to silicate pole indicated the dominance of SiO2 in Ca/Na vs Mg/Na plot. These geochemical variations emphasize a detailed study on role of climatic gradient on groundwater suitability for different purposes, for groundwater extraction, and its management. Suitability of groundwater for drinking based on water quality indices (WQI) indicated 98% of the samples as suitable (WQI\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa050%). TDS in humid zone is 150\xe2\x80\x93500 and 500\xe2\x80\x931000\xc2\xa0mg/L in rest of the zones with \xe2\x88\xbc68% in permissible range, 15% as hard water (TDS\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa0600\xc2\xa0mg/L) and not acceptable for drinking. Suitability of groundwater for irrigation is studied using sodium percentage (Na %), Wilcox diagram, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), US salinity diagram, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s ratio (KR), ancd magnesium absorption ratio (MgAR). Na % in four zones is <\xc2\xa060% and permissible for irrigation. Very few water samples fall in \xe2\x80\x9cdoubtful to unsuitable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunsuitable\xe2\x80\x9d category of Wilcox diagram. Region is observed to have SAR\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa06, indicating that water would not cause any problem to the soil and crop. Humid and sub-humid zones belonged to C1S1 and C2S1 categories (low and medium sodium), while semi-arid extended to C3S1 category (salinity hazard zone) in US salinity plot. RSC for all the three zones ranged from 1 to 1.5\xc2\xa0meq/L, with 90\xe2\x80\x9395% of the area safe for irrigation. Out of 1818 samples, 1129 belonged to class 2 of PI classification (PI ranging from 25 to 75%) while rest 689 samples had PI >75% (class 1). KR varied from 0.05 to 12.81, with 70\xe2\x80\x9380% of the area having KR\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa01. MgAR ratio ranged from 67% to 96%, with sub-humid, humid zones having higher Mg concentrations (increased salinity). Thus, 90% of the samples indicated non-alkaline water with 1% of normal alkalinity. Hence, the current study systematically analyzed the effect of precipitation and geology on groundwater quality and on its usability for various purposes. This stepwise procedure categorized the regions, and the same can be adopted for any regional hydrogeochemical studies.'

Abstract: 'This review is intended to contribute to the understanding of the interlinkage between wildfire in India\xe2\x80\x99s tropical dry forest (TDF) and selected ecosystem services (ES), namely forest provisioning and water regulating services, as well as biodiversity. TDF covers approximately 146,000\xc2\xa0km2 (4.4\xc2\xa0%) of India, whereas according to the MODIS fire product\xc2\xa0about 2200\xc2\xa0km2 (1.4\xc2\xa0%) burns per year. As studies on wildfire effects upon ESs and biodiversity in Indian TDFs are rare we partly transferred findings from other (dry) forest areas to the environmental situation in India. In India (intentionally lit) wildfires have a very important connection to local livelihoods and the availability of non-wood forest products. Very important adverse long-term effects are the deterioration of forest ecosystems and soil degradation. The potential for TDF to regulate hydrological cycles is expected to be greater in the absence of fire than with it. A general judgment on the effect of fire on biodiversity is difficult as it depends on the community and species involved but a loss of biodiversity under regular burnings is apparent. Consequently, forest managers need sound knowledge regarding the interplay of wildfires and ecosystem behavior in general and more specific knowledge regarding the effects on taxa being considered for conservation efforts. Generally, much more research is needed to understand the trade-offs between the short-term benefits gained from forest provisioning services and long-term adverse effects.'

Abstract: 'Although Small Hydropower Projects (SHPs) are encouraged as sources of clean and green energy, there is a paucity of research examining their socio-ecological impacts. We assessed the perceived socio-ecological impacts of 4 SHPs within the Western Ghats in India by conducting semi-structured interviews with local respondents. Primary interview data were sequentially validated with secondary data, and respondent perceptions were subsequently compared against the expected baseline of assured impacts. We evaluated the level of awareness about SHPs, their perceived socio-economic impacts, influence on resource access and impacts on human\xe2\x80\x93elephant interactions. The general level of awareness about SHPs was low, and assurances of local electricity and employment generation remained largely unfulfilled. Additionally most respondents faced numerous unanticipated adverse impacts. We found a strong relationship between SHP construction and increasing levels of human\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflict. Based on the disparity between assured and actual social impacts, we suggest that policies regarding SHPs be suitably revised.'

Abstract: 'A survey was conducted to study the biological and genetic diversity ofCardamom mosaic virus (CdMV) that causes the most widespread disease in the cardamom growing area in the Western Ghats of south India. Six distinct subgroups were derived based on their symptomatology and host range from the sixty isolates collected. The serological variability between the virus isolates was analysed by ELISA and Western blotting. The 3\xe2\x80\xb2 terminal region consisting of the coat protein (CP) coding sequence and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 untranslated region (3\xe2\x80\xb2UTR) was cloned and sequenced from seven isolates. Sequence comparisons revealed considerable genetic diversity among the isolates in their CP and 3\xe2\x80\xb2UTR, making CdMV one of the highly variable members ofPotyviridae. The possible occurrence of recombination between the isolates and the movement of the virus in the cardamom tract of south India are discussed.'

Abstract: 'Rubia cordifolia L., is an industrially viable medicinal crop and is widely exploited for the therapeutic potential of its bioactive metabolite, purpurin. The present investigation aimed to explore the chemotypic and molecular variability in seven wild populations of R. cordifolia from South Eastern Ghats region of India. Thirty-eight individuals were assessed for molecular fingerprinting (ISSR markers) and densitometric quantification of purpurin and alizarin. The populations of Yelagiri Hills and Shervaroy Hills contained the highest levels of alizarin (0.115 and 0.093%, respectively) while Pachamalai and Kolli Hills revealed the highest purpurin content (0.284 and 0.280%, respectively). Genetic diversity was generally higher in the same populations that produced higher metabolite content, with the exception of Pachamalai, suggesting a highly prioritized conservation concern. The study revealed a Nei\xe2\x80\x99s total gene diversity at species level of 0.266 and of 0.187 at population level, with an average population genetic differentiation of 0.28. No clear genetic or chemical structure was retrieved between the studied populations, with individuals from different locations clustering together, and no significant correlation was obtained between metabolites and genetic diversity or between these and the populations\xe2\x80\x99 geographic distances.'

Abstract: 'A morphometric analysis of Bharathapuzha river basin has been carried out using geoprocessing techniques in GIS. This technique is found relevant for the extraction of river basin and its drainage networks. The extracted drainage network was classified according to Strahler\xe2\x80\x99s system of classification and it reveals that the terrain exhibits dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern. The Bharathapuzha drainage basin is sprawled over an area of 5,988.56\xc2\xa0km2. The study area was designated as seventh-order basin and lower order streams mostly dominate the basin with the drainage density value of 1.07\xc2\xa0km/km2. The slope of basin varied from 0\xc2\xb0 to 70\xc2\xb0 and the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. The elongation ratio of the basin is 0.57 indicating that the study area is elongated with moderate relief and steep slopes. The drainage texture of the basin is 7.78 which indicates an intermediate texture that exists over the region. Hence, from the study, it can be concluded that remote sensing data (SRTM\xe2\x80\x93DEM) coupled with geoprocessing techniques prove to be a competent tool in morphometric analysis and the data can be used for basin management and other hydrological studies in future.'

Title: 'Landscape Level Biodiversity Databases in India: Status and the Scope'

Abstract: 'Conservation of biodiversity requires management higher than the species level of organization, particularly at the landscape scale. It is, however, difficult to manage each threatened species individually. Alternatively, management can focus on the ecosystems that contain these species, and on the landscapes containing the ecosystems. The relatively new discipline of landscape ecology provides insight into both landscape diversity and the species diversity, and suggests a theoretical and practical basis for conservation planning. The information on the biodiversity characteristics such as species richness and their spatial distribution, economic, and the ethno-botanical importance is of great significance to any nation. The Department of Biotechnology and Department of Space, Government of India funded a nationwide project between 1998 and 2010 to characterize and map the flowering plants richness in the natural (forests, grasslands, scrub, etc.) and man-made (forest plantations) vegetation formations at landscape level. The spatial database on vegetation types generated using wet and dry season satellite imagery and ancillary data such as topographic maps and the species richness through field inventory were used to generate the spatially-explicit species distribution maps and statistics. A customized software package, SPLAM (Spatial Landscape Modeling) was developed for landscape analysis and spatial data integration. This, first of its kind unique study spanning over 12\xc2\xa0years, has resulted in a large baseline spatial database on vegetation types, porosity, patchiness, interspersion, juxtaposition, fragmentation, disturbance regimes, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and the species richness. The field inventory involved 16,581 geo-referenced 0.04\xc2\xa0ha plots across India and 7,761 plant species. The geospatially-tagged species database, created in the project, provides information on the endemic, rare, endangered, threatened, and medicinally/economically important species. The database, disseminated to large number of organizations including State Forest Departments, has found extensive applications in policy planning, operational management, biodiversity conservation, bio-prospecting, and the climate change studies.'

Title: 'DNA record of some traditional small millet landraces in India and Nepal'

Abstract: 'Despite the extensive use of small millet landraces as an important source of nutrition for people living in semi-arid regions, they are presently marginalized and their diversity and distribution are threatened at a global scale. Local farmers have developed ancient breeding programs entrenched in traditional knowledge (TK) that has sustained rural cultures for thousands of years. The convention on biological diversity seeks fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources arising from local knowledge and requires signatory nations to provide appropriate policy and legal framework to farmers\xe2\x80\x99 rights over plant genetic resources and associated TK. DNA barcoding employed in this study is proposed as a model for conservation of genetic diversity and an essential step towards documenting and protecting farmers\xe2\x80\x99 rights and TK. Our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural India and Nepal. Traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants. DNA was extracted and sequenced (rbcL, trnH-psbA and ITS2) from 160 samples. Both multivariate analysis of traits and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess diversity among small millet landraces. Our research revealed considerable variation in traits and DNA sequences among the 32 small millet landraces. We utilized a tiered approach using ITS2 DNA barcode to make 100\xc2\xa0% accurate landrace (32 landraces) and species (six species) assignments for all 160 blind samples in our study. We have also recorded precious TK of nutritional value, ecological and agricultural traits used by local farmers for each of these traditional landraces. This research demonstrates the potential of DNA barcoding as a reliable identification tool and for use in evaluating and conserving genetic diversity of small millets. We suggest ways in which DNA barcodes could be used in the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Rights in India and Nepal.'

Abstract: 'Density of tiger Panthera tigris and leopard Panthera pardus was estimated using photographic capture\xe2\x80\x93recapture sampling in a tropical deciduous forest of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, southern India, from November 2008 to February 2009. A total of 2,000 camera trap nights for 100\xc2\xa0days yielded 19 tigers and 29 leopards within an intensive sampling area of 107\xc2\xa0km2. Population size of tiger from closed population estimator model Mb Zippin was 19 tigers (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb10.9) and for leopards Mh Jackknife estimated 53 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb111) individuals. Spatially explicit maximum likelihood and Bayesian model estimates were 8.31 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb12.73) and 8.9 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb12.56) per 100\xc2\xa0km2 for tigers and 13.17 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb13.15) and 13.01 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb12.31) per 100\xc2\xa0km2 for leopards, respectively. Tiger density for MMDM models ranged from 6.07 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb11.74) to 9.72 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb12.94) per 100\xc2\xa0km2 and leopard density ranged from 13.41 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb12.67) to 28.91 (SE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb17.22) per 100\xc2\xa0km2. Spatially explicit models were more appropriate as they handle information at capture locations in a more specific manner than some generalizations assumed in the classical approach. Results revealed high density of tiger and leopard in Mudumalai which is unusual for other high density tiger areas. The tiger population in Mudumalai is a part of the largest population at present in India and a source for the surrounding Reserved Forest.'

Abstract: 'We describe the activity patterns and time budget of a feral group of lion-tailed macaques that were confined to a disturbed forest fragment of 65 ha and compare the results with those obtained for groups in protected forests. The degraded nature of the study site was reflected in low tree densities, low specific diversity, gaps in the girth distribution of trees, and frequent disturbance by humans. The study group of 43 subjects was twice as large as lion-tailed macaque groups in protected habitats. They spent the most time ranging (34.0%), followed by foraging (23.7%), feeding (17.9%), resting (16.0%), and other activities such as social interactions (8.4%). Monthly variations are significant for all activity categories except ranging. Times spent resting and foraging are negatively correlated (r = \xe2\x88\x920.5) and show significant seasonal differences. Foraging time was highest from September to November, when key food sources such asCullenia andArtocarpus were absent or marginally available. The study group spent most time (40.4%) at canopy levels between 21 and 30 m. They spent more time each day ranging than resting or feeding and more time terrestrially compared with groups in protected forests. Large group size, poor habitat quality, and seasonal variation in food availability were the major variables affecting their time budget, and these variables accounted for differences from the time budgets of groups in protected forests.'

Abstract: 'We studied time budgeting of lion-tailed macaques in the Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu, India, with regard to seven activity categories. Groups spent >50% of their time feeding and foraging, \xe2\x89\x8833% of the time resting, and 15% moving. More energetic activities were spread uniformly through the day. Feeding had two annual peaks: one closely following the northeast monsoon and the other corresponding to the southwest monsoon. These also coincided with peaks of food availability and mating. Time saved in feeding was spent mostly on resting. Ranging showed a pattern contrary to that of time spent moving and was related more to weather than to food availability; it increased during cooler periods. The middle and upper stories of the canopy were used >93% of the time. The ground was used rarely. Time budgeting characteristics of the lion-tailed macaque are primarily frugiinsectivorous adaptations to a wet evergreen forest habitat.'

Abstract: 'Scarcity of groundwater necessitates the present study to evaluate groundwater potential and quality for designing suitable water management plans in the Bhatsa and Kalu river basins in the Thane district in the western Deccan volcanic province of India. A Geographical Information System platform is used to integrate and spatially analyse multiparametric data comprised of satellite, topographical, geological and hydrogeological information to generate several thematic maps, including groundwater potential zonation map. This study reveals that 70% of the area has medium to low groundwater potential, while only 10% has high potential. The static and dynamic groundwater potentials are estimated to be 10.7 and 4.8% of the annual rainfall. The groundwater quality in terms of hardness, total dissolved solids, salinity and chloride is suitable for domestic and irrigational purposes. A database is developed for sustainable water management program for the region and areas where suitable water conservation techniques need to be adopted are identified.'

Abstract: 'An understanding of species ecology is vital for effective conservation, particularly if the species forms an important constituent of the lesser mammal guild and regulates small mammal and bird populations. As the ecological role of the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) in the intricate eastern Himalayan habitats is not known, we assessed the site occupancy, detection probability and activity pattern of leopard cats in Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, India, based on sign surveys and camera trapping. The estimated site occupancy was 0.352\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.061 and detection probability was 0.143\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.0484. Occupancy modelling indicated low elevation, high rodent abundance and tree cover as best predictors for the occupancy of leopard cat. Diet based on analysed scats revealed murids as the most dominant prey (89.2\xc2\xa0%). Information based on photographic captures indicated that the leopard cat exhibited a nocturnal activity pattern (peak activity between 0200\xe2\x80\x930300\xc2\xa0hours), which coincided with its principal prey (revealed through diet analysis), but mainly contradicted with other sympatric competitors, hence indicating a temporal partitioning of resources among them. Ecological niche factor analysis indicated that the leopard cat exhibits high global marginality (1.32) and low global tolerance (0.275). The habitat suitability map for leopard cats showed majority of the habitat as unsuitable (1,959.44\xc2\xa0km2) and predicted only 164.54\xc2\xa0km2 areas of lower temperate forests as moderate to highly suitable. As highly suitable habitats of the leopard cat are in close proximity to villages, conflict issues are a major threat and therefore need to be addressed in conservation program for this felid.'

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00384439
Abstract: 'Twenty-four species of sedges (representing six genera) from different vegetation types in Western Ghats, South India, were examined for vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) associations. All the sedges had VAM fungal infections with hyphae and vesicles, but arbuscules were observed only in 42% of the total species. The VAM fungal colonization varied considerably between species, ranging from 9 to 62%. Root colonization was positively and negatively correlated with root diameter and root hair length, respectively. The number of VAM fungal spores in the rhizosphere varied from 5 to 86 g-1 soil. No significant relationship was found between spore numbers or root colonization and either soil pH or moisture. Four Glomus spp., one Acaulospora sp., one Sclerocystis spp., and one Gigaspora sp. were identified among the VAM fungal spores. The results reflect a high incidence of VAM in sedges occurring in Western Ghats and emphasize the need to assess the VAM status of plant species from different ecosystems to understand their mycorrhizal status.'

Abstract: 'A combination of vertical electrical sounding (VES) and \xce\xb4O18 and \xce\xb4H2 stable isotope geochemistry is used in this study to trace out the extension of a dyke and for deciphering the subsurface piping phenomena in a landslide-affected hamlet, Pasukadavu, in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India. VES was successful in extracting three to four different subsurface layers characterized by differing resistivity. Two VES sections were prepared from 24 different VES locations, each one for understanding the dyke extension and for delineating subsurface conduits. The dyke was characterized by high resistivity of 800\xe2\x80\x935000\xc2\xa0\xce\xa9.m and shows varying thickness. In the second profile, the void zone, which is characteristic of piping, is delineated through a low resistivity zone (75 to 350\xc2\xa0\xce\xa9.m). \xce\xb4O18 and \xce\xb4H2 stable isotopes collected along the second VES profile show the same chemistry, indicating that it is the same water which flows all along the VES profile 2. A four-stage conceptual model was developed to illustrate and narrate the sequence of development of the piping phenomena and landslide activity.'

Abstract: 'The effects of short-term exposure (28 days) of free-feeding Limnonectus limnocharis (Indian cricket frog) tadpoles to field concentrations of malathion were investigated. This frog species is a major biotic component of the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats (13\xc2\xb018\xe2\x80\xb2, 75\xc2\xb025\xe2\x80\xb2 and 13\xc2\xb022\xe2\x80\xb2, 75\xc2\xb028\xe2\x80\xb2), where malathion (diethyl [(dimethoxy phosphino thioyl] butanediote), an organophosphate pesticide, is being used extensively. Although malathion is known to cause nonreversible acetylcholine inhibition and diminishes activity, growth and development in amphibian tadpoles, such data on Indian amphibian species are lacking. In the present study, increments in the following were used to assess such an impact: tadpole growth; increase in total length, body length, tail length, and body weight; and food consumption. The different concentrations of malathion employed were 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 \xce\xbcg L\xe2\x80\x931. Malathion exposure produced significant effects on all measured parameters. Tadpole survival decreased from 20 to 6 tadpoles, with an increase in concentration followed by a decrease in growth. Food consumption of surviving tadpoles also decreased (0.067 mg.g\xe2\x80\x931.d\xe2\x80\x931 to 0.0075 mg.g\xe2\x80\x931.d\xe2\x80\x931) with increased malathion. Decreased food consumption, growth, and development of L. limnocharis tadpoles with an increase of malathion concentration (within field concentration range) over temporal scale reveal the possible threat to this species in the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats.'

Abstract: 'Present study deals with the vegetation type mapping, structure and composition analysis of the tropical forests, spread over 1,294 km2 area in South Andaman Islands. Seventeen vegetation classes spreading over 89.92% forested area of the islands were mapped with the overall accuracy of 88.89%. Evergreen, semi-evergreen and mangrove forests were reasonably well distributed forests, while moist deciduous and littoral evergreen were narrowly restricted. The stocking was quite variable across the forest types. 60.04% of forested area was under medium to high canopy density. Secondary and degraded forest types were mapped. Information on floristic composition, structure and diversity of various forest types were obtained from 84 field sample plots. An inventory of 423 species of plants from 101 families included 155 trees, 84 shrubs, 150 herbs and 84 climbers. Tree density and mean basal area ranged from 517 to 900 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 36.15 to 53.58 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921 respectively. Evergreen forests accounted for highest diversity followed almost equally by semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests.'

Title: 'Hydro-meteorological and agricultural trends in water-scarce Karha Basin, western India: current and future scenario'

Abstract: 'The scientific understanding of hydro-meteorological and agricultural changes in the water-scarce region is crucial to formulate a plan for sustainable management of water resources and cropping pattern under the scenario of climate change. The present investigation, therefore, has attempted to detect the trends in the monsoon rainfall, runoff, dam storage, post-monsoon groundwater (PMGW) levels, and agricultural data in the Karha Basin, located in the rain shadow zone of the Western Ghat. Additionally, trends in projected monsoon rainfall and average annual temperature were also analyzed. The study indicates no significant increase in monsoon rainfall over the basin during past (1981\xe2\x80\x932013) and future (2015\xe2\x80\x932050). The noteworthy decline in monsoon runoff has mainly resulted due to the effective implementation of surface water harvesting in the basin, which has a significant positive change in PMGW table in the basin. The study also provides evidence of the shift in agricultural pattern, where the rainfed crops are getting replaced by the high water-requiring/cash crops. It may increase the future agricultural water demand and pressurize the limited water resources in the basin. On the other hand, significant increase in near-term future (up to 2050) temperature can augment the water demand along with the adverse impacts on the agricultural productivity. The Karha Basin is already suffering from water deficiency. The man-induced increase in agricultural water demand and the adverse climatic changes in the Karha Basin are very likely to aggravate the future drought conditions and further add to an already difficult water management challenge in the basin.'

Abstract: 'The paper presents a geospatial modeling approach for the assessment of biological richness in Kuldiha wildlife sanctuary in Orissa located in the northern tip of the Eastern Ghats in India. Indian Remote Sensing satellite data of Resourcesat-1 LISS III and field sampling were used to model biological richness at 1:50,000 scale. It was found that the sanctuary is dominated by Sal mixed dry deciduous forest. The vegetation map prepared through visual interpretation of satellite imagery was subjected to landscape analysis and assessment of biotic disturbance using SPLAM software. The disturbance index together with species richness, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and total importance value was modeled to access the biological richness in the sanctuary. A total of 3.9 per cent area was found to posses very high plant richness followed by high (21.2%), medium (42.1%) and low (32.8%) in the sanctuary. The study demonstrated the geospatial technology in conjunction with landscape analysis, ground inventory and geospatial modeling seizes good potential for rapid assessment of biological richness. The fringe areas of the sanctuary having disturbance more because most of the small villages which are relocated from sanctuary, settled in those areas.'

Abstract: 'The world\xe2\x80\x99s gastropod fauna from continental waters comprises \xe2\x88\xbc4,000 valid described species and a minimum of 33\xe2\x80\x9338 independent lineages of Recent Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia (including the Pulmonata). The caenogastropod component dominates in terms of species richness and diversity of morphology, physiology, life and reproductive modes and has produced several highly speciose endemic radiations. Ancient oligotrophic lakes (e.g., Baikal, Ohrid, Tanganyika) are key hotspots of gastropod diversity; also noteworthy are a number of lower river basins (e.g., Congo, Mekong, Mobile Bay). But unlike many other invertebrates, small streams, springs and groundwater systems have produced the most speciose associations of freshwater gastropods. Despite their ecological importance in many aquatic ecosystems, understanding of even their systematics is discouragingly incomplete. The world\xe2\x80\x99s freshwater gastropod fauna faces unprecedented threats from habitat loss and degradation and introduced fishes and other pests. Unsustainable use of ground water, landscape modification and stock damage are destroying many streams and springs in rural/pastoral areas, and pose the most significant threats to the large diversity of narrow range endemics in springs and ground water. Despite comprising only \xe2\x88\xbc5% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s gastropod fauna, freshwater gastropods account for \xe2\x88\xbc20% of recorded mollusc extinctions. However, the status of the great majority of taxa is unknown, a situation that is exacerbated by a lack of experts and critical baseline data relating to distribution, abundance, basic life history, physiology, morphology and diet. Thus, the already considerable magnitude of extinction and high levels of threat indicated by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is certainly a significant underestimate.'

Abstract: 'Tourism industry has become an important part of Indian economy, and tourism development has been, however, concentrated to a few areas. Accumulation of tourism activities has reached the critical stage in most of the tourism centers, which pose serious threats to the natural environment. The Bhyundar Valley of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in Uttarakhand State of the Indian Himalaya is a burning example of such problems. Land use/cover changes, deforestation and accumulation of garbage are some of the negative impacts of unregulated tourism in the valley. Unsustainable activities of tourists and villagers in the valley make such problems very severe. To deal with the ongoing problems and ensure community involvement in tourism management and environmental conservation, the Biosphere Reserve Authority introduced ecotourism in the form of Eco Development Committees (EDCs) in the Bhyundar Valley. Study reveals that many problems associated with tourism have been minimized to some extent with the help of EDCs but few are still prevailing in valley. However, the existing attempts to conserve the valley from the negative effects of tourism are inadequate and modifications are needed in the current initiatives.'

Abstract: 'An efficient protocol has been established for rapid multiplication of Ophiorrhiza mungos Linn. (Rubiaceae), a potent anticancer plant. Axillary and terminal buds of these in vitro-raised seedlings formed the primary source of explants for direct organogenesis. Explants were inoculated onto MS medium supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) and kinetin (KN). The best morphogenic response was observed on MS media supplemented with 0.25 mg L\xe2\x88\x921 BA and 0.25 mg L\xe2\x88\x921 KN, which exhibited the highest regeneration frequency (84%), the maximum number of shoots/explants (63.1 \xc2\xb1 1.35) and shoot length (2.8 \xc2\xb1 1.15) within 4 weeks. Fortification of 1.0 mg L\xe2\x88\x921 GA3 enhanced the shoot elongation by 2.33 fold in 91% of shoot cluster cultures within 3 weeks. A high percent frequency of rooting (92.13%) was achieved within 15 days of shoot implantation on \xc2\xbd strength MS media fortified with 100 mg L\xe2\x88\x921 activated charcoal. The rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized with 95% survival rate. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis confirmed that all the regenerated plants were genetically identical to their mother plant, suggesting an absence of detectable genetic variation in the regenerated plantlets. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was done to further confirm the existence of qualitative and quantitative differences in the major secondary metabolite (camptothecin) between the mother plant and in vitro-propagated plants. The present results evidently showed comparable chemical profiles. Thus, the present protocol can be used for clonal mass propagation of true-to-type elite O. mungos plants.'

Abstract: 'The Bandipur National Park situated in the Western Ghats of Karnataka State, is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. During recent years, this park has witnessed repeated fires, affecting considerable areas under vegetation. The temporal satellite data from 1997 to 2006 have been analyzed to map the burnt areas using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The vegetation cover is moist deciduous, dry deciduous, scrub forests and teak plantation. Information on extent of the burnt areas and the type of vegetation affected were derived forest range-wise. The fire prone regions have been identified by integrating vegetation type/density, road and settlement network and past history of forest fire occurrence, by assigning subjective weightage according to their fire-inducing capability or their sensitivity to fire. Comparison between each temporal dataset in terms of the extent of burnt area was also carried out to interpret fire incidence pattern. Three categories of fire risk regions such as Low, Moderate and High fire intensity zones were identified and it was found that almost 40% of the study area falls under low risk zone. An evaluation of the existing fire management systems and the implication of fire prevention programmes has been discussed, besides an assessment of causal factors for fire incidence in the park.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests play a crucial role as source and sink in global carbon cycle. Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India.'

Abstract: 'Wind power is expanding globally. Simultaneously, a growing number of conflicts against large-scale wind farms are emerging in multiple locations around the world. As these processes occur, new questions arise on how electricity from wind is being generated, how such energy is flowing within societies, and how these production-flows are being shaped by specific power structures. The present paper explores the expanding geography of wind energy conflicts by analyzing 20 case studies from across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. Based on the Environmental Justice Atlas database, it reflects on how land pressures and patterns of uneven development emerge as two features of the current expansion of wind farms. Following a relational analysis, these patterns are examined to interpret the plural instances of opposition emerging throughout the rural spaces of the world. The article argues that previously unexplored forms of collective action are expanding the scope and content of the \xe2\x80\x9cwind energy debate\xe2\x80\x9d. In addition to the claims of \xe2\x80\x9clandscape\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwildlife protection\xe2\x80\x9d addressed by the existing literature, this study sheds light on the rural/peripheral contexts where opposition emerges through the defense of indigenous territories,\xc2\xa0local livelihoods and communal development projects. The study contends that these \xe2\x80\x9cemerging storylines\xe2\x80\x9d embrace an environmental justice perspective when\xc2\xa0challenging the socially unequal and geographically uneven patterns reproduced by the ecological modernization paradigm. From this lens, cases of local opposition are not interpreted as selfish forces blocking a low-carbon transition, but instead, are understood as political instances that enable a wider discussion about the ways such transition\xc2\xa0should take place.'

Abstract: "Forest gardens are reconstructed natural forests, in which wild and cultivated plants coexist, such that the structural characteristics and ecological processes of natural forests are preserved, although the species composition has been adapted to suit human needs. These agroforests include a range of modified and transformed forests, and form an integral part of local land-use systems. They lie between natural forests and tree-crop plantations in terms of their structure and composition, and low intensity of forest extraction systems and the high intensity plantation systems in terms of their management intensity. Their management is characterized by combined use of silvicultural and horticultural operations, and spatial and temporal variations. These ecologically sustainable systems are often dynamic in species composition in response to changing socioeconomic conditions. Evolved over a long period of time as a result of local community's creativity, forest gardens have still received little attention in agroforestry research, just as in the case of the more intensively domesticated homegardens. The study of forest gardens offers good opportunities for obtaining a better understanding of the \xe2\x80\x98nature-analogous\xe2\x80\x99 agroforestry systems and for developing multifunctional agroforestry systems combining production and biodiversity values."

Abstract: 'Biodiversity is the very basis of human survival and economic well-being, and encompasses all life forms, ecosystems and ecological processes. The current estimates of the total number of species on earth vary from 5 to more than 100\xc2\xa0million, with a more conservative figure of 13.6\xc2\xa0million species. Of these, only 1.78\xc2\xa0million species have yet been described and awarded scientific names. Thus, our knowledge of diversity is remarkably incomplete. Biodiversity at any point in time is the balance between the rates of speciation and extinction. Biodiversity is not uniformly distributed on the earth and shows prominent latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. At least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past at geologic-time boundaries. Studies indicate that we have entered into the sixth phase of mass extinctions. In all ecosystem types, terrestrial, freshwater and marine, species populations are declining. The current rates of species extinction are 100\xe2\x80\x931000 times higher than the background rate of 10\xe2\x88\x927\xc2\xa0species/species year inferred from fossil record. It is now in the order of 1,000 species per decade per million species. Today we seem to be losing two to five species per hour from tropical forests alone. This amounts to a loss of 16\xc2\xa0m populations/year or 1,800 populations/h. Major drivers for changes of biodiversity in future, in decreasing rank of their impact are land use change, climate change, N deposition, biotic exchange and atmospheric loading of CO2. Accuracy of estimates of the total number of resident species and current rates of extinction remains undetermined, and the impact of species deletions on ecosystem function and stability is still a subject of debate among ecologists. There are two basic, often complementary strategies for biodiversity conservation. The in situ strategy emphasizes the protection of ecosystems for the conservation of overall diversity of genes, populations, species, communities and the ecological processes which are crucial for ecosystem services. Establishment of networks of protected areas are effective in this regard as these have the possibility to conserve primary forests and red-listed ecosystems. The concept of biodiversity banking could induce public participation. Establishment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, an independent, international science panel (like IPCC) would help coordinate and highlight research on pressing topics, conduct periodic assessments on regional as well as global scales and provide predictions.'

Title: 'A review of conservation legislation in Nepal: Past progress and future needs'

Abstract: 'Nepal is considered a leader among developing nations with regard to conservation legislation and programs; it was among the first Asian nations to develop national conservation legislation, sign CITES, and develop a national conservation strategy. We review the history of modern conservation law in Nepal from the Rana period (early 1950s) to the present. The early legislation focused mainly on strict preservation of areas and species; this phase culminated in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973. Subsequent legislation has evolved more in the direction of an integrated, holistic approach to conservation and is beginning to incorporate the participation of local people; subsequent amendments to the 1973 act allowed greater rights to rural villagers, and the designation of conservation areas in addition to the more strictly defined protected areas (national parks, wildlife reserves, etc.).'

Title: 'Ecology and Impacts of the Invasive Species, Lantana camara, in a Social-Ecological System in South India: Perspectives from Local Knowledge'
Author: 'Bharath\xc2\xa0Sundaram'

Abstract: 'We explored how the forest-dwelling Soliga community of South India views and explains biological invasions, and how local knowledge can inform scientific knowledge on biological invasions. We used an interview schedule with open-ended questions to solicit Soliga opinion on Lantana camara (lantana) invasion. The Soliga cited three reasons for lantana spread: its prolific fruit output and wide seed dispersal, change in fire management, and historical extraction of grass and bamboo. The Soliga believe that lantana invasion has had negative effects on the ecosystem and their livelihoods. Tabling scientific knowledge with local knowledge has improved our understanding of lantana invasion. The role of existing lantana in colonizing neighboring areas, and the response of native tree communities to lantana were common to both local and scientific sources. However, the Soliga view provides a more nuanced perspective of the lantana-fire relationship (contextually based on lantana density) with fires suppressing lantana when lantana density was low. This is contrary to views held by foresters and biologists, that fires are uniformly detrimental and promote lantana. Our study shows that examining Soliga observations has improved understanding of the invasion process and presents avenues for future lantana management.'

Title: 'Arthropods in biodiversity hotspots: the case of the Phytoseiidae (Acari: Mesostigmata)'
Author: 'M.-S.\xc2\xa0Tixier'
Date: 2009-03

Abstract: 'The biodiversity hotspot concept was defined by Myers in 1988 to determine priority areas for conservation. They have high endemism levels and have lost more than 70% of their original vegetated area. To date, there is little information on arthropod diversity in these zones. This work focuses on the biodiversity of the Phytoseiidae (Acari), one of the best known among the order Mesostigmata, in these threatened areas. These mites are usually predators and they are worldwide spread. Geographic distribution of phytoseiids in 27 biodiversity hostspots was assessed from data of the last world catalogue published in 2004. One thousand two hundred and thirty species are reported from at least one hotspot (62% of the total species number) and 604 species (30% of the total species number) are endemic to the 27 hotspots considered. The number of reports/publication in hotspot areas (2.6) is higher than in non-hotspot zones (1.5). Hotspots areas could be thus considered as a great reservoir of the Phytoseiidae diversity, just as they are for vertebrates and plants. Correlations between plant, vertebrate, mite diversity and endemism, as well as congruence rates between endemism levels of these three organisms suggest that the biodiversity patterns of plants and vertebrates mirror well those of the Phytoseiidae (both for endemicity and species richness). More intense conservation efforts in biodiversity hotspots would thus be assumed to affect plant and vertebrate biodiversity, as already known, but also arthropod biodiversity, as it was assumed. These results further support thus the importance of these zones in biodiversity conservation, even for organisms like mites, very small and poorly studied in this regards. More data on arthropods are, however, required to confirm these preliminary observations.'

Abstract: 'An analysis of human population trends from 2000 to 2010 shows that of the roughly one billion additional people on the planet today, a disproportionate number live in the biodiversity hotspots and tropical wilderness areas (TWAs). Although the annual population growth rate in the hotspots declined from 1.6 to 1.3\xc2\xa0%, the total population increased by 187 million people. While less densely populated, the TWAs grew at roughly twice the rate of the hotspots. Overall, slower growth rates are indicative of longer-term global trends in decreasing fertility, aging populations, and increased urbanization. The hotspots, however, are largely inhabited by people who have yet to enter their reproductive years or are in the early stages therein. The young age structure means that populations in these priority conservation areas will grow even as fertility rates fall further, and biodiversity will be forced to share dwindling natural habitat with ever more people.'

Title: 'Potential of cross-species microsatellite markers to assess population genetics of the endemic, endangered Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius)'

Abstract: 'Nilgiri tahr, the only wild representative of the Caprinae subfamily in Southern India, is endangered due to population decline, decreasing range size and limited geographical distribution, which together with habitat loss and fragmentation, further reduce its long-term viability. Planning conservation and management strategies to rehabilitate the species will require information on its population status and genetics. With an objective to assess the population genetics of Nilgiri tahr, we identified a panel of polymorphic microsatellite markers that amplify across the Caprinae species. We screened 50 pellet samples collected from four herds belonging to the largest remnant population of Nilgiri tahr in Eravikulam National Park, with 19 microsatellite markers, of which 17 polymorphic markers were selected for further tests. We observed varied levels of polymorphism (2\xe2\x80\x938 alleles) and heterozygosity (0.0476\xe2\x80\x930.8421). Probability of identity for individuals was 0.0018 at 10 loci and for siblings was 0.0062 at 13 loci, signifying the usefulness of these markers to study wild herds. Overall, observed and expected heterozygosities were H o\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.4280\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2376 and H e\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.4464\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2265, respectively, and the F IS value was 0.0138 (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.63). Our results validate the use of cross-species markers in wild populations of Nilgiri tahr to identify individuals and determine genetic diversity, which can be further used to understand population dynamics of this species.'

Abstract: 'Arjinshan National Nature Reserve (ANNR) is one of 3 refuges of the endemic ungulates Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang), Chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii) and wild yak (Bos mutus) that are endangered by natural and anthropogenic factors in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Identifying habitat suitability is critical for species protection management. We used a GIS-based niche model to delimit and classify habitat suitability using an integrated assessment system, which included 9 biotic and abiotic factors. We divided the research area into 4 habitat types for these ungulates: (1) high suitability habitat; (2) moderate suitability habitat; (3) low suitability habitat; and (4) unsuitable area. Results suggested that chiru have the most areas of high and moderate suitability habitats while Tibetan wild ass had the largest areas of low suitability habitat and unsuitable area. Wild yak had the largest area of moderate and low suitability habitat, but high suitability habitats for wild yak were smaller than those of other 2 ungulates. There was overlap of high-quality habitat for the three kinds of ungulates in the vicinity of Kardun inspection station, which could be regarded as the core area for the coexistence and conservation of these endangered ungulate populations.'

Abstract: 'Social organization of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) is not well understood in the absence of long-term studies of identified individuals. Adult Asian elephant females and their young offspring of both sexes form matriarchal groups, with pubertal males dispersing from natal groups, but whether these social groups represent families and whether males show locational or social dispersal were unknown. Using nuclear microsatellite loci amplified from dung-extracted DNA of free-ranging elephants in a large southern Indian population, we demonstrate that female-led herds comprise closely related individuals that are indeed families, and that males exhibit non-random locational dispersal.'

Title: 'Extraction of non-timber forest products in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. 4. impact on floristic diversity and population structure in a thorn scrub forest'
Author: 'Uma\xc2\xa0Shankar'
Date: 1998-07
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02862149
Abstract: 'Impact of extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was analyzed in a thorn scrub forest in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) wildlife sanctuary, India. Six species are most commonly extracted from BRT scrub for subsistence and income generation by an aboriginal tribe, the Soliga. Although the forest has been provided protection from indiscriminate felling since 1978 under a wildlife sanctuary cover, changes in vegetation structure are still occurring as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of fuelwood and other NTFPs. The results indicate that large woody species are being replaced by small woody species. The population structure also is becoming increasingly skewed to the smaller size classes due to extraction-bound mortality of the individuals, particularly those>7 cm dbh and above. The data suggest that the scrub community itself may be a manifestation of long persisting anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of a variety of forest products, and it currently represents a downward transition from a deciduous forest to a shrub thicket.'

Abstract: 'The advent of modern forces and the changes in socioeconomic patterns of forest dwellers have increased the pressures on the forests. In order to mitigate such pressures and also to protect the forests and wildlife the model of protected areas networks has shifted and enhanced such pressures in the unprotected natural forests due to several reasons. Being a low profile category of protected status and continuous human settlements, the present study highlights the case of dry deciduous forests of Sarguja district of Chhattisgarh state of India. The major objectives of this study were to quantify the status of forests and wildlife and also to determine the extent of anthropogenic disturbances faced by the dry deciduous forests of central India. Transect and silent drive count methods were used for sampling wildlife and quadrat method was used for sampling vegetation. Besides, the local uses of various forest produces were also studied in view of understanding the people dependency on forests. The forest vegetation, in the study area, was pre-dominated by Shorea robusta, which had Madhuca indica, Diospyrus melanoxylon and Buchnania lanzan as the major companion species. The forest had either the high girth class mature tree species or the saplings. The low vegetation cover and density were due to the high anthropogenic pressures mainly in the form of heavy livestock grazing and collection of ethnobotanically important species. The study though reveals that the area is not rich in wildlife and the forest is fragmented, the area still supports some important species, which include many rare and endangered plants and animals. The findings of this study have been discussed in view of the management and conservation of the forest and wildlife in the dry deciduous forests.'

Abstract: 'The Cauvery river basin of South India has a large phyto-floristic wealth, rightfully enough to constitute a separate phyto-geographic unit. Increase in the anthropogenic pressures within the river basin and surrounding landscapes have persistently stressed the riparian ecosystem structure adversely, besides altering its composition. The objective of this study was to examine the present status of riparian vegetation along the Cauvery river basin, in response to anthropogenic pressures. For vegetation analysis, the riparian forest coming in the middle stretch of Cauvery river was categorized into two zones, viz., forest zone covering ~54\xc2\xa0km stretch and agroecosystem zone covering ~80\xc2\xa0km stretch. In each zone, tree species were quantified using transects at 8-km interval. Overall tree species accounting for both forest and agroecosystem were recorded and compared. The results indicate that the mean density and basal area of trees per plot were higher in the forest zone than agroecosystem zone. The Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Weiner diversity of forest zone is 4.6, which is higher than agroecosystem. In addition, species composition indicated a relatively low or poor similarity between the two zones. The vegetation density and site disturbance scores for all the study sites reveals that sand mining and grazing areas have exerted negative impact on riparian forest. The results of the present study clearly brought out the need for preparing and implementing site-specific conservation plans for riparian ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'From March 2007 to March 2009 we quantified plant diversity at Chilapatta Reserve Forest in Terai Duars in the Indian eastern Himalayas. We sampled stratified random nested quadrats. Species richness was 311, representing 167 genera and 81 families. The species diversity index and concentration of dominance of the forest were 2.20 and 0.0072, respectively. Shannon-Wiener index and evenness indices were 4.77 and 1.44, respectively. The Importance Value Index (IVI) of species ranged from 0.13 to 37.94. The estimated diversity indices indicated heterogeneity of the forest in its composition, structure, function and dynamics. Rich forest plant diversity supports the need for continued conservation of tropical forests.'

Abstract: 'Ideally, the estimates of biological diversity of a community of species in a habitat should refer to the biological variation among the species and not merely to their numbers and frequencies. However, the current estimates of biodiversity incorporate only the latter two components but not the biological differences among the species. Ganeshaiah et al. [(1997) Current Science 73: 128\xe2\x80\x93133] have proposed an estimate called the Avalanche Index (AI) that can incorporate the biological heterogeneity among the species in a habitat. This estimate, besides being methodologically simple, can incorporate any quantifiable differences among the species, information on species richness and their frequencies in the habitat. In this paper we have estimated AI for tree vegetation in 14 forest types across different ecosystems of the world and have compared these estimates with other indices being currently used. Through this we have attempted to analyse the relative utility of AI in discriminating the habitats based on their biological heterogeneity by capturing their intra-community biological variation. We discuss the merits and demerits of the AI as a comprehensive estimate of biological diversity.'

Abstract: 'This study attempts to review the various biodiversity related parameters envisaged in the current national forest inventory (NFI) of India in comparison to those used worldwide as indicators of forest biodiversity. The study reveals that a good amount of biodiversity related parameters are available, covering the structural attribute of biodiversity, tree species composition, and other important functional attributes like deadwood and litter. In spite of this timber-based approach, a number of variables are available to talk on biodiversity aspects of Indian forests. However, the comparison with the parameters found in literature shows that the scope of further improvement does exist in current NFI\xe2\x80\x99s ability to contribute towards a documentation and management of biodiversity. Our gap analysis indicates that enhancing the capacity of the current NFI to generate overall biodiversity information urgently required for safeguarding and conserving the natural wealth of India is strongly needed.'

Abstract: 'The primary objective of this study is to estimate publics\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to pay (WTP) for environment conservation and analyze factors influencing WTP. A questionnaire survey based on the contingent valuation method (CVM) was carried out at Kanas Nature Reserve, Xinjiang, China. Seventy-three percent of the 412 respondents were willing to pay at different levels, and the mean WTP value was RMB 54.60 ($8.03). The results of this survey struck an optimistic note that publics were willing to contribute to improve environmental quality. Logistic regression analysis was employed to compare the characteristics of those who were and were not willing to pay. Chi-square tests were administered to identify the relationships between various explanatory factors and WTP. Conclusions and implications of the empirical study can be provided to policy makers and site managers. In a wider sense, the findings of this study should make a good contribution to the literature related to WTP for environment conservation of natural attractions.'

Abstract: 'Analysis of flotation samples from twelve sites in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (south India) provides clear evidence for the predominant subsistence plants of the Neolithic period (2,800\xe2\x80\x931,200\xc2\xa0cal b.c.). This evidence indicates that the likely staples were two pulses (Vigna radiata and Macrotyloma uniflorum) and two millet-grasses (Brachiaria ramosa and Setaria verticillata) which were indigenous to the Indian peninsula. At some sites there is evidence for limited cultivation of wheats (Triticum diococcum, Triticum durum/aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), and a few crops that originated in Africa, including hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana). In addition there is evidence for cotton (Gossypium sp.), and linseed (Linum sp.), as well as gathered fruits of Ziziphus and two Cucurbitaceae. This evidence suggests that the earliest agriculture in south India, dating to the third millennium b.c., was based on plants domesticated in the region, and that subsequently from the late 3rd millennium b.c. through the 2nd millennium additional crops from other regions were adopted into the subsistence system.'

Abstract: ' Shorea robusta Gaertn. f. (Sal) is one of the important timber-yielding plants in India, which dominates the vegetation of Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh state in India forming various communities based on its associations. The present study deals with delineation, mapping and characterization of various communities of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh, India ranging across over 16 districts. Field survey and visual interpretation based forest vegetation type classification and mapping was carried out as part of the project entitled \xe2\x80\x98Biodiversity characterization at landscape level using remote sensing and GIS\xe2\x80\x99. Indian Remote Sensing-P6 (Resourcesat-1) Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III satellite data was used during the study. The total area covered by different Sal forests was found to be approximately 2256.77 km2. Sal communities were identified and characterized based on their spectral properties, physiognomy and phytosociological characteristics. Following nine Sal communities were identified, delineated and mapped with reasonable accuracy viz., Chandar, Damar, dry plains, moist plains, western alluvium, western alluvium plains, mixed moist deciduous, mixed dry deciduous and Siwalik. It is evident from the area estimates that mixed moist deciduous Sal is the most dominant community in the region covering around (1613.90 km2), other major communities were found as western alluvium plains Sal (362.44 km2), mixed dry deciduous Sal (362.44 km2) and dry plains Sal (107.71 km2). The Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh faces tremendous anthropogenic pressure leading to deterioration of the forests. Community level information could be used monitoring the status as well as for micro level conservation and planning of the Sal forests in Terai Landscape of Uttar Pradesh.'

Abstract: 'This study\xe2\x80\x99s goal was to better understand the growth pattern and limitations of the herbaceous production that supports South India\xe2\x80\x99s rich large herbivore grazer assemblage. We conducted a fully factorial nitrogen and water (three levels each) treatment field experiment in the herbivore rich South Indian Western Ghats region to determine the seasonal pattern and the extent to which nitrogen and water availability limit herbaceous production. Graminoid production was found to be nitrogen limited. Despite low rainfall, additional water did not significantly increase overall biomass production nor extend growth in the dry season. Accumulated standing biomass was highest in the late wet season (November) and lowest in the dry season (May). Leaf nitrogen was highest in the early wet season (June) and lowest in the late dry season (March). Grazing had a positive effect on grass production by extending the growing season. Biomass production and graminoid leaf nitrogen concentration levels in the study area were similar to other tropical areas in the world. Also similar to other tropical large herbivore areas, the dry season poses an annual challenge for large herbivores in the study area \xe2\x80\x94particularly the smaller bodied species\xe2\x80\x94to satisfy their nutrient requirements.'

Abstract: 'The increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration is a major cause of global warming. This issue may be effectively addressed through sequestration of carbon in plants and soils. Here we studied the potential of vetiver, Vetiveria zizanioides L., to sequester carbon in field plots in Bangalore, India. Vetiver is a perennial and economically viable crop growing in tropical and subtropical regions. Vetiver has medicinal and aromatic properties. Vetiver shoot and root C amounts were measured. Results show that vetiver sequesters 15.24\xc2\xa0Mg C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in shoot and roots, much higher than that for lemongrass with 5.38, palmarosa with 6.14, and trees with 2.92. In addition the benefit/cost ratio of vetiver, 2.3, is higher than that of rice, 1.97. We estimate that vetiver cropping could sequester 150\xc2\xa0Tg per year in India, which is nearly 46\xc2\xa0% of C emissions in India.'

Abstract: 'This study investigates the influence of changes in spatial urbanization on the hydrological processes of Upper Bhima River basin of Maharashtra state, India using Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrological model based simulations. The simulated and observed monthly stream flow rates at the basin outlet were compared for calibration (1985\xe2\x80\x932004) and validation (2005\xe2\x80\x932014) of the SWAT model. For both the periods, Nash\xe2\x80\x93Sutcliffe efficiency values were >\xe2\x80\x890.70, root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) values were <\xe2\x80\x890.50 and percent bias values were <\xe2\x80\x8910. Hence, with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89 and 0.96 both the periods showed good agreement between simulated and observed stream flow rates. Urbanization indicators viz. population urbanization level (U p ) and spatial urbanization level (U s ) were estimated to quantify the growth patterns in population and urban areas respectively. Further, correlation analysis and Multivariate analysis of variance were performed between U s  and hydrological variables to study the influence of spatial urbanization on hydrological components for comprehending the existing relationships between them. Results reveal that from 1992 to 2014 with increase in U s  of 1.44 to 6.31, the average annual surface runoff increased from 438.22 to 448.61\xc2\xa0mm [standard deviation (\xcf\x83)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894.40; sum of squares (SS)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8958.20], whereas percolation decreased from 153.53 to 139.08\xc2\xa0mm (\xcf\x83\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x896.06; SS\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89110.10). These hydrological parameters are highly influenced by increase in urbanization. This study is relevant for water sources planners and policy makers for assessment of water resources for sustainable development in the urbanizing semi-arid river basins.'

Abstract: 'A collaborative crop specific exploration and collection mission to collect the germplasm and to study the population size of male and female/hermaphrodite trees of Malabar tamarind [Garcinia cambogia (Gaertn.) Desr.] in the area of its diversity was undertaken during July 2002 in Kerala and Karnataka. A total of 56 accessions of Malabar tamarind were collected. Two collections of Malabar tamarind were found to be very specific because of the uncommon fruit colour, which is pinkish red. All the collected accessions are grown at National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) Regional Station, Thrissur for characterisation and conservation. Extensive range of variability was found in fruit colour, shape, size and nature of branching and canopy of trees. Characterisation of 13 fruit and five seed characters was done for 51 accessions. The variability was found to be maximum for nipple length (74.8%) and minimum for fruit girth (12.8%). Two promising accessions were identified based on mean fruit weight (161\xc2\xa0g) in IC 354028 and mean rind thickness (15\xc2\xa0mm) and mean rind weight (125\xc2\xa0g) in IC 354019.'

Abstract: 'High-frequencyin vitro flowering is reported here fromin vitro regenerated shoots ofin vitro-raised seedlings of rare and endemicCeropegia lawii, Ceropegia maccannii, Ceropegia oculata, andCeropegia sahyadrica, as well as the widely distributedCeropegia bulbosa var.bulbosa andCeropegia hirsuta. In our first set of experiments, the MS medium contained 87 mM sucrose and was supplemented with varying concentrations of BAP (4.4 to 26.6 \xc2\xb5M). For the second set of trials, varying concentrations of sucrose (87 to 233 mM) were tested in MS media containing a constant 4.4 p.M BAP. Sub-cultured apical as well as axillary buds flowered with similar frequencies after 30 d of incubation. For all six species, the highest percentage of flowering shoots was obtained with either 26.6 \xc2\xb5M BAP or 175 mM sucrose. Although smaller in size, theirin vitro flowers were morphologically comparable within wVo-derived flowers. Variations among species were noted for the number of flower buds per shoot and the percentage of flower formation. Because all six species showed similar responses in both experiments, we can suggest that this protocol is applicable across the wide range ofCeropegia species.'

Abstract: 'Ceropegias has acquired significant importance due to their medicinal properties, edible tubers, and its ornamental flowers. The aim of this study was to optimize direct shoot organogenesis (DSO), indirect shoot organogenesis (ISO) and plant regeneration of threatened medicinal plant Ceropegia santapaui, followed by analysis of genetic status and biochemical characterization of micropropagated plantlets. For optimization, cotyledonary nodes and cotyledons were used as source of explants in DSO and ISO respectively. The highest frequency of regeneration (88.0\xc2\xa0%) for DSO with 8.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.6 shoots per explant was obtained from cotyledonary nodes cultured on Murashige and Skoog\xe2\x80\x99s (MS) medium containing 2.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 2iP. The best response for callus induction and proliferation was achieved with 1.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 PR (picloram) in which 97.5\xc2\xa0% of cultures produced an average of 913\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa010.9\xc2\xa0mg (fresh weight) of callus. The highest frequency of shoot formation (92.5\xc2\xa0%) with an average of 19.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.3 shoots in ISO was obtained when calli were transferred to MS medium supplemented with 2.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 BAP and 0.4\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 IBA. Regenerated shoots were best rooted in half-strength MS medium with 2.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 NAA. Plantlets successfully acclimatized were morphologically indistinguishable from the source plant. Micropropagated plantlets subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) marker based profiling reveled uniform banding pattern in DSO-derived plantlets which was similar to mother plant. ISSR fingerprints of ISO-derived plants showed low variation. Method of regeneration, plant part and solvent system significantly affected the levels of total phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity. Assay of antioxidant activity of different tissues revealed that significantly higher antioxidant activity was observed in ISO-derived tissues than DSO-derived and mother tissues. RP-HPLC analysis of micropropagated plantlets showed the presence of three major phenolic compounds which were similar to those detected in mother plant. Rapid multiplication rate, genetic stability and biochemical parameter ensures the efficacy of the protocol developed for the propagation of this threatened medicinal plant.'

Title: 'Stochastic Modeling of the Thermal Structure to Decipher the Lithospheric Thickness: Application to Dharwar Craton'

Abstract: 'A wide range of speculation regarding lithospheric thermal thickness in a region calls for quantifying the uncertainties associated with model parameters. In this paper, we present an attempt to decipher it by solving the differential equations governing the heat transfer through the lithosphere. Adequately quantifying the temperature field is very important, since it is highly dependent on the controlling thermal parameters. Thermal conductivity is modeled as a random parameter with a known mean value and correlation structure. We compute the temperatures in the crust and lithospheric mantle, along with their error bounds, using an analytical solution to the steady-state heat equation and the Adomian method of decomposition. We apply these solutions in the Archean Dharwar craton, which is divided into western Dharwar craton (WDC) and eastern Dharwar craton (EDC). We obtain a Moho temperature estimate of 304\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8958\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C in WDC, whilst in EDC it is 375\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8974\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C for a 20% coefficient of variability in thermal conductivity. The range of lithospheric thickness obtained for WDC is 150\xe2\x80\x93280\xc2\xa0km, and 110\xe2\x80\x93160\xc2\xa0km for the EDC. These values are in agreement with other geophysical and geological findings in the region. The thermal lithosphere obtained from this study is based on the mantle solidus and the surface wave seismological studies considering radial anisotropy reveal that the lithosphere is characterized by higher shear wave velocities, and decrease at the lithosphere\xe2\x80\x93asthenosphere boundary. Average shear velocity model for two different cratonic blocks (EDC and WDC) is used to show the LAB thickness for the eastern and western Dharwar craton. The two independent studies show a correlation in the lithospheric thickness.'

Abstract: 'Globally, ultramafic outcrops are renowned for hosting floras with high levels of endemism, including plants with specialised adaptations such as nickel or manganese hyperaccumulation. Soils derived from ultramafic regoliths are generally nutrient-deficient, have major cation imbalances, and have concomitant high concentrations of potentially phytotoxic trace elements, especially nickel. The South and Southeast Asian region has the largest surface occurrences of ultramafic regoliths in the world, but the geoecology of these outcrops is still poorly studied despite severe conservation threats. Due to the paucity of systematic plant collections in many areas and the lack of georeferenced herbarium records and databased information, it is not possible to determine the distribution of species, levels of endemism, and the species most threatened. However, site-specific studies provide insights to the ultramafic geoecology of several locations in South and Southeast Asia. The geoecology of tropical ultramafic regions differs substantially from those in temperate regions in that the vegetation at lower elevations is generally tall forest with relatively low levels of endemism. On ultramafic mountaintops, where the combined forces of edaphic and climatic factors intersect, obligate ultramafic species and hyperendemics often occur. Forest clearing, agricultural development, mining, and climate change-related stressors have contributed to rapid and unprecedented loss of ultramafic-associated habitats in the region. The geoecology of the large ultramafic outcrops of Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s Sulawesi, Obi and Halmahera, and many other smaller outcrops in South and Southeast Asia, remains largely unexplored, and should be prioritised for study and conservation.'

Abstract: 'Carbon forestry mitigation potential estimates at the global-level are limited by the absence or simplicity of national-level estimates, and similarly national-level estimates are limited by absence of regional-level estimates. The present study aims to estimate the mitigation potential for a large diverse country such as India, based on the GTAP global land classification system of agro-ecological zones (AEZs), as well the Indian AEZ system. The study also estimates the implications of carbon price incentive (US$50 and $100) on mitigation potential in the short-, medium- and long-term, since afforestation and reforestation (A & R) is constrained by lack of investment and financial incentives. The mitigation potential for short and long rotation plantations and natural regeneration was estimated using the GCOMAP global forest model for two land area scenarios. One scenario included only wastelands (29\xc2\xa0Mha), and the second enhanced area scenario, included wastelands plus long fallow and marginal croplands (54\xc2\xa0Mha). Under the $100 carbon price case, significant additional area (3.6\xc2\xa0Mha under the wasteland scenario and 6.4\xc2\xa0Mha under the enhanced area scenario) and carbon mitigation is gained in the short-term (2025) compared to the baseline when using the GTAP land classification system. The area brought under A & R increases by 85\xe2\x80\x93100% for the $100 carbon price compared to $50 carbon price in the short-term, indicating the effectiveness of higher carbon price incentives, especially in the short-term.'

Abstract: 'The bird fauna of logged and unlogged forest in Kibale National Park, western Uganda were studied and comparisons made. Species diversity and richness were higher in the logged areas. A single species, the Yellow-whiskered Greenbul Andropadus latirostris dominated in the logged compartment. However, the majority of individual birds found in the logged forest were generalist or forest-edge species. Over 84% of the forest interior specialist species that occurred in primary forest had recolonized or persisted in the logged forest; however, there were seven out of 48 understorey forest specialists that had not done so. Although there was moderate species overlap between the two habitats, the logged forest compartment had not fully recovered from logging after 23 years.'

Abstract: ' Nothapodytes nimmoniana is an endemic endangered tree and convenient source for large scale isolation of anticancer alkaloid camptothecin. Due to indiscriminate collection of its wood chips for camptothecin, population of the species is under heavy exploitation pressure in India. Plant tissue culture techniques offer alternative strategies for clonal propagation and camptothecin production to meet demand of the alkaloid along with conservation of the species. Several strategies are employed to enhance in vitro response through seed germination, culture medium optimisation for camptothecin production and clonal propagation. Cryopreservation of embryonic axes is an approach employed in short term preservation of the species. Scale up for the production of camptothecin from N. nimmoniana in bioreactor is a future possibility to meet pharmaceutical market demand and mitigate exploitation of natural population. In this article, we reviewed progress made so far on clonal propagation and camptothecin production in N. nimmoniana. We assessed the challenges and status of camptothecin production in N. nimmoniana by application of in vitro techniques.'

Abstract: 'Debates on linking livelihoods and conservation through the commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) continue to hold significance considering the increasing market demand for NTFPs, its high economic value for forest-dependent communities and \xe2\x80\x9cenabling\xe2\x80\x9d neoliberal policies that are in place. Kerala, located on the southwest coast of India, flanked by the Western Ghats\xe2\x80\x94a UN declared biodiversity hot spot, on its windward side, is of particular significance due to the presence of the Ayurvedic industry\xe2\x80\x94a traditional medicine industry that procures 90\xc2\xa0% of its raw materials from the wild. In addition, the presence of a resource-dependent tribal population re-affirms the economic, social and cultural significance of NTFPs. Unsustainable practices and poor co-management and marketing arrangements have rendered the sector ineffective in terms of meeting livelihood as well as conservation goals in the region. Although new approaches such as NTFP certification are being recommended for India not much has been reported on its feasibility and/or implementation challenges. Focusing on the Kadar community of Kerala, this study attempts to highlight some of the issues within the sector and using an \xe2\x80\x9cinstrumental model\xe2\x80\x9d, present the benefits accrued from new strategies such as NTFP certification through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Last but not least, recommendations for the adoption of sustainable strategies in context with the existing policy environment are provided that may be broadly applicable to other forest-dependent communities in India and elsewhere.'

Abstract: 'The present work aimed to evaluate the riparian species diversity of five subwatersheds of the Meenachil river basin (1208.1\xc2\xa0km2) and to compare that with the main river channel. A total of 441 species were recorded belonging to 106 families. The Leguminosae was represented by the highest number of species (39 spp.) followed by Poaceae (25 spp.). The quantitative features such as density and importance value index of species varied greatly. In the present study, the diversity index of shrubs and herbs was found to be higher than the tree species. The concentration of dominance was recorded highest in the tree species. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) ranged from 1.0 to 2.95. The Margalef\xe2\x80\x99s species richness index varied from 2.43 to 6.69, equitability or evenness index varied from 0.62 to 1.42, the species heterogeneity index varied from 0.4 to 0.83, and Mc Intosh diversity index varied from 56.57 to 329.27. A greater number of tree species fell in 41\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm girth at breast height, but less number of tree individuals is represented in above 100-cm diameter class.'

Abstract: 'Cloud forests in central Guatemala are fragmented and decreasing in area due to slash-and-burn agricultural activities. We studied bird species composition, abundance, guild composition, and site tenacity of a 102\xc2\xa0ha plot located in a cloud forest region of the Sierra Yalijux in Guatemala, half of which was primary forest and half young secondary forest (<7-years-old). Of the 100 species present 14 were restricted to the Endemic Bird Area \xe2\x80\x98Northern Central American highlands\xe2\x80\x99 (i.e. 66% of a total of 21 endemics). Five of the 100 analysed species, including one of the restricted-range species (Troglodytes rufociliatus), had a significantly different abundance in primary and secondary forests. Theoretical analysis suggests that seven species out of a community comprised of 141 bird species are already extirpated and only three out of the 14 present restricted-range species might survive the current state of deforestation. Insectivores were the dominant guild on the plot in terms of numbers of species, followed by omnivores, frugivores and granivores. However, in terms of individuals, omnivores made up nearly half of the bird individuals in primary forest, but declined by 44% in secondary forest, whereas granivores more than doubled in this habitat type. Numbers of species per guild were not significantly different between habitats, while numbers of individuals per guild were significantly different. In general, individuals per species are significantly different in the two habitats. Results suggest that most of the species that are currently surviving in the remnant forests of the Sierra Yalijux might be fairly well adapted to a range of forest conditions, but that populations of a number of restricted-range species might be small. Even generalists species like the Common Bush Tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus) are less abundant in secondary vegetation than in primary forest of the study plot.'

Abstract: 'White-eyes (Zosterops spp.) are a group of small passerines distributed across the Eastern Hemisphere that have become a textbook example of rapid speciation. However, traditional taxonomy has relied heavily on conservative plumage features to delimit white-eye species boundaries, resulting in several recent demonstrations of misclassification. Resolution of confused taxonomy is important in order to correctly delimit species and identify taxa which may require conservation, particularly in Asia where the songbird trade is decimating wild populations. In this study, we aim to untangle multiple instances of confused taxonomic treatment in three large, widespread Asian wastebasket species complexes of white-eye (Oriental White-eye Zosterops palpebrosus, Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus and Mountain White-eye Zosterops montanus) renowned for their conservative morphology. Using mitochondrial DNA from 173 individuals spanning 42 taxa, we uncovered extensive polyphyly in Z. palpebrosus and Z. japonicus and propose some radically revised species limits under which former members of Z. palpebrosus and Z. japonicus would be reassigned into four and two different species, respectively. The revised taxonomy results in a net loss of two previously recognized species and a net gain of two newly recognized species, leading to significant taxonomic change but a lack of additional species-level diversity. One of the newly elevated species, Zosterops melanurus from Java and Bali, is also the world\xe2\x80\x99s most heavily traded songbird and requires urgent conservation attention.'

Abstract: 'Fungal endophytes inhabit living tissues of plants without any apparent symptoms and in many cases are known to produce secondary metabolites similar to those produced by their respective host plants. However on sub-culture, the endophytic fungi gradually attenuate their ability to produce the metabolites. Attenuation has been a major constraint in realizing the potential of endophytic fungi as an alternative source of plant secondary metabolites. In this study, we report attempts to restore camptothecine (CPT) production in attenuated endophytic fungi isolated from CPT producing plants, Nothapodytes nimmoniana and Miquelia dentata when they are passed through their host plant or plants that produce CPT and when treated with a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. Attenuated endophytic fungi that traversed through their host tissue or plants capable of synthesizing CPT, produced significantly higher CPT compared to the attenuated fungi. Attenuated fungus cultured in the presence of 5-azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, had an enhanced CPT content compared to untreated attenuated fungus. These results indicate that the attenuation of CPT production in endophytic fungi could in principle be reversed by eliciting some signals from plant tissue, most likely that which prevents the methylation or silencing of the genes responsible for CPT biosynthesis.'

Abstract: 'Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) rhizome has great demand in food and pharmaceutical industry. Odisha is the second largest  ginger-cultivating state, and considered as best suitable after Kerala, in India. Forty-eight germplasm from 10 agro-climatic zones of Odisha were genetically characterized and potential duplicates were identified employing 25 polymorphic markers (RAPD, ISSR, SSR). These markers together amplified 170 polymorphic, 136 monomorphic, and 2 unique bands. SSR markers were the most efficient in generating highest primer resolving power (44.85), primer index (10.28), and number of polymorphic bands (67). Genotype\xe2\x80\x93environment interaction was clearly demonstrated from UPGMA dendrogram based on\n Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s similarity coefficients and SAHN clustering which divided 48 samples into 8 sub-clusters (showing 80\xc2\xa0% congruence with their places of geographical origin). H (0.211), I (0.38), and Gst (0.239) indices revealed genetic diversity within and genetic differentiation among 10 populations. AMOVA showed higher genetic variability among populations (64\xc2\xa0%) than within populations (36\xc2\xa0%). Ginger accessions having a mean genetic distance less than 0.21 (threshold average genetic distance) were considered redundant. Forty-eight samples could be reduced to 11 genetically diverse groups (each group contains duplicates but is different from each other) which confirmed 77\xc2\xa0% of the collection to be redundant. Identification of duplicates can be useful to eliminate confusion regarding synonyms among farmers, help selection of suitable ginger seed material, and facilitate judicious management of germplasm in conservatory. Genetic diversity analysis unraveled the scope of genetic improvement and breeding program. Clustering analysis showed grouping of majority of samples to respective agro-climatic zones and established the possible interaction between genotype and environment.'

Quartz layers of the heavy mineral-rich zone collected at a depth of ~2\xc2\xa0m from the landward foot of the dunes in the Visakhapatnam and Odisha coast, gave the OSL age estimates as 1,050\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8950 and 260\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0years respectively, revealing that the age of the dunes in Visakhapatnam are older than those on the Odisha coast. Episodic high energy events have affected the coast. Evidence from ground penetrating radar data consists of three stratigraphic units. The upper unit consists of vague reflections, parallel to the ground in continuous manner, most probably formed by wind action. On the other hand, the middle layer shows high amplitude reflections of heavy mineral-rich massive layers, possibly the result of tsunami activity. The lower massive layer parallel to the ground surface shows a low reflection pattern. The GPR studies showed that the thickness of the heavy mineral layers is greater on the landward foot of the dune as compared to that on the seaward side. According to the grain size analysis, the dune is composed of both wind generated and tsunamigenic sediments. The scanning electron microscope studies revealed that the heavy minerals present in the dunes are mainly sillimanite, ilmenite, garnet, pyroxene, rutile, sphene, biotite, hornblende, zircon, monazite and magnetite. The study demonstrates the origin of sand dunes in different ages along the East Coast of India by the effect of various natural phenomena.'

Abstract: 'In the last years, India has taken a number of initiatives to boost small hydropower development based on the assumption of being a green energy source with only limited disturbances on the social and natural environments. However, its real environmental performances have not been examined. The intention of this paper is to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of Small Hydropower Plants (SHPs) in India in light of their exemption from any Environmental Clearance procedures.'

Abstract: 'Rainfall intensities measured at a few stations in Kerala during 2001\xe2\x80\x932005 using a disdrometer were found to be in reasonable agreement with the total rainfall measured using a manual rain gauge. The temporal distributions of rainfall intensity at different places and during different months show that rainfall is of low intensity (< 10 mm/hr), 65% to 90% of the time. This could be an indication of the relative prevalence of stratiform and cumuliform clouds. Rainfall was of intensity < 5 mm/hr for more than 95% of the time in Kochi in July 2002, which was a month seriously deficient in rainfall, indicating that the deficiency was probably due to the relative absence of cumuliform clouds. Cumulative distribution graphs are also plotted and fitted with the Weibull distribution. The fit parameters do not appear to have any consistent pattern. The higher intensities also contributed significantly to total rainfall most of the time, except in Munnar (a hill station). In this analysis also, the rainfall in Kochi in July 2002 was found to have less presence of high intensities. This supports the hypothesis that the rainfall deficiency was probably caused by the absence of conditions that favoured the formation of cumuliform clouds.'

Abstract: 'Tropical regions are experiencing unprecedented economic and population growth. This goes hand in hand with increase habitat fragmentation of tropical ecosystems. Understanding the genetic consequences of these spatial and temporal changes across landscapes is critical to conservation of the vast majority of global biodiversity. This virtual issue of Conservation Genetics, presents six empirical and one review paper showcasing fascinating and important findings with regard to how habitat fragmentation impacts on genetic diversity in rare or endangered tropical species. The message from these papers is clear, fragmentation has a number of serious genetic consequences, which can contribute to undermining the viability of species in fragmented landscapes. Conservation genetics provides a powerful tool to inform both conservation and management of species and genetic resources. But, careful consideration is needed to ensure studies apply appropriate sampling designs and genetic analysis to better test hypothesis. Next generation genomics offers great opportunities to provide even more answers and greater resolution of the consequences for adaptive genetic variation, to ensure future tropical landscapes are resilient.'

Abstract: 'The subterranean parts of many wild plants form an important constituent of traditional diet of the tribal inhabitants of Similipal Biosphere Reserve, Odisha especially in times of food scarcity during critical periods. However, no specific study has been made so far on this aspect. The present study was conducted during 2008\xe2\x80\x932012 as a search for sources of food and to assess the dietary diversity, consumption pattern, culinary uses and prioritized species of wild tuberous plants sustained by local tribes. The exploration and germplasm collection missions along with intensive botanical survey, focus group discussions, structured household interview and market survey were conducted in 30 villages interacting with 102 key informants of core and buffer zones. A total of 55 wild edible tuberous species representing 37 genera and 24 families were inventoried including 17 species used during food deficiency to meet seasonal shortages. The analyzed data contributed 5 use categories, 4 preparation methods, 7 kinds of food items, 10 species as children snacks, 35 species of pharma-foods and 20 prioritized species. Ten species were domesticated by tribes thus reducing threats on wild tubers and 20 species were traded in local markets to generate additional income exemplifying economic benefits from wild tubers. Seventeen species were identified as novel uses of food items from India. The findings suggested that the nutritional profile along with pharmaceutical attributes of preferred wild food plants be analyzed for recommending suitable species for better nutrition and development of nutraceuticals. Further, many genetic resources of these wild tuberous species of agri-horticultural importance constitute the wild genepool hence their economic and breeding potential along with desirable attributes need to be investigated for utilization in crop improvement programmes.'

Abstract: 'The genetic diversity of eight species of Piper (Piperaceae) viz., P. nigrum, P. longum, P. betle, P. chaba, P. argyrophyllum, P. trichostachyon, P. galeatum, and P. hymenophyllum from Kerala state, India were analyzed by Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Out of 22 10-mer RAPD primers screened, 11 were selected for comparative analysis of different species of Piper. High genetic variations were found among different Piper species studied. Among the total of 149 RAPD fragments amplified, 12 bands (8.05%) were found monomorphic in eight species. The remaining 137 fragments were found polymorphic (91.95%). Species-specific bands were found in all eight species studied. The average gene diversity or heterozygosity (H) was 0.33 across all the species, genetic distances ranged from 0.21 to 0.69. The results of this study will facilitate germplasm identification, management, and conservation.'

Title: 'Community structure and demography of small-mammal populations in insular montane forests in southern India'
Author: 'Kartik\xc2\xa0Shanker'

Abstract: ' Small mammals were studied in insular montane forest patches in the Upper Nilgiris in southern India from February 1994 to September 1996. Nine patches were selected at two sites, one with a single large 600-ha patch, the other with several small patches ranging in size from 0.2 to 60 ha. The population characteristics and community structure of small mammals were studied in relation to patch size and habitat structure within the patches. The two most abundant species were Rattus rattus (2\xe2\x80\x9336 individuals/ha) and Suncus montanus  (0\xe2\x80\x9311 individuals/ha), while the abundance of seven other species recorded were very low. The population characteristics of R. rattus examined were density, biomass, proportions of juveniles, sub-adults and adults, mean weight of all animals, mean weight of adults, sex ratio and persistence. The proportion of adults, sub-adults, mean weight of animals, and mean weight of adult males were correlated with patch size. Persistence of sub-adult females in the large patch was especially high. The density and biomass of other small-mammal species were also studied. Two indices of diversity, species richness and proportion of R.\xe2\x90\xa3rattus were compared as measures of community structure. Seven habitat characteristics were measured; of these, canopy cover, canopy height and tree density were correlated with the size of the patch. Density and biomass of species other than R. rattus and proportion of R. rattus were correlated with canopy height. Density and biomass of species other than R. rattus were highest in smaller patches. While the population characteristics of R. rattus may be affected by patch size, the density of rare species may be influenced by factors related to lower canopy height. Migration between patches may be an important factor in maintaining populations in these patches.'

Abstract: 'Most of the mountainous regions in tropical humid climatic zone experience severe soil loss due to natural factors. In the absence of measured data, modeling techniques play a crucial role for quantitative estimation of soil loss in such regions. The objective of this research work is to estimate soil loss and prioritize the sub-watersheds of Kali River basin using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. Various thematic layers of RUSLE factors such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), topographic factor (LS), crop management factor (C), and support practice factor (P) have been prepared by using multiple spatial and non-spatial data sets. These layers are integrated in geographic information system (GIS) environment and estimated the soil loss. The results show that \xe2\x88\xbc42\xc2\xa0% of the study area falls under low erosion risk and only 6.97\xc2\xa0% area suffer from very high erosion risk. Based on the rate of soil loss, 165 sub-watersheds have been prioritized into four categories\xe2\x80\x94very high, high, moderate, and low erosion risk. Anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, construction of dams, and rapid urbanization are the main reasons for high rate of soil loss in the study area. The soil erosion rate and prioritization maps help in implementation of a proper watershed management plan for the river basin.'

Abstract: 'The present study describes the floristic composition and dominance pattern of sal forests in Ranchi, Jharkhand, eastern India. Vegetation was studied in 47 belt transects\xc2\xa0(50\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89100\xc2\xa0m) that had 137 plant species (110 identified and 27 unidentified) belonging to 51 families. The family Fabaceae with 17 species (8 spp. belonging to subfamily Faboideae, 6 spp. to Caesalpinioideae and 3 spp. to Mimosoidieae) contributed the most to diversity, followed by Rubiaceae (8 spp.) and Euphorbiaceae (6 spp.). Tree density in sal was inversely related to species richness. Total tree density (\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0cm GBH) in the studied forests was 397 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921, with a basal cover of 262.50\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. Important plants of conservation concern are Pterocarpus marsupium Roxb, Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall, Sterculiaurens Roxb.,\xc2\xa0Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, and Asparagus densiflorus (Kunth) Jessop. Phanerophytes had the highest percentage (71%, with percentage deviation from normal life form of +\xe2\x80\x8925) followed by therophyte (15%, with percentage deviation +\xe2\x80\x892). Observed percentage deviation from normal life form was much lower (with +\xe2\x80\x892 percentage deviation) in both chamaephytes (8%) and therophytes (15%), suggesting that the studied sal forests are favorable for supporting various plants species. The forest management strategies should focus on the increasing demands for different timber and non-timber forest products to conserve the plant diversity of these natural forests.'

Abstract: 'Detailed information on the ground-dwelling ant diversity and distribution in the rainforests of the Congo Basin is lacking so far. A new ant species list from a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest on the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon is presented. We investigated the effect of vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and 2004\xe2\x80\x932005. Our site in Cameroon had a total observed ant diversity of 145 species. Vegetation type significantly influenced the ground-dwelling and -foraging (arboreal) ant assemblages. Differences in species density, activity and composition between vegetation types were explained not only by soil type (hydromorphous \xe2\x80\x93 terra firme), but also by developmental stage of vegetation types. The highly inundated Raphia-swamp had the lowest ant species density and activity. Older secondary forests still had a different species composition than near primary forest even after 25 years of recovery after anthropogenic disturbance. Finally, the high ant species number captured by our pitfalls, the absence of the invasive exotic ant Wasmannia auropunctata and the high Dorylus (Anomma) army ant diversity confirm the importance of the Cameroonian rainforest for biodiversity conservation programs.'

Abstract: 'Serious attempts have been made to manage the highly populated Indian coast during the last 25\xc2\xa0years in terms of regulating the activities and managing disasters. This has lead to formulation of various policies to maintain environmental quality and sustainably manage the coastal resources. Basically, the coastal zone needs to address the demands of all the stakeholders starting from traditional local communities, administrators, to academic researchers etc. India has faced tremendous challenges in implementing regulatory measures like Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) issued in 1991 by demarcating countries coast in to four different zones with provisions and prohibitions for various activities. The concept of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been taken with the support of spatial decision-support tools derived from satellite data including national programmes on inter-sectoral approaches towards ICZM. 2004 onwards a series of disasters have reminded the necessity of having regulatory measures through implementable approaches. Subsequently, the CRZ 2011 notification has been a new addition to the list of policies using bottom-up approach as a good governance tool. The country has strengthened its potential in coastal management, disaster management and several community based field projects to enhance participation of stakeholders. This paper is aimed to critically review the processes that are made during the last two decades including the future challenges towards sustainable management of coastal zone with special emphasis on the three coastal areas from eastern, western and southern coast of India.'

Title: 'Convention on Biological Diversity: a review of national challenges and opportunities for implementation'

Abstract: 'The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) lies at the heart of biodiversity conservation initiatives. It offers opportunities to address global issues at the national level through locally grown solutions and measures. This article reviews the national challenges and opportunities in meeting requirements of the CBD by analysing twenty Third National Reports (TNRs), covering five different CBD regional clusters from the three global economic groups. While there is a plethora of challenges, the predominant ones discussed in this study include: institutional and capacity, knowledge and accessible information, economic policy and financial resources, cooperation and stakeholder involvement, and mainstreaming and integration of biodiversity. The underlying problem is that limited capacity in developing countries and transition economies undermines conservation initiatives. Lack of capacity in science, coordination, administration, legislation, and monitoring are barriers to on-ground implementation of biodiversity programmes. Opportunities to overcome these challenges embrace use of knowledge products, information-sharing mechanisms, participatory platforms, educational programmes, multi-level governance, and policy coherence. Innovative market-based instruments are also being trialled in various countries, which seek to offer incentives to local communities. The article concludes that conservation measures should be supported by multiple sectors and secure high level political support. Political, economical, and legislative sectors are more likely to show interest in CBD implementation and use it as a tool for managing biodiversity when they know the Convention processes and perceive it as a benefit. Modest investments in capacity building and training, and engaging different sectors in setting priorities would have a significant pay-off.'

Abstract: 'High densities of people living around protected areas (PAs) in South Asia require management strategies to balance conservation goals and livelihood needs. Based on a survey of 777 households around five PAs in India and Nepal, this paper provides a comparative perspective of Indian and Nepali households\xe2\x80\x99 views of protected area benefits and costs, their attitude toward conservation in general, and attitude toward protected area staff. Results indicate mixed responses towards tourism, varying from very favorable in Nepal to less favorable in India. The majority (81%) held positive attitudes towards the existence and importance of PAs but had negative perceptions of PA staff (69%). Most residents perceived benefits from access to fuel wood, fodder and other PA resources including benefits from tourism, while crop and livestock losses from wildlife were the main costs. Households overall positive attitudes towards the PAs and conservation despite high losses from living around PAs suggests that local residents may support conservation if their livelihood needs are met. Comparisons of household attitudes and perceptions suggest that locally based strategies rather than top-down approaches are likely to be more effective. Extending PA benefits to smaller landholders, households that are highly resource-dependent or experiencing higher income losses from human-wildlife conflicts, and less educated residents are particularly important to balance costs and losses from living around protected areas.'

Title: 'Is ecotourism a panacea? Political ecology perspectives from the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India'

Abstract: 'Ecotourism is increasingly being promoted as an instrument that helps local socio-economic development and generate revenues to strengthen conservation of critically endangered biodiversity. It is often posited the magic bullet particularly across protected areas in the Global South. In theory, ecotourism can provide economic benefits to economically weaker communities living around protected areas and inspire them to protect the biodiversity in their own interest. This paper, however, provides empirical evidence that the so-called win\xe2\x80\x93win is not an unqualified truism. With a case study on Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, world\xe2\x80\x99s largest mangrove biodiversity and home of highly endangered Royal Bengal Tiger, this article examines complexities involved in ecotourism and urges the need to make it context-specific. It assesses ecotourism\xe2\x80\x99s ability to provide livelihood alternatives to local communities and how can it help in conservation. The findings demonstrate an unequal, uneven, and skewed accumulation of benefits of ecotourism, often associated with market mechanisms of global environmental protection. As little as 36% of the interviewees claimed receiving direct or indirect benefits from ecotourism, the study finds. It failed to offer any benefits at all to the poorest and most marginal communities. On the contrary, it offered disproportionately larger returns to the remotely located capital invested in the local ecotourism facilities in the Sundarbans, thus defeating the principle behind the mechanism. In the area of conservation, tourism was blamed for increasing pollution and harming the health of the ecosystem by tourists who were considered \xe2\x80\x98outsiders\xe2\x80\x99 and insensitive to the ecology by the locals and conservation agencies alike.'

Abstract: ' Nothapodytes nimmoniana Graham is an important medicinal tree species occurring in the Western Ghats, a mega diversity hotspot in Southern India. The inner stem bark of the tree contains an important anti-cancer alkaloid, camptothecine (CTP), for which the natural population of the trees is heavily extracted. In this paper, we report the development of a rapid, high frequency regeneration protocol from leaf and nodal explants of N. nimmoniana. Multiple shoot induction was carried out using leaf and nodal explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentration/combination of phyto-hormones. N6-benzyladenine (BA) was the most effective cytokinin for the induction of multiple shoots. The MS medium with 8.87\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M BA yielded the highest number of shoots from leaf and nodal explants, respectively. Further, proliferation and elongation of adventitious buds were observed in secondary medium containing MS supplemented with 4.44\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M BA and 0.87\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M gibberellic acid (GA3). Shoots were rooted on half strength MS medium containing 4.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M indole-3-butyric acid. The plantlets were acclimatized in a growth chamber at 25\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, 60\xc2\xa0% relative humidity, with 16/8\xc2\xa0h light/dark photoperiod. Regenerated plants were free of any noticeable phenotypic variability and showed a survival rate of 90\xc2\xa0%. The in vitro regenerated plants accumulated substantial amount of camptothecine (ranging from 0.08 to 0.2\xc2\xa0%). These results suggest the possibility of using in vitro regenerated plants as a possible alternative source of CPT. This is the first report of direct regeneration in N. nimmoniana with significantly high plant regeneration frequency and with high CPT yield.'

Abstract: 'The Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) of India, as a whole, faces a severe shortage of water despite receiving a high annual rainfall, this is primarily due to excess runoff and lack of water conservation practices. In this study, an attempt is made to identify zones favourable for the application and adaptation of site-specific artificial-recharge techniques for augmentation of groundwater through a Geographical Information System (GIS) based hydrogeomorphic approach in the Bhatsa and Kalu river basins of Thane district, in western DVP. The criteria adopted for the GIS analysis were based on the hydrogeomorphological characteristics of both basins extracted from the IRS-1C LISS-III data supported by information on drainage pattern, DEM derived slope, lineament density, drainage density, and groundwater condition. The integrated study helps design a suitable groundwater management plan for a basaltic terrain.'

Abstract: 'Larvae of almost all of the 5,680 species of the insect order Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are dependent on freshwater habitats. Both larvae and adults are predators. The order is relatively well studied, and the actual number of species may be close to 7,000. Many species have small distributional ranges, and are habitat specialists, including inhabitants of alpine mountain bogs, seepage areas in tropical rain forests, and waterfalls. They are often successfully used as indicators for environmental health and conservation management. The highest diversity is found in flowing waters in rain forests of the tropics, the Oriental and Neotropical regions being the most speciose. This paper discusses diversity, summarises the biogeography of dragonflies in the different biogeographical regions and gives the total number of species and genera per family per biogeographical region. Examples are given of areas of particular diversity, in terms of areas of endemism, presence of ancient lineages or remarkable recent radiations but no well-based review of areas with high endemism of dragonflies is available so far. The conservation status of dragonflies is briefly discussed. Species confined to small remnants of forest in the tropics are most under threat of extinction by human activities.'

Abstract: 'Grain legumes contribute significantly to total world food production. Legumes are the primary source of dietary proteins in many developing countries, where protein hunger and malnutrition are widespread. Grain legumes germplasm constitute ~15% of the 7.4\xc2\xa0M accessions preserved globally. Nearly, 78% of the CGIAR\xe2\x80\x99s, 0.217\xc2\xa0M accessions, have been characterized, compared to 34% of national genebank collections. Interestingly, limited data on grain quality are available as the primary focus has been on morpho-agronomic traits. Clearly, more resources should be targeted on biochemical evaluation to identify nutritionally rich and genetically diverse germplasm. The formation of core and mini core collections has provided crop breeders with a systematic yet manageable entry point into global germplasm resources. These subsets have been reported for most legumes and have proved useful in identifying new sources of variation. They may however not eliminate the need to evaluate entire collections, particularly for very rare traits. Molecular characterization and association mapping will further aid to insights into the structure of legume diversity and facilitate greater use of collections. The use of high resolution elevational climate models has greatly improved our capacity to characterize plant habitats and species\xe2\x80\x99 adaptive responses to stresses. Evidence suggests that there has been increased use of wild relatives as well as new resources resulting from mutagenesis to enhance the genetic base of legume cultigens.'

Out of 884 nucleotide positions generated in ATPase 8/6 genes, 76 were polymorphic. The study suggested 23 unique haplotypes from 67 individuals of nine populations collected from different riverine systems of India. The ATPase 8/6 sequence revealed highest haplotype as well as nucleotide diversities in Imphal River population and lowest diversities in Tapti River population. The pattern of genetic diversity and haplotype network indicated distinct mitochondrial lineages for Chaliyar population, whereas mismatch distribution strongly suggested a population expansion in mid pleistocene epoch (0.4 Mya) with distinct genetic structuring in C. striata. The baseline information on genetic variation and the population sub-structuring would facilitate conservation and management of this important snakehead murrel.'

Abstract: 'Eleven accessions of an under-utilized legume, Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. utilis (Wall. ex Wight) Baker ex Burck (velvet bean) were collected from four districts of South India and their agronomic characters were evaluated. The vegetative growth characters such as the germination percentage, plant height, number of leaves and branches per plant were recorded. The yield based characters such as the number of clusters/plant (4\xe2\x80\x9314), number of flowers/cluster (3\xe2\x80\x9315) and the fertility index (66\xe2\x80\x9391%) were observed. The seed yield reaches 2.9\xe2\x80\x936.9\xc2\xa0t/ha. The number of seeds per pod, seed weight and the seed recovery percentage were also calculated. The level of diversity in the agrobotanical traits of velvet bean observed in the present study could be of interest in a breeding programme.'

Abstract: 'An attempt has been made to diagnose the orographic rainfall associated with internal gravity waves excited by the Assam\xe2\x80\x93Burma hills (ABH) in India, during south west monsoon season (SWMS). To develop this model ABH has been synthesised by two 3-D elliptical barriers, separated by a valley of some finite distance. In this paper, a three dimensional frictionless, laminar, adiabatic, boussinesq, non-rotating and inviscid moist airflow with realistic vertical variation of wind and temperature, has been considered. Here also the basic flow consists of two components such as zonal wind component U(z) and meridional wind component V(z). The perturbation technique is used to linearise the governing equations of the airflow and to obtain perturbation vertical velocity (\\(w^{\\prime}\\)) the quasi-numerical approach have been used. The perturbation vertical velocity (\\(w^{\\prime}\\)) is used to compute the rainfall intensity (RFI) over ABH during SWMS. Also, we examine the sensitivity of the computed RFI on the length (d) of the valley. Finally, the computed results have compared with Gridded Rainfall Data set, generated by India meteorological Department (IMD), India.'

Abstract: 'We examined the effects of forest patch size on woody tree species richness and abundance in tropical montane evergreen forest patches of the Nilgiri region, south India. We sampled woody trees (\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh) from 21 forest patches in the upper Nilgiri hills (>\xc2\xa02000\xc2\xa0m elevation) and recorded a total of 35,146 individuals of 61 species, 45 genera and 30 families. Species richness and abundance of sapling/shrubs (\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa01 to <\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0dbh) increased significantly with increasing patch size, but the species richness and abundance of small, medium and larger trees (\xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa010 to <\xc2\xa030, \xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa030 to <\xc2\xa060 and \xe2\x89\xa5\xc2\xa060\xc2\xa0cm dbh, respectively) did not. Overall, forest interior species richness and abundance increased significantly with increasing patch size but edge species richness did not. Species richness and abundance of shade-tolerant and shade-demanding tree species also increased with increasing patch size. The abundance of zoochory dispersed tree species was significantly related to increasing patch size, but those dispersed by autochory did not display any clear relationship between patch size and species richness or abundance. Our findings suggest that with increasing forest patch area, tree compositional patterns may be driven by species specific shade-tolerance adaptations and dispersal patterns. Differential responses in these traits by the plant community within the individual habitat zones of forest edge and interiors likely plays a major role in determining the inherent plant community and thus the subsequent ecological processes of forest patches, including their responses to increasing patch area.'

Abstract: 'We examined the response of forest tree species with different dispersal modes to anthropogenic pressure in a dry deciduous forest of South India. The species and their populations were sampled in two forest stands, one in proximity to a Soliga settlement (greater disturbance) and the other distant to the settlement (lower disturbance). Our results suggest that the populations of animal dispersed species than those of wind or passively dispersed species are more vulnerable to human disturbance. In fact wind dispersed species seem to be facilitated by human disturbances. The proximal site had a higher representation of understory plants and seedling belonging to wind dispersed species than that of animal dispersed species. We discuss the results in the context of the role of dispersal mode in shaping species response, and vegetation composition of forest to anthropogenic pressures.'

Abstract: 'Morphometric analysis of six sub-watersheds (Chandni Nalla, Tawa River, Gunjari Nalla, Gadaria Nalla, Kaliyadeh River and Bhagner River) in the central zone of the Narmada River basin was carried out using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques. The morphometric parameters of the sub-watersheds are classified under linear, aerial and relief aspects. Morphometric analysis has been carried out using GIS software-ERDAS Imagine (V 8.7) and Arc GIS (V 9.0). Drainage network in the study area shows dendritic pattern. Dendritic pattern, in general is considered as a group of resequent streams within homogenous lithology and gently sloping topography. Stream orders range from first to sixth order. Results obtained from the morphometric analysis show that all sub-watersheds have very coarse to coarse drainage texture and fall under normal basin category, while the elongation ratio (Re) shows that Chandni sub-watershed is circular in shape and the remaining sub-watersheds are elongated.'

Abstract: 'Climate change is one of the most important global environmental challenges, which affects the entire earth system in terms of negative impacts on food production, water supply, health, livelihood, energy, etc. The intent of the present study was to assess the impact of climate change on the water balance components of a data-starved Upper Baitarani River basin of Eastern India using ArcSWAT model. The ArcSWAT model was calibrated using SUFI-2 technique. The daily observed streamflow data from 1998 to 2003 were employed for calibration and those for 2004\xe2\x80\x932005 for validation. The calibration results were found to be satisfactory with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.88 and 9.70\xc2\xa0m3/s for the daily time step, respectively. Also, the model was validated successfully for simulating daily streamflow (NSE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.80 and MAE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8910.33\xc2\xa0m3/s). The calibrated and validated model was then used to evaluate basin response to the anticipated climate changes by the end of the 21st century. Twelve independent as well as twenty eight combined area-specific climatic scenarios were considered in this study to evaluate the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the basin. The analysis of model results for the 12 Independent Climatic Scenarios indicated a reduction in the surface runoff ranging from 2.5 to 11\xc2\xa0% by changing the temperature from 1 to 5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, whereas the increase in rainfall by 2.5 to 15\xc2\xa0% suggested an increase in surface runoff by 6.67 to 43.42\xc2\xa0% from the baseline condition. In case of 28 Combined Scenarios compared to the baseline condition, the changes in surface runoff would vary from \xe2\x88\x924.55 to 37.53\xc2\xa0%, the groundwater recharge would change from \xe2\x88\x928.7 to 23.15\xc2\xa0% and the evapotranspiration would increase from 4.05 to 11.88\xc2\xa0%. It is concluded that future changes in the climatic condition by the end of the 21st century are most likely to produce significant impacts on the streamflow in the study area. The findings of this study and those of follow-up studies in this direction will be useful for guiding suitable adaptation measures for sustainable water management in the basin in the face of impending climate change.'

Abstract: 'The genetic variation of local subpopulations (Palni hills, India) of the blackfly Simulium gravelyi was surveyed at different altitudinal locations using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. By comparing the similarity of the bands produced by RAPDs, it may be concluded that there is variation within this population. These data suggest that the heterogeneity of band pattern of S. gravelyi steadily increased from low elevation to high elevation. Site 5 (1590 m altitude) was more polymorphic and it differed most from site 1 (290 m). This is established by the ecological diversity and statistical analyses (PCA) and predicting two major ecological factors of conductivity and current velocity. The speciation hypothesis is consistent with the molecular evidence, postulates a high elevational site 5 (1590 m) and a subsequent site 4 (1250 m).'

Abstract: ' Swertia is ethno-medicinally an important genus belonging to family Gentianaceae. Swertia chirayita is used as imperative medicinal plant in Indian system of medicine. However, this species has been frequently adulterated due to its high demand and scarcity. Authentication of this species was needed to protect consumers and conservation measures and to find out the alternative source. Deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) extracted from fifteen samples of six species belonging to different localities, were used as templates. Four candidate barcodes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis was executed by Z-Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing v.3. Sequenced products were analyzed on automated applied biosystems 3730XI analyzer. Identification was performed by using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis 5 software (version 5.1). The amplification efficiency of all DNA barcodes [megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase (matK), ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), photosystem II protein D1- stuctural RNA- His tRNA (psbA-trnH) and internal transcribed spacer region (ITS)] was 100\xc2\xa0%. Here, the highest interspecific divergence provided by ITS is 11.87\xc2\xa0% and intraspecific by psbA-trnH being 10.22\xc2\xa0% as compared to matK (5.04\xc2\xa0%) and rbcL (0.99\xc2\xa0%). ITS region proves robust molecular marker for differing the S. chirayita from its related adulterant species. All barcoding regions indicate that S. chirayita and S. minor both are more closely related than other Swertia species. Findings showed that DNA barcoding is an efficient tool for identification and authentication of S. chirayita. Use of S. minor as substitute to S. chirayita can be advocated.'

Abstract: 'Ecotourism potentially provides a sustainable approach to tourism development in national parks. The paper focuses on ecotourism impacts and the status of wildlife within the Rajiv Gandhi National Park (Nagarhole) situated in Karnataka. It explores a multitude of interactions that exist among wildlife, conservation efforts, socio-economic, and relocation attempts of the tribal people in the park. Field exploration was undertaken to identify the impacts of ecotourism. The results revealed the ongoing effort by the government to relocate the tribal people within the park and the difficulty faced by park officials to cope with the numerous impacts and conservation strategies in the park. The tourists were engaged in different ecotourism activities and made an observation on the lack of educational awareness and biophysical impacts such as littering and vegetation damage. This paper will contribute a greater understanding of the impacts of ecotourism management for sustainability of the national park.'

Title: 'Phytosociology, structure and dynamics of Pinus roxburghii associations from Northern Pakistan'

Abstract: 'We investigated the phytosociology, structure and dynamics of Pinus roxburghii in 40 stands in northern areas of Pakistan by using cluster analysis (Ward\xe2\x80\x99s agglomerative clustering) and ordination (Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling). Cluster analysis revealed three major groups associated with specific environmental characteristics: (1) P. roxburghii (2) Pinus-Quercus baloot and (3) Pinus-Olea ferruginea community types. NMS-ordination showed the major gradient as an amalgam of elevation (r 2 = 0.441, p <0.01) and slope (r 2 = 0.391, p <0.05) as the two topographic factors correlated with species distribution. The first ordination axis also showed positive correlation with soil variables like pH and electrical conductivity, suggesting that soil chemistry was related to topographic characteristics and probably acted as a secondary gradient. We also examined size class distributions, age structures and growth rates of the three communities in order to describe community development and dynamics. Total tree density was 14700 plants/ha, with P. roxburghii having a relative density of 82% to 100%. Density of juvenile and total density and basal area of the subordinate tree species were low. The low density of trees in the smallest diameter size-class suggested that the recruitment of small P. roxburghii plants into the adult population may be lower than the required replacement rate for the stands. Pooled size-class distributions for the species showed a multimodal pattern with some regeneration gaps. Browsing, heavy logging and other anthropogenic activities were the overriding factors responsible for the poor recruitment of P. roxburghii. We concluded from the age structure that the forests were characterized by the dominance of young trees. Growth rate analysis revealed that P. roxburghii was the fastest growing species among the conifers species in Pakistan. In view of its relatively fast growth and longevity, P. roxburghii seems to be a suitable choice for short-term cultural practices in order to enhance wood production in lesser Himalaya and Hindukush ranges of Pakistan.'

Abstract: 'Land use/land cover change dynamics along the estuarine complex of Mandovi\xe2\x80\x93Zuari in the coastal state of Goa, India is studied by the application of multi-temporal remote sensing data. This tropical estuarine region has faced significant changes in the last few decades due to diverse pressures from various sectors, mainly of anthropogenic origin. Spatial and temporal changes in the LU/LC classes have been evaluated using satellite datasets from Landsat MSS, TM and IRS-LISS III for the years 1973, 1989, 2001 and 2011. Considering a spectrally heterogeneous landscape of the region, the LU/LC changes are identified by using principal component analysis (PCA) as a pre-classification step, followed by the implementation of a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification called hybrid classification. The application of PCA has proved to be suitable to successfully identify discrete land surface classes for this study area. An overall accuracy of 95.56\xc2\xa0% (kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.9556), 92.93\xc2\xa0% (kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.92), 84.64\xc2\xa0% (kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.85) and 86.36\xc2\xa0% (kappa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.85) has been obtained for the year 2011, 2001, 1989 and 1973, respectively. The study reveals a gradual increase in built-up area due to urbanization corresponding to a decrease in agricultural land and a considerable loss in beach area. Changes in the mangroves are also assessed within this extent as Goa has significant pockets of mangroves which are located mainly along the estuarine complexes of Mandovi and Zuari (along with the Cumbarjua canal complex). The results highlight an increase in mangrove coverage within the study extent by 1,585.8\xc2\xa0ha from 1973 to 2011. The mangrove areal extent along Mandovi has increased from 149.45 to 1,059.77\xc2\xa0ha and from 142.95 to 676.12\xc2\xa0ha along Zuari (including Cumbarjua canal). Increasing awareness and the steps taken by the forest department to provide suitable environment for the growth of mangroves are the main reasons for this increment.'

Abstract: 'Apex predators fulfil potentially vital ecological roles. Typically wide-ranging and charismatic, they can also be useful surrogates for biodiversity preservation, making their targeted conservation imperative. The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), an endangered, endemic sub-species, is the island\xe2\x80\x99s apex predator. Of potential keystone importance, this carnivore also fulfills \xe2\x80\x9cumbrella\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cflagship\xe2\x80\x9d criterion and is of high ecological and existence value. Apex predator conservation requires identifying factors underlying distribution, so we used multi-scale maximum entropy modelling with sampling bias correction to investigate a broad suite of relevant ecological, climatic and anthropogenic factors in order to identify potentially suitable leopard habitat. Presence locations were determined from 15\xc2\xa0years of surveys, observations and verified reports. The best bias correction procedure and scale were uncertain, so we employed a novel method of using information from all models across analyses to determine top models and identify influential variables. Leopard presence was most strongly linked to the landscape proportion encompassed by Protected Areas strictly limiting human presence, with more porous Protected Areas less influential. All three forest composition and configuration metrics investigated (area weighted mean patch size, patch density and forest connectivity) were influential, with increased patch size and higher connectivity predicting better habitat suitability for leopards. Habitat suitability was also better where cropland extent and urban patch size were small. In summary, ground-level protection and natural forest extent and connectivity are of profound importance to Sri Lankan leopard distribution and are key factors in ensuring the ecological integrity of the island\xe2\x80\x99s faunal assemblages.'

Abstract: 'Tree species richness, tree density, basal area, population structure and distribution pattern were investigated in undisturbed, mildly disturbed, moderately disturbed and highly disturbed stands of tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh. The forest stands were selected based on the disturbance index (the basal area of the cut trees measured at ground level expressed as a fraction of the total basal area of all trees including felled ones): (i) undisturbed stand (0% disturbance index), (ii) mildly disturbed (20% disturbance index), (iii) moderately disturbed (40% disturbance index), and (iv) highly disturbed stand (70% disturbance index). Tree species richness varied along the disturbance gradient in different stands. The mildly disturbed stand showed the highest species richness (54 of 51 genera). Species richness was lowest (16 of 16 genera) in the highly disturbed stand. In the undisturbed stand, 47 species of 42 genera were recorded while in the moderately disturbed stand 42 species of 36 genera were found. The Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener diversity index for tree species ranged from 0.7 to 2.02 in all the stands. The highest tree diversity was recorded in the undisturbed stand and the lowest in the highly disturbed stand. The stands differed with respect to the tree species composition at the family and generic level. Fagaceae, Dipterocarpaceae and Clusiaceae dominated over other families and contributed 53% in the undisturbed, 51% in the mildly disturbed, 42% in the moderately disturbed and 49% in the highly disturbed forest stands to the total density of the respective stand. Stand density was highest (5452 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921) in the undisturbed stand, followed by the mildly disturbed stand (5014), intermediate (3656) in the moderately disturbed stand and lowest (338) in the highly disturbed stand. Dominance, calculated as the importance value index of different species, varied greatly across the stands. The highest stand density and species richness were represented in the medium girth class (51\xe2\x80\x93110 cm) in all the stands. In the undisturbed stand, the highest density was found in the 111\xe2\x80\x93140 cm girth class, while in the mildly disturbed stand the 51\xe2\x80\x9380 cm girth range recorded the highest density. About 55, 68 and 52% species were found to be regenerating in the undisturbed, mildly disturbed and moderately disturbed stands, respectively. No regeneration was recorded in the highly disturbed stand. Variation in species richness, distribution pattern and regeneration potential is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'For sustainable development in a river basin, it is crucial to understand population growth\xe2\x80\x93land use/land cover (LU/LC) transformations\xe2\x80\x93water quality nexus. This study investigates the effects of demographic changes and LU/LC transformations on surface water quality of rural (Ghod) and urban (Mula-Mutha) subbasins of Upper Bhima River basin. Population data (1981\xe2\x80\x932011) and LU/LC data {October 2002 [Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data] and October/November 2009 (Indian Remote Sensing 1C Linear Imaging Self Scanner III data]} were analysed using statistical, remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to study demographic and LU/LC changes, respectively. Further, overall indices of pollution (OIPs) developed specifically for rural subbasin (OIPr: Hardness CaCO3 and Total Dissolved Solids), urban subbasin (OIPu: Biological Oxygen Demand, Chlorides, Coliform Total, Colour, Dissolved Oxygen%, pH and Turbidity) and single OIP considering all parameters (OIPa) were used for spatio-temporal water quality assessment of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Results revealed that from 1981 to 2011, population increase was higher in urban subbasin than in rural subbasin. Subsequently, from 2002 to 2009 mainly increase in built-up lands (3.82%) and agricultural lands (15.35%) in urban and rural subbasins respectively, affected their water quality. From 2002 to 2009, the highest increase in OIPr and OIPu was observed at Kashti (3.37\xe2\x80\x936.52 due to fertilizers) and Bundgarden Bridge (3.03\xe2\x80\x937.83 due to municipal and industrial wastes) stations of rural and urban subbasins, respectively. With significant increase in OIPa of 2.74\xe2\x80\x936.70, Bundgarden Bridge station affected by urbanization had the most polluted water quality.'

Abstract: 'The plant resources form an integral part of a huge inter-dependent system that encompasses the physical components and the biological community of life. These resources have enormous prospective benefits to humankind. The ever-increasing population and climate change over the years have contributed substantially to the pressure on plant resources leading to their decline or loss in nature. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop suitable conservation strategies for proper utilization and sustainability of these important resources.'

Title: 'A Statistical appraisal to hydrogeochemistry of fluoride contaminated ground water in Nayagarh district, Odisha'

Abstract: 'Seasonal variation of ground water in Nayagarh district, Odisha is determined by analysing both pre and post monsoon water samples. The high fluoride content is an endemic problem in the area and special attention was attached to the point. The chemical compositions of the ground water of the area are dominated by CaCl, NaCl and mixed CaMgCl types in pre-monsoon and CaHCO3-mixed CaMgCl type in post-monsoon. This is largely due to chemical weathering of Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt rock types. Increasing alkalinity vis-a-vis F concentration in pre-monsoon is associated with sodium-bicarbonate water types having high pH (>7) and low calcium and magnesium contents. The percentage of total high fluoride containing water samples is nearly double in pre-monsoon than in post-monsoon. During both the seasons, pH values indicate mildly alkaline to weakly acidic nature of the water samples. Fluoride concentration has good correlation with pH in pre-monsoon whereas in post-monsoon it shows good correlation with Fe. Facies analysis indicates that water is becoming predominantly Ca-Na cation and Cl-SO4-HCO3 anion type in premonsoon than Ca-Mg type and HCO3-Cl-SO4 type in post-monsoon. The seasonal variations in concentrations of anthropogenic components demonstrate that the groundwater system is very less liable to pollution by human activities.'

Abstract: 'Zygotic embryos excised from immature green fruits of the rattan palm, Calamus thwaitesii and cultured for 16\xc2\xa0weeks under optimum culture conditions in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 31.67\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 35.23\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) produced mixed (compact and friable) calli at 70 and 92\xc2\xa0% rates. The semi-friable part of the callus (~500\xc2\xa0mg) separated and subcultured in medium containing 2.22\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM 6-benzyladenine and 1.07\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid produced groups of 10.37\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.60\xe2\x80\x9321.52\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.48 discrete globular embryoids of varied size in 6\xe2\x80\x938\xc2\xa0weeks. Calli raised in presence of 2,4,5-T were relatively more prolific, friable and embryogenic than those induced by 2,4-D. Embryoids (2.0\xe2\x80\x933.0\xc2\xa0mm) isolated and cultured in basal medium germinated into plantlets at 65\xc2\xa0% efficiency while the immature (0.5\xe2\x80\x932.0\xc2\xa0mm) ones produced calloid structures. Approximately 15\xc2\xa0% of the in vitro plantlets raised from the 2,4-D-induced embryogenic calli produced secondary immature embryoids on the sheath and lamina parts of leaves which were isolated and cultured in basal medium developed into rooted plantlets at 62\xc2\xa0% rate in 12\xe2\x80\x9316\xc2\xa0weeks. The continued growth of the embryo-derived callus through successive subcultures together with differentiation of embryoids into plantlets, and the formation of immature embryoids on in vitro plantlets in MS basal nutrient medium reports for the first time a reliable method of producing at least 116 plants from a single embryo in a year. Rooted plantlets treated with 50\xc2\xa0% glycerin survived at 78\xc2\xa0% rate after hardening and 82.7\xc2\xa0% of the hardened plants reintroduced into forest segments showed uniform growth free of morphological abnormalities after 3\xc2\xa0years of observation. In addition to embryogenesis, cryopreservation of the zygotic embryos through simple drying and encapsulation\xe2\x80\x93dehydration methods resulting 60\xe2\x80\x9370\xc2\xa0% recovery rates also offers another option for long-term conservation and sustainable utilization of this plant genetic resource.'

Abstract: 'India is one of the most flood-prone countries in the world after Bangladesh and these are quite common throughout the country. However, their characteristics differ from region to region. Flooding behavior and their management at national level have been investigated in this article. Floods are caused mainly due to the extreme spatial and temporal variation in the quantity of rainfall and meteorological conditions during monsoon season (June\xe2\x80\x93September). About 80% of the total annual rainfall is concentrated during the period, resulting in a very high discharge from rivers, causing extensive damage to life and property. The National Flood Control Program has been launched in the country in the year 1954. Since then, sizeable progress has been made in structural and non-structural flood protection measures. Structural measures involve the construction of physical structures like embankments, dams, drainage channels, and reservoirs that prevent flood waters from reaching potential damage centers, whereas non-structural measures like flood forecasting aim at improving the preparedness to floods by keeping people away from flood waters. Institutional and legal setup to mitigate the impacts of floods has evolved over the years. Nevertheless, statistics do not reveal major reduction in the flood damages. However, river-friendly and less-interventionist approaches have been suggested to achieve sustainable flood management.'

Abstract: 'In recent years, the use of remotely sensed data and Geographic Information System (GIS) applications has been found increasing in a wide range of resources inventory, mapping, analysis, monitoring and environmental management. Remote sensing data provides an opportunity for better observation and systematic analysis of terrain conditions following the synoptic and multi-spectral coverage. In the present study, the geomorphological analysis reveals that various denudational and depositional landforms have been analysed and mapped. The soil depth ranges from extremely shallow in isolated mounds to very deep in the pediplains. Based on the slope gradient, morphometry, soil depth, vegetation cover and image characteristics of standard FCC imagery of IRS-1D LISS-III data, four categories of eroded lands i.e., very severe, severe, moderate and nil to slight have been identified and mapped. The integrated analysis of slope, geomorphology and degraded lands layers in GIS revealed that the pediplains, rolling plains and subdued plateau are associated with very severe land degradation and accounts for 6.05%, 3.85% and 3.47% of total area respectively. The analysis of percentage of degraded lands at geomorphic sub unit level indicates that severe land degradation process is dominant in the dissected ridges, isolated mounds, escarpments and plateau spurs. The remote sensing data and GIS based detailed geomorphological and degraded lands analysis ensure better understanding of landform-eroded lands relationship and distribution to assess the status of land degradation at micro geomorphic unit for reclamation, geo-environmental planning and management. Similar study also helps in the areas of natural resource management, environmental planning and management, watershed management and hazards monitoring and mitigation.'

Abstract: 'This study examines the spatial and temporal forest cover changes in Swat and Shangla districts to understand the deforestation pattern in context of the recent security conflict in these districts. We used multi-resolution satellite images to assess the long term deforestation from 2001 to2009 and also to identify episodic forest cutting areas appeared during the conflict period of Oct. 2007\xe2\x80\x93Oct. 2008. There are only 58 ha of deforestation identified during the conflict period while 1268 ha of gross annual deforestation were assessed during last eight years. Most of the deforestation patches persist around the administrative boundaries at sub-district levels (tehsils) which can be attributed to ambiguity in unclear jurisdiction between the forest official. The results highlight that the forest cutting appeared in Swat and Shangla during the conflict period is not as significant when compared with the long term deforestation pattern in the area. On the one side the results of the study are supportive to the picture that emerges from international studies which report high rate of deforestation in the country and on the other side it negates any relation between the security situation and the increasing deforestation in the north western Pakistan. The study concludes that deforestation assessments require verification by independent sources of data, such as satellite imagery to improve our understanding of deforestation processes.'

Abstract: 'Chilika Lake, the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia, is a prominent biodiversity hotspot along the Indian east coast. The geomorphology, water quality and biological productivity of the lake had undergone significant changes over the years under the influence of natural events and anthropogenic interventions. Decades of research have shown that the ecological changes of the lake system and its fisheries were influenced mainly by the water exchange between the lake and the sea that controls the salinity, siltation, macrophyte infestation and recruitment of marine forms. Depletion of fisheries and loss of biodiversity in 1980s and 1990s have been linked to the northward shifting of lake\xe2\x80\x99s inlet and silting up of the outer channel. In order to improve the health of the lagoon and restoration of its biodiversity, a new mouth was dredged open in September 2000. Opening of the new mouth has resulted in some improvements with substantial increase in capture fishery, reduction in weed infestation, growth of seagrasses, appearance of dolphins and increase in the population of migratory birds. But, many stake holders claim that the problems associated with the lake ecology and its contribution to the socio-economic development of the stake holders still persist which could escalate in future.'

Abstract: 'Plant diversity plays key ecological roles in forest ecosystems, including influencing succession, resilience and nutrient cycling. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of livestock grazing and human uses on herbaceous species diversity. We surveyed 50 ha of protected area and 50 ha of unprotected area to evaluate herbaceous species diversity in oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forests in northern Iran. We calculated and compared three indices each of diversity and evenness, and species richness between the two areas. Herbaceous cover was higher in the unprotected area while leaf litter depth and tree canopy cover were higher in the protected area. The diversity indices, H (Shannon-Wiener index), N1 (McArthur index), N2 (Hill\xe2\x80\x99s index), EQ (Modified Nee index), Evar (Smith-Wilson index), E5 (modified index of Hill) and R=S (species richness) and species richness R=S were greater in the protected area than in the unprotected area, suggesting that protection from grazing results in increased numbers of plants and species. The effect of land protection on plant diversity was more pronounced for evenness than for species richness and the positive correlation between diversity and evenness indices was higher than that between diversity and richness.'

Abstract: 'Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and their mycorrhizae were studied in winter rainfall areas of western South Africa. The species composition, spore numbers, and mycorrhization were attempted to correlate with various abiotic factors. Mycorrhization of grasses was significantly correlated with pH and spore numbers and negatively correlated with electric conductivity, total N-content, and total P-content of the soils. Spore numbers were negatively correlated with electric conductivity and total N-content.'

Abstract: 'Different human societies have different biodiversity around them; there is diversity in their food habits, ailments, occupations, daily routine, social customs, needs, and notions about natural phenomena. They have different domestic animals, and consequently, different veterinary diseases to manage. These circumstances have given rise to very diverse experiences among indigenous societies about plant wealth around them. Over generations, this has made very rich additions to the interrelationships between man and plant wealth around him. Faith, tradition, taboos and several such associations with forests and particular plant species have helped in conservation of plant diversity. The richness of plant diversity in any area, is not evaluated merely by the number of species occurring there, but by the intensity of associations and dependence of the indigenous communities on that plant wealth. Respect for this indigenous knowledge, and relationship helps in conservation.'

Abstract: 'It is generally considered difficult to resolve negative unidirectional externalities within hydro-hegemonic basins in which the upstream powerful riparian has the incentive to unilaterally develop the river without regard to downstream consequences. Weaker downstream riparian states can resort to issue linkages and side payments to coerce a change in the upstream hydro-hegemon\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, but the success of these tools depends on the specific political and economic situation in the basin and on the preferences of the hydro-hegemonic state for cooperation. Neglected in the literature is another possibility. Through a consideration of the sanctioned discourse of watershed management at the domestic levels, this article shows that domestic environmental non-governmental organizations and policy entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x94through the application of a range of tools\xe2\x80\x94can work to change the domestic water management discourse from a state-hydraulic paradigm to a more sustainable water management paradigm. When these efforts are successful, we can find that these non-state actors can perform a crucial function in cleaning up domestic stretches of international rivers, which produces positive externalities downstream. In the process, they are able of achieving what often years of international negotiations failed to accomplish. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, India\xe2\x80\x99s policies on water quality in the national stretches of Ganges Basin and China\xe2\x80\x99s policies on biodiversity in the national stretches of the Mekong Basin are used to make this argument.'

Abstract: 'Surface water samples from Godavari river basin was analyzed quantitatively for the concentration of eight heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, \n copper, iron, lead, nickel and zinc using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The analyzed data revealed that iron and zinc metals were found to be the most abundant metals in the river Godavari and its tributaries. Iron (Fe) recorded the highest, while cadmium (Cd) had the least concentration. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, iron and zinc metals are within the acceptable limit of BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) 1050 (2012) Specification for drinking water, pp 1\xe2\x80\x935). The analysis of Godavari river and its tributary\xe2\x80\x99s water samples reveals that the water is contaminated at selected points which are not suitable for drinking. Nickel and Copper concentration is above acceptable limit and other metal concentration is within the acceptable limit. Comprehensive study of the results reveals that out of 18 water quality stations monitored, water samples collected at 7 water quality stations are found to be within the permissible limit for all purposes. While Rajegaon, Tekra, Nandgaon, P. G. Bridge, Bhatpalli, Kumhari, Pauni, Hivra, Ashti, Bamini, and Jagda stations were beyond the desirable limit due to presence of copper and nickel metals. The contents of copper metal ions were higher at some water quality stations on Wunna river (Nandgaon); Wardha river (Hivra) and Wainganga river (Kumhari, Pauni, Ashti) during Feb. 2012, while nickel concentration during Feb. 2012, June 2012, March 2013 and Aug. 2013 at some water quality stations on rivers Bagh, Indravati, Pranhita, Wunna, Penganga, Peddavagu, Wainganga and Wardha. It can be concluded that rapid population growth and industrialization have brought about resource degradation and a decline in environmental quality.'

Abstract: ' Aconitum balfourii (Bruhl) Muk. (Ranunculaceae) is an endangered medicinal plant. Natural populations were surveyed in the northwest Himalaya for population estimation and evaluation of elite germplasm. Vegetation sampling of quadrats was conducted using the vertical belt transect method in areas supporting A. balfourii. Plant density and relative dominance of A. balfourii were low compared with other alpine species. Threat status was determined on a site-by-site basis as well as for entire western Himalaya. A. balfourii was generally classified as endangered on the basis of geographic distribution and critically endangered on the basis of abundance. We found the natural geographic distribution of A. balfourii to be diminishing due to habitat destruction. Immediate corrective management measures are needed for sustainable utilization and long-term conservation of the species in the wild.'

Abstract: 'Non-timber forest products (NTFP) such as fuelwood, fodder, fruit, medicinal plants, and small timber are important to the rural poor in India. The traditional usufruct rights that the poor enjoyed have been gradually eroded by state control. This process has accelerated with increases in the prices of timber and industrial wood products. Non-timber forest products collected by the poor do not enter the system of national accounts, which results in the undervaluation of the forest wealth of the country. According to some estimates, the total demand for these products outstrips the sustainable yield of the forests in India. To ensure the best use of the forests, it is necessary for rural communities to share the responsibility of forest management with the forest departments. A proposed joint forestry project in South India is discussed as a case study of this innovative approach to forest management. Data on the existing patterns of NTFP extraction are presented to gain a better understanding of the role that these products play in the life of the rural poor. Policies from the case study are discussed in the concluding section.'

Abstract: 'India is a vast country and is highly diversified in terms of natural resources and socio-economic setup. Moreover, its water resources are unevenly distributed in space and time. With increasing population and increasing aspiration for improved standard of living, there is an acute pressure on the demand and availability of water. Though the idea of interlinking of rivers is not a new concept in India, it had rather persisted long back as much as in other countries of ancient civilization. National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has given the real shape to the proposal of the interlinking of rivers of the country. In India the river-linking project in a sensible and scientific manner will not only allow the prevention of the colossal wastage of a vitally important natural resource, mitigate the flood and inundation by detaining flowing surface water of rainy seasons, but also ensure availability of water to drier areas; combating both flood and drought simultaneously. Moreover, this project will generate 34,000\xc2\xa0MW of hydropower and irrigation of an additional 35\xc2\xa0million hectares (135,135\xc2\xa0square miles) of land. Though linking of rivers may initially appear to be a costly proposition in ecological, geological, hydrological and economical terms, in the long run the net benefits coming from it will far outweigh these costs or losses. However, in the absence of any definite international legal framework, Bangladesh has raised objections against the project. This paper aims at looking at this long-term plan, the project proposal, its involvement and impact not only on the states of India, India as a whole, but also on its neighbouring nations which are linked with India through the waterways, and share the common climatic conditions and economic status.'

Abstract: 'We examine the dynamics and spatial determinants of land change in India by integrating decadal land cover maps (1985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005) from a wall-to-wall analysis of Landsat images with spatiotemporal socioeconomic database for ~630,000 villages in India. We reinforce our results through collective evidence from synthesis of 102 case studies that incorporate field knowledge of the causes of land change in India. We focus on cropland\xe2\x80\x93fallow land conversions, and forest area changes (excludes non-forest tree categories including commercial plantations). We show that cropland to fallow conversions are prominently associated with lack of irrigation and capital, male agricultural labor shortage, and fragmentation of land holdings. We find gross forest loss is substantial and increased from ~23,810\xc2\xa0km2 (1985\xe2\x80\x931995) to ~25,770\xc2\xa0km2 (1995\xe2\x80\x932005). The gross forest gain also increased from ~6000\xc2\xa0km2 (1985\xe2\x80\x931995) to ~7440\xc2\xa0km2 (1995\xe2\x80\x932005). Overall, India experienced a net decline in forest by ~18,000\xc2\xa0km2 (gross loss\xe2\x80\x93gross gain) consistently during both decades. We show that the major source of forest loss was cropland expansion in areas of low cropland productivity (due to soil degradation and lack of irrigation), followed by industrial development and mining/quarrying activities, and excessive economic dependence of villages on forest resources.'

Abstract: 'A cascade of reviews and growing body of literature exists on forest invasion ecology, its mechanism or causes; however, no review addressed the sustainable management of invasive plants of forest in totality. Henceforth, the present paper aims to provide a critical review on the management of invasive species particularly in the context of forest plants. Plant invasion in forest is now increasingly being recognized as a global problem, and various continents are adversely affected, although to a differential scale. Quest for the ecological mechanism lying behind the success of invasive species over native species of forest has drawn the attention of researches worldwide particularly in the context of diversity\xe2\x80\x93stability relationship. Transport, colonization, establishment, and landscape spread may be different steps in success of invasive plants in forest, and each and every step is checked through several ecological attributes. Further, several ecological attribute and hypothesis (enemy release, novel weapon, empty niche, evolution of increased competitive ability, etc.) were proposed pertaining to success of invasive plant species in forest ecosystems. However, a single theory will not be able to account for invasion success among all environments as it may vary spatially and temporally. Therefore, in order to formulate a sustainable management plan for invasive plants of forest, it is necessary to develop a synoptic view of the dynamic processes involved in the invasion process. Moreover, invasive species of forest can act synergistically with other elements of global change, including land-use change, climate change, increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nitrogen deposition. Henceforth, a unified framework for biological invasions that reconciles and integrates the key features of the most commonly used invasion frameworks into a single conceptual model that can be applied to all human-mediated invasions.'

Abstract: 'A number of wild plants, used by rural and tribal populations and contributing significantly to their livelihood and food security have escaped recognition and scientific inquiry. Their distribution, conservation, mode of harvest by locals and optimal use require region-specific assessment in order to integrate them into developmental interventions. This study analyzed the collection, consumption, sale and income from edible forest fruits in 49 tribal villages spread over five districts of Orissa State in eastern India. Density, dominance and diversity of species yielding wild fruit were measured by studying ecological parameters in the sample plots. We estimated an average of 48 fruit plants per hectare of deciduous forests. Fifty-six wild edible fruit species belonging to 40 genera in 26 families were recorded in the study region, many of which have multiple uses. Indigenous fruits formed part of the family diet with average annual consumption of 73\xc2\xa0kg per household. Sale of wild fruits contributed 15\xc2\xa0% of income for tribal households. Despite their good knowledge of indigenous fruits, the tribal populations have not adopted fruit tree farming which would enhance their nutrition and income.'

Abstract: 'The present study aims to investigate the impact of climate change on water availability and hydrological extremes in the Krishna River basin, the second largest eastward draining river of Peninsular India. The hydrological response of the basin for the past observed climatic data (1985\xe2\x80\x932005) and future climatic scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, for 2006\xe2\x80\x932099) is simulated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The soil, vegetation, topographic, and meteorological inputs for the model are derived from remote sensing and field-observed data. The model calibration is performed using observed discharge data at 4 gauging stations for the time period of 21\xc2\xa0years (1985\xe2\x80\x932005); the coefficients of determination (R2) are in the range of 0.81\xe2\x80\x930.95. The model validation is carried out at the Vijayawada station (R2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.82), near the basin outlet. The meteorological forcing consisting of future climatic inputs for the entire century (2006\xe2\x80\x932099) for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios extracted from IITMRegCM4-4 predictions are used to simulate the future hydrological regime of the basin. The hydrological response analysis shows increase in annual discharge by 13.8 and 27.8\xc2\xa0cumec under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The hydrological extreme events are also found to increase under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios as compared with the past records of 1985\xe2\x80\x932005. The peak discharge is observed to increase in the range of 57.7\xe2\x80\x9376.8 and 68.5\xe2\x80\x9377.5% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The study highlights that the annual water potential and hydrological extremes in the Krishna basin will increase under the future climatic scenarios.'

Abstract: 'The present study describes the plant propagation via indirect organogenesis from in vitro derived leaf and internode explants of Plectranthus bourneae, an endemic plant to south India. Leaf and internodal explants successfully callused on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) supplemented with different concentrations of auxins [2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), NAA (\xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid), IAA (indole-3 acetic acid), IBA (indole-3-butyric acid) and PIC (Picloram); 0.1\xe2\x80\x932.0\xc2\xa0mg/l] in combination with BA (6-benzyladenine) (0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l). Maximum callus induction (98\xc2\xa0%) was achieved from leaf explant followed by internodal explant (89\xc2\xa0%) at 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/l NAA, 0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l BA. Leaf derived callus showed better shoot regeneration (29.71 shoots) on MS medium containing 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/l KN (kinetin), 0.7\xc2\xa0mg/l NAA, and 50\xc2\xa0mg/l CH (casein hydrolysate) followed by internodal callus (19.71). A maximum of 19.14 roots/shoot was observed at 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/l IBA. The rooted plantlets were successfully hardened and transferred to greenhouse condition with 80\xc2\xa0% survival. This system could be utilized for large-scale multiplication of P. bourneae by tissue culture.'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry systems have been recognized as areas with high conservation potential, and there is a need to quickly assess the biodiversity and tree stocking density available in these systems. However, it is not clear if the commonly used fixed area plot is most efficient for sampling such landscapes, or if a different method could provide equivalent data with less effort. Thus, a field and simulation-based study was carried out to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area transect versus the fixed area square plot. Field efficiency tests were carried out in three habitat types, robusta coffee plantations, arabica coffee plantations and a privately owned forest fragment, in Kodagu, southern India. A simulation study of bias, precision and accuracy of the two methods for tree density estimation also was carried out using various spatial distribution patterns and densities. The variable area transect was significantly more efficient per unit effort in the field than the fixed area square plot. In the simulation tests both methods performed equally well under random spatial distribution. However, under simulated aggregated distribution both methods were positively biased (square plot up to 12% at low density, variable area transect 9\xe2\x80\x9312% at all densities), and under simulated regular distribution the variable area transect was slightly negatively biased (\xe2\x88\x925 to \xe2\x88\x927% at medium to high density). The variable area transect thus can be recommended over the square plot for rapid assessment of tree diversity and density, when the vegetation is expected to be randomly dispersed.'

Abstract: 'Qualitative reproductive traits of 84 plant species belonging to 41 families were studied in tropical dry evergreen forest on the Coromandel coast of India. Majority of species had rotate type, white-coloured, scented flowers, rewarding nectar and pollen and pollinated chiefly by bees. An association between floral traits and pollination spectrum is evident. Bee pollination was prevalent in pollination systems. Among the fruit types, drupe and berry were common in black and red colour respectively, and dispersed by zoochorous mode. Seeds of brown- and green-coloured dry fruits, without any reward were disseminated by wind and explosion. The reproductive phenophase of trees and lianas occurred mostly during the dry period from January to June, which receives rainfall of less than 50\xc2\xa0mm a month. However, shrubs showed a peak in flowering and fruiting in wet period. Detailed phenological observations of 22 woody species revealed a seasonal and unimodal pattern in flowering. Although some species were in flower round the year, flowering activity was skewed towards the dry season. The fruiting activity showed a bimodal pattern, one peak in dry season and another in wet season. Many species displayed a temporal aggregation in flowering and fruiting. The significant relation was obtained between reproductive traits and phenology of plants in the tropical dry evergreen forest.'

Abstract: ' Macrobrachium rosenbergii is an aquaculture species of global importance whose production has sharply declined since 2005. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcribed sequences are likely to have high association with economic traits and are important for marker assisted selection. SNPs were mined in 34 reported transcripts from 4 wild M. rosenbergii stocks of India using the amplicon approach and high-throughput sequencing platforms. Out of 320 SNPs detected, 134 were common to all stocks while 3 were diagnostic. Pair-wise Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic distances (0.304\xe2\x80\x930.469) showed phylogeny consistent with geographical distribution. AMOVA analysis revealed estimated variance of 21.5 among populations. The transition to transversion ratio was 2.20. Changes in amino acid classes and peptide stability were recorded for 80 non-synonymous SNPs while change in codon preference was noted for 138 synonymous ones. Four pathogen defence genes were highly polymorphic, of which lectin 3 had the highest SNP rate (6 SNPs/100\xc2\xa0bp). This approach for mining SNPs and using them for population differentiation in a single step is reported for the first time.'

Abstract: 'A rapid micropropagation system was established forHolostemma annulare (Roxb.) K. Schum., (H. ada-kodien R. Br. ex Schult; Asclepiadaceae), a rare medicinal plant. Shoot tips (0.5\xe2\x80\x930.8 cm) and terminal and basal nodes (1.0\xe2\x80\x931.5 cm) harvested from actively growing shoots of conventionally raised plants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with various concentrations of 6-benzyladenine (BA) and \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Multiple shoot formation (3.8) was observed in 68% of basal nodes cultured on medium with optimum concentration of 4.43 \xce\xbcM BA and 0.54 \xce\xbcM NAA after 8 wk. Terminal nodes were not suitable for inducing multiple shoots. Irrespective of the orientation (vertical/horizontal), all shoot tip explants responded with a single shoot in all the combinations of plant growth regulators tried. Effects of other cytokinins (kinetin and 2-isopentenyladenine) and auxins [indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)] to enhance the regeneration potential of basal nodes were analyzed. Shoots were multiplied by subculture of basal nodes and stumps (the original explant tissue free of shoots, but with remnant axillary, meristem and two or three protruding buds) in a reduced concentration of BA (2.21 \xce\xbcM) and NAA (0.27 \xce\xbcM). Liquid medium for multiplication was found to be ineffective due to a high degree of hyperhydricity. To make the multiplication process cost effective, culture bottles with polypropylene, caps were used for multiplication. The best root induction (75%) and survival (80%) was achieved on 0.5 strength MS medium supplemented with 1.48 \xce\xbcM IBA. Field-established plants had uniform growth habit traits in terms of height of plants and number, length, and weight of the tuberous roots.'

Abstract: 'We evaluated trained listener\xe2\x80\x94based acoustic sampling as a reliable and non-invasive method for rapid assessment of ensiferan species diversity in tropical evergreen forests. This was done by evaluating the reliability of identification of species and numbers of calling individuals using psychoacoustic experiments in the laboratory and by comparing psychoacoustic sampling in the field with ambient noise recordings made at the same time. The reliability of correct species identification by the trained listener was 100 % for 16 out of 20 species tested in the laboratory. The reliability of identifying the numbers of individuals correctly was 100% for 13 out of 20 species. The human listener performed slightly better than the instrument in detecting low frequency and broadband calls in the field, whereas the recorder detected high frequency calls with greater probability. To address the problem of pseudoreplication during spot sampling in the field, we monitored the movement of calling individuals using focal animal sampling. The average distance moved by calling individuals for 17 out of 20 species was less than 1.5\xc2\xa0m in half an hour. We suggest that trained listener\xe2\x80\x94based sampling is preferable for crickets and low frequency katydids, whereas broadband recorders are preferable for katydid species with high frequency calls for accurate estimation of ensiferan species richness and relative abundance in an area.'

Abstract: 'Environmental, biological, socio-cultural and economic status variation existing in the Central Himalaya have led to the evolution of diverse and unique traditional agroecosystems, crop species and livestock, which facilitate the traditional mountain farming societies to sustain themselves. Indigenous agroecosystems are highly site specific and differ from place to place, as they have evolved along divergent lines. For maintenance of traditional agrodiversity management the farmers of the Central Himalaya have evolved various types of crop rotations in consonance with the varied environmental conditions and agronomic requirements. In irrigated flat lands two crops are harvested in a year with negligible fallow period but in rainfed conditions if a cropping sequence is presumed to be starting after winter fallow phase then four major cropping seasons can be identified namely first kharif season (first crop season), first rabi season (second crop season), second kharif season (third crop season) and second rabi season (fourth crop season). Highest crop diversity is present in kharif season in comparison to rabi season. Traditionally the fields are left fallow after harvest of the second kharif season crop. Important characteristics of agrodiversity management are the use of bullocks for draught power, human energy as labour, crop residues as animal feed and animal waste mixed with forest litter as organic input to restore soil fertility levels. Women provide most of the human labour except for ploughing and threshing grain. The present study deals with assessment of traditional agrodiversity management such as (i) crop diversity, (ii) realized yield under the traditional practices and (iii) assess the differences of realized yields under sole and mixed cropping systems. It indicated that crop rotation is an important feature of the Central Himalayan village ecosystem which helps to continue the diversity of species grown, as are the distribution of crops in the growing period and the management of soil fertility. The cropping diversity existing and the sequences practiced by the traditional farmers seems to have achieved high degree of specialization and thus even when the yield/biomass variations are about 60%, the farmers continue to practice these sequences as they need to maintain diversity and synergistic relationships of crops in addition to manage the food and labour requirements for crop husbandry. Crop yields are generally higher in irrigated systems than rainfed systems and in sole cropping as compared with mixed cropping. However, gross biological and economic yields are higher in mixed cropping than sole cropping systems.'

Abstract: 'Plant regeneration through direct somatic embryogenesis was achieved from root segments derived from in vitro shoots of Rauvolfia micrantha Hook. f. (Apocynaceae) grown for 6 wk in half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 3% sucrose, 100 mgl\xe2\x88\x921 myo-inositol, and 0.5 mgl\xe2\x88\x921 \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The effects of photoperiod and plant growth regulators (PGRs) in half-strength MS medium were studied for the rapid and maximum induction of somatic embryos. The characteristic globular or heart-shaped stages of somatic embryogenesis were not found and cotyledonary stage embryos occasionally appeared without the intervention of callus in total darkness and 16-h photoperiod. Root segments cultured in the medium containing 0.1 mgl\xe2\x88\x921 NAA and 0.2 mgl\xe2\x88\x921 6-benzyladenine (BA) under 16-h photoperiod showed the maximum frequency (39%) of embryogenesis. The frequency of embryo formation was increased to 63% when they were cultured in medium with 0.1 mgl\xe2\x88\x921 NAA and 0.2 mgl\xe2\x88\x921 BA in the dark for 4wk, then grown under the 16-h photoperiod. Explants with developing embryos developed into plants after transfer to half-strength MS medium supplemented with 0.1 mgl\xe2\x88\x921 BA and 0.05 mgl\xe2\x88\x921 NAA. The well-developed plants were hardened and most plants (80%) survived and were phenotypically similar to the mother plants.'

Abstract: 'Present study was carried out in Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh characterized by mountainous terrain coupled with torrential rainfall. Forests and agriculture land cover are exposed to varied level of anthropogenic and deforestation activities. All these have augmented into pronounced soil erosion thereby negatively impacting the socio-economy of the rural population. Topographic, management, soil and landuse factors were among the most important drivers influencing the soil erosion. Keeping above in account, present study emphasizes the applicability of geospatial technology coupled with field data to estimate soil erosion rate which could be helpful in developing suitable management plan. Numerous empirical models are available for estimating soil erosion; however, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system framework was applied in the current study due to its robustness and simplicity. RUSLE factors such as erosivity of rainfall (RE), erodibility of soil (ES), slope length (LS), crop management (CM) and conservation practice (CP) were calculated using available data. Rainfall erosivity factor was 323.8\xc2\xa0MJ mm/ha/h/year. ES factor ranged from 0.16 to 0.28\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0h/MJ/mm and LS factor ranges between 0 and 44.62. NDVI derived crop management factor ranges between 0 and 1.7. Conservation practice factor values ranged from 0.004 to 1. The annual soil loss was modeled using different factors of RULSE model and soil loss was predicted (1.38\xe2\x80\x9359.05 ton per hectare). Keeping threshold value of soil erosion (<\xe2\x80\x8910 ton per hectare) in account, most part of the study area is suitable for agriculture practices however, emphasis on suitable soil and water conservation measures are perquisite for sustainable environment management.'

Abstract: 'Understanding phyto-geographical distribution pattern and ethnobotanical applications are critical for comprehensive conservation and utilisation of native plant genetic resources. Dearth of such scientific reports on Corchorus species in India seriously compromises inclusiveness, precision and penetration of national endeavour to conserve the valuable resources. In this context, an ecogeographical study conducted to analyse geographical distribution, ecological adaptation, species richness and ethnobotanical applications of the genus in the country. The study revealed pandemic distribution of the genus with differential habitat preferences. Combine geographical, edaphic and precipitation based distribution profile of Corchorus spp. demonstrated multilayer interactions between species and environment that led to their differential spatial distribution. The highest species concentration was found in Tamil Nadu followed by Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Complementarity analysis showed that the major diversity hotspots for the genus present in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Besides, wide spectrum ethnobotanical applications of the genus reflect their long association with prevailing ethnic communities across regions. Documentation of such time honoured traditional practices has special bearing on designing comprehensive conservation and management strategies. This information will help to prioritise both ex-situ and in-situ conservation efforts for the genus particularly in ecologically vulnerable sites of India.'

Abstract: 'The Late Cretaceous/Palaeogene Deccan Traps, spread over half a million square kilometres in west-central parts of the Indian Peninsula, comprises predominantly basalts and subordinate felsic rocks (rhyolite, trachyte, tinguaites and spilites). The use of Deccan basalts and trachyte in the range of Indian architectonic heritage, from antiquity to current times, is quite fascinating. The abundance and ease of workability of Deccan Trap rocks render them the most preferred building material in all the architectonic heritage structures that document various cultural and ethnic habitations in the west central India. The Buddhist, Hindu and Jain temples of Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta are the oldest in-situ basalt cave temples, dating back to second century. A contemporary iconic architectonic heritage \xe2\x80\x98The Gateway of India\xe2\x80\x99 personifies a majestic edifice built in buff coloured trachyte. In the present times, the Deccan basalts are being quarried for a variety of purposes such as masonry stone for buildings, road metal and as raw material for corrosion-resistant basaltic pipes and basalt wool that are also in great demand internationally. The trachyte quarries are almost extinct and relict trachyte outcrops are preserved in some places in and around Mumbai. The Deccan Trap rocks basalt and trachyte bear testimony to India\xe2\x80\x99s cultural and architectonic heritage, are therefore, the most suitable candidates for according the status of Global Heritage Stone Resource (GHSR)\xc2\xa0as they fulfil all the requisite criteria specified by the IUGS subcommission on Hertaiage stones\xc2\xa0referred to as the Heritage Stone Subcommission (HSS). It is worthwhile to mention that both basalt and trachyte of the Deccan Traps are in geographic and geological proximity with each other and this qualifies Deccan Trap province to be recognised as a Global Heritage Stone Province (GHSP) from this subcontinent in consonance with the criteria for GHSP mentioned in the terms of reference given by HSS.'

Abstract: 'Agrobiodiversity is an evident outcome of a long-lasting human\xe2\x80\x93nature relationship, as the continuous use, conservation and management of crops has resulted in biological as well as cultural diversity of seeds and breeds. This paper aims to understand the interlocking of formal and informal seed supply routes by considering the dynamic flow of seeds within networks across the intersections of gender, ethnicity and age in South India as social categories structuring human\xe2\x80\x93nature relations. This changing relationship under formal and informal institutional settings has consequences on performance for men and women in rice seed systems. Undertaking an empirical analysis of the organization of seed management and exchange, we seek to shed light on the gendered organization of agrobiodiversity as a social network. The study builds on Net-Map interviews conducted in 2012, embedded in the larger BioDIVA project in the district of Wayanad in Kerala, India. Based on network analysis, the interactive method employed has enabled identification of important actors in the seed system and the characteristics of their relationships. We look into the gendered structure of information exchange regarding seed varieties and actual seed transactions, while also examining clusters of actors collaborating regarding seed supply. Finally, we identify the institutional gap concerning seed sources left by formal and informal institutions, like the availability of varieties. We show how informal and formal seed systems coexist and overlap due to actors moving between systems and argue that the degree and areas of overlap are shaped by gendered human\xe2\x80\x93nature relations.'

Abstract: 'Hydrogeochemistry and groundwater quality of the Kadava River Basin have been performed by analyzing 40 groundwater samples for pre- and post-monsoon seasons of 2011 through different geostatistical techniques. Analyses showed that the concentrations of Mg2+ exceeded Ca2+ in both the seasons suggesting silicate weathering as a source of ions. Average Ca\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89Mg values contribute 73.53% of total cations and signify the major supply of mafic minerals. Elevated TDS and TH limit drinking potential and other beneficial uses indicate permanently hard water. The average concentrations of the anions were found within Indian PL except NO3, attributed to use of fertilizers. The spatial distribution maps show the EC, Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 to be generally higher for both the seasons in flood plain deposits than denuded landforms and middle-level/high-level plateaus containing fractured basalt aquifers. It is confirmed that silicate weathering is the dominant process followed by carbonate weathering. Inputs of TDS, Cl, SO4, Mg, Na, and NO3 are influenced by rainfall and human activities. Groundwater sample numbers 20, 37, and 38 have been severely impacted from agricultural runoff as these samples are located along the surface water flow path. The high loading of TDS and TH is controlled by the Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 ions. Elevated concentration of Na over Ca represents the ion exchange between Ca and Na. High contents of Mg, Na, Cl, and SO4 corroborate that the groundwater is influenced by anthropogenic sources. This study is an insight for water managers to address groundwater pollution problems.'

Title: 'The Nature and Distribution of Particulate Matter in the Mandovi Estuary, Central West Coast of India'

Abstract: 'Systematic seasonal variations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) along a 44-km transect of the Mandovi estuary reveal that the concentrations of SPM are low at river-end stations, increase generally seaward, and are highest at sea-end stations of the estuary. An estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) occurs at sea-end stations during June\xe2\x80\x93September when river discharge is high and also in February\xe2\x80\x93May when river discharge is low. These are the two windiest times of year, the former associated with the southwest monsoon and the latter characterized by a persistent sea breeze. The salinity vs. SPM plot shows that high SPM is a seaward deposit and skewed landward. Suspended matter comprised of floccules, fecal pellets, and aggregates that consist of clay and biogenic particles occur everywhere in the estuary. Diatoms are the most common and are of marine type at the sea-end and freshwater-dominated at river-end stations of the estuary. SPM is characterized by kaolinite- and smectite-rich clay mineral suites at the river- and sea-end stations, respectively. Smectite concentrations increase seawards with the increase in SPM content and are not influenced by salinity. Wind-driven waves and currents and biogeochemical processes at the mouth of estuary likely play an important role in the formation of ETM in resuspension and transformation of SPM into floccules and aggregates and in their upkeep or removal.'

Abstract: 'The group size, age and sex ratio of gaur was studied in the Tropical Deciduous habitat of Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary, Odisha, eastern India, during 2012\xe2\x80\x932013. Gaurs were observed by regular monitoring along the motorable roads and forest trails covering a total 3864\xc2\xa0km. The overall mean group size and crowding were 6.92\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.02 (SE) and 6.9 respectively which varied significantly between seasons. The sex ratio was skewed to females and there was an increase in adult male ratio during winter season. Calves were observed throughout the year with a slightly peak during December and January. Compared to the gaur population from other regions of India, the group size range in Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary is the smaller one, thus indicating a low population density. Therefore, appropriate management intervention is required for long term conservation of the species.'

Title: 'Protecting Indigenous Values in Water Management: A Challenge to Conventional Environmental Flow Assessments'

Abstract: 'Although environmental flow assessments and allocations have been practiced in Australia for nearly 20\xc2\xa0years, to date they have not effectively incorporated indigenous values. In many cases, even though indigenous people rely substantially on aquatic resources, environmental flows have been assumed to be an acceptable surrogate for the protection of indigenous interests. This paper argues that the need to adapt flow assessments to account for linkages and dependencies between people and rivers is equally applicable to developed world indigenous contexts such as Australia as it is to developing countries where there has been some attempt to address indigenous or subsistence water requirements. We propose three challenges to conventional environmental flow assessments that, if met, will improve the ability of water resource planning to address indigenous interests. The first challenge is to recognize that in an indigenous context a different suite of species may be considered important when compared to those valued by other stakeholders. Although conservation status or rarity may be important, it is common and widespread species that make substantial contributions to indigenous household incomes through customary use. The second challenge is to accommodate a different set of management objectives in environmental flow allocation. Environmental flows will need to meet the requirement of hunting and fishing activities at rates that are socially and economically sustainable. The third and arguably most theoretically challenging task is for environmental flow assessments to take into account indigenous worldviews and the quality of people\xe2\x80\x93place relationships that are significant in indigenous cultures. Meeting these three challenges to environmental flow assessment will assist water management agencies and other practitioners to protect indigenous interests as water allocation decisions are made.'

Abstract: 'We identified 67 and 21 NTFP-yielding plant and animal species, respectively, in a reserve forest in Cachar district of Assam. We recorded globally threatened species listed by IUCN as Critically Endangered (plant species Dipterocarpus turbinatus), Vulnerable (plant species Aquillaria malaccensis), Endangered (animal species Hoolock hoolock, Indotestudo elongata and Manis pentadactyla), and Vulnerable (animal species Nilssonia hurum and Rusa unicolor). The whole plant or animal and/or their various parts were used as food or medicine, in house construction, magico-religious activities and others. While some NTFPs were harvested throughout the year, others were harvested seasonally. A comprehensive NTFP policy, along with scientific measures for regeneration, restoration and augmentation of NTFP-yielding plants and animals, would help in addressing the conflicting demands of conservation and livelihood in the forests of this area.'

Abstract: 'Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in many cellular processes, including seed development, dormancy, germination and stress responses. Investigation on changes in endogenous ABA content of Saraca asoca seeds during development and artificial dehydration by indirect competitive ELISA method explains their influence on viability. The low ABA levels towards later stages of seed development validates non-orthodox nature of species. About 37% germination was observed in immature seeds of 60\xc2\xa0days after anthesis onwards, which possess comparatively higher ABA content of 0.92\xc2\xa0nmol\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0fr.\xc2\xa0wt. In the course of seed maturation gradual loss of ABA was noticed with concurrent increase in germination. Artificial seed drying in open laboratory condition for five different periods, viz., 48, 96, 144, 192 and 240\xc2\xa0h registered 49.7, 48.4, 46.9, 45.2 and 42.8% moisture contents, respectively, in fresh and mature seeds as control which possess moisture content of 51.6 with 100% germination. Dehydration of seeds results the significant increase of abscisic acid level in embryonic axis but the viability was declined simultaneously. So the present study deals with the influence of abscisic acid in desiccation tolerance during maturation and dehydration of recalcitrant seeds of Saraca asoca.'

Abstract: 'In a major deviation from conventional joint forest management approaches where the emphasis of management is on provision of forest products to the participating villagers, the Tamil Nadu Afforestation Project (TAP) focused on poverty alleviation as the principal means to achieve sustainable forest management. This study assesses the effectiveness of TAP\xe2\x80\x99s strategy in improving the ecology and socio-economic conditions of forest fringe villages using a diverse set of research methods. Results indicate that in a span of four to seven years, there was significant increase in forest cover, biodiversity, and agricultural productivity. The project villages have also shown considerable progress in various indicators of socio-economic development. The authors, however, suggest continued poverty alleviation and promotion of alternative livelihood opportunities to place the programme on a stable ground. Meeting the development needs of local villagers through strong and durable institutional linkages is also suggested for the programme to sustain and succeed.'

Title: 'Exotic shrub invasion in a montane grassland: the role of fire as a potential restoration tool'

Abstract: 'In recent years, invasion of native grasslands by exotic woody plants has been recognized as a global problem with multiple adverse ecological and socio-economic consequences. Reasons for such expansions are numerous, including fire suppression. An important example of this problem is the native montane grassland in the Nilgiris of the Western Ghats in India, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by invasion of multiple woody species. In this study, the impacts of the highly invasive, nitrogen fixing exotic shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) on the grassland community and ecosystem function have been quantified and the role of fire as a potential management tool evaluated. I established paired plots in uninvaded and broom-invaded grasslands that were either unburned or burned by an unplanned wildfire event. Invasion negatively impacted the grassland community structure and composition, favoring shade tolerant and weedy native plants, but did not greatly alter ecosystem function. Burning broom patches to eliminate the stands resulted in lower soil moisture and nitrogen levels 18\xc2\xa0months after the fire. Yet, there were no notable fire effects on the grassland communities or ecosystem properties. Taken together, the results suggest that fire might be an effective tool for broom control. At the end of the study period burned-broom communities did not become more similar to uninvaded-grasslands; presumably the recovery process may be slow without additional management intervention.'

Abstract: 'The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS III satellite imagery was used to classify three landscapes in the upper Satluj river watershed in Kinnaur region of western Himalaya viz. Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh. These landscapes representing different eco-climatic zones were subjected to landscape ecological analysis and various landscape composition, patch and edge characteristic metrics were computed to find the extent of fragmentation in the natural vegetation. The natural vegetation comprised of forests (10.24%), grasslands (31.04%) and scrublands (2.95%) as the landscape elements (LSE). These LSEs were further segregated into different LSE types based on the dominant species of plant communities in the landscapes. These LSE types were surveyed for species diversity in the three landscapes. The total landscape area (TLA) covered by natural vegetation in Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh landscapes was calculated to be 651.42, 529.02 and 1,673.72\xc2\xa0km2 making the total area covered with natural vegetation in the district as 2,854.16\xc2\xa0km2. The Pooh block, lying in the east of the district, though covered the largest area of the landscape, was poor in terms of landscape composition as compared to the Nichar block which was rich in landscape elements as suggested by the diversity measures. The extent of fragmentation was found to be highest in Nichar. The Nichar landscape was observed to be having higher mean values of species diversity than other blocks which is consistent with the trends observed with patches diversity. This was in contrast to the Pooh landscape where the patch diversity as well as the species diversity was the lowest. Thus, an ecological analysis utilizing landscape metrics and biodiversity field sampling of vegetation, was attempted for such heterogenous landscapes in high altitudes of Himalaya, which provided a baseline data for the management and conservation of these virgin mountainous areas.'

Title: 'Assessing Sustainability of Nontimber Forest Product Extractions: How Fire Affects Sustainability'

Abstract: 'Sustainable use of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) can be affected by levels of extractions as well as by other anthropogenic influences such as fire and grazing. We examined the effects of fire on the demography of Phyllanthus emblica, an important NTFP in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. We then assessed demographic responses to the combined effects of fire and current fruit harvesting patterns. Fruits of Phyllanthus are commercially harvested by an indigenous forest dwelling people. Using matrix population models, we compared demographic indices across a chronosequence of time since last fire. Population growth rates (\xce\xbb) ranged from 0.7692 to 1.1443 across the five times since last fire. \xce\xbb was the lowest at times since last fire of 2 and 3\xc2\xa0yr. Frequent fires increased time to maturity by altering growth and survival rates, thereby causing a demographic shift from growth to regressions or negative growth. Elasticity analysis revealed that stasis of adults makes the biggest contribution to \xce\xbb. Simulations of periodic and stochastic fire regimes suggest that higher \xce\xbb and population persistence can be achieved at fire-return intervals of \xe2\x89\xa57 and \xe2\x89\xa59\xc2\xa0yr, respectively. These fire-return intervals became longer when the simulations included harvesting and fire. Extinction probabilities under the current fire regimes (every 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0yr) suggest that populations will decline to lower densities. Our findings provide critical information for developing guidelines for sustainable use and management of NTFPs in Biligiri Rangan Hills, and demonstrate the need to incorporate various human-generated physical regimes in assessing sustainability of NTFPs.'

Abstract: 'The handicrafts made fromSyngonanthus nitens scapes have been an important source of income for rural communities in the Jalap\xc3\xa3o region of Brazil since the late 1990s. This study analyzedS. nitens harvest and management techniques and the economic importance of the handicrafts. We also tested the effects of harvest onS. nitens population ecology. Handicrafts provide about US$1,800/year per artisan, being especially important to women. Experimental scape harvesting in mid-October, which is when knowledgeable artisans harvest and when the seeds are mature, had no consistent effects on population density, plant survival, or reproduction (clonal or sexual) after one year. Since 40% of the new recruits come from seeds, harvest after seed maturation, combined with removal of only the scapes and not the flowerheads, can allow forS. nitens seeds to remain in the populations and help ensure sustainability of the growingS. nitens handicraft activity. Important economic aspects ofS. nitens harvest sustainability include the high value of the handicrafts and the fact they are not perishable.'

Abstract: 'Kuttiyadi river basin in the South Indian state of Kerala has been analyzed for planning watershed management activities. Geohydrological behavior of the watershed was analyzed by calculating the morphometric parameters. Linear, relief, and areal parameters were determined using standard equations. Kuttiyadi is a sixth order basin, characterized by maximum relief and gradients in the eastern part, exhibiting highest runoff and susceptibility to flooding and inundation. Relative drainage density data suggest that subwatersheds II and III are mature basins in steady state equilibrium with components like climate, lithology, tectonism, and landscape components. Multi criteria decision making approach was followed for watershed prioritization. Given the interrelationship that exists among the different morphometric parameters as well as the complexity due to the integrated effect of these parameters on soil erosion, analytic network process was employed. Length of overland flow was found to be the most influential morphological parameter in watershed prioritization. High priority subwatershed identified in this study must be taken up for immediate action with respect to soil conservation activities. Suitable locations for construction of check-dams as water conservation structures were identified. This study has shown that morphometric analysis along with multi criteria decision making would serve as a powerful tool in watershed planning where complex interrelationship exists among different morphological parameters.'

Abstract: 'Landforms of Mumbai Island have been largely modified by the urban sprawl and the demand for groundwater will increase exponentially in the future. Quality and quantity of groundwater occurrence in island are highly influenced by the geomorphic units. As this metropolis receives heavy rainfall, the area rarely faces the issue of water scarcity, nevertheless, quality always remains a question. The landforms of Mumbai Island have been shaped by a combination of fluvial, denudational and marine processes. These landforms are categorized into two broad zones on the basis of its influence in groundwater occurrence. Denudational landforms are categorized as runoff zones whereas the other two are categorized as storage zones. This classification is on the basis of occurrence and storage of groundwater. Mumbai Island is exposed to frequent sea water incursion and groundwater quality has deteriorated. The varied hydrogeological conditions prevalent in this area prevent rapid infiltration. This combined with the overextraction of groundwater resources for agriculture and industry has caused serious concern about the continued availability of potable water. This study aims at validating the geomorphic classification of the landforms with hydrogeochemistry and borehole data and it proved that geomorphology corroborates with groundwater chemistry and subsurface geology.'

Abstract: 'In the present manuscript, we analyzed the pre-monsoon (March\xe2\x80\x93April\xe2\x80\x93May) rainfall over the Indian summer monsoon region using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) rainfall datasets during 1979\xe2\x80\x932015. It is found that the rainfall over the Bay of Bengal (BOB) has increased significantly and it is associated with the strengthening of local Hadley circulation over the BOB. The increasing Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over the Indian Ocean is playing an important role to the observed changes in convections and cloudiness over the BOB. In addition, the strengthening of the westerly enhances the wind speed and transports more moisture to the North Indian Ocean. In addition, warming of the SST and large-scale moisture convergence cause the rainfall to increase and the latent heat released in the process strengthens the divergent wind at 200\xc2\xa0hPa. This strengthens the local Hadley circulation over the BOB, which may affect the monsoon strength over the Indian subcontinent, by influencing the onset of the Indian summer monsoon. This study will improve the understanding by monitoring the changes in the atmospheric processes over the BOB and the Indian subcontinent, which may result in better predictability of the Indian summer monsoon.'

Abstract: 'In the Indian subcontinent there is hardly any study that compares the bird community structure of urban/suburban areas with those of forest habitat. The present survey identified diverse assemblages of birds in the Pauri district at different elevations. A total of 125 bird species belonging to 40 families including two least count species (Lophura leucomelanos and Pucrasia marcolopha) were recorded during this survey in the forest and urbanized habitats of Pauri District (Garhwal Hiamalaya) of Uttarakhand state, India. The high elevation (Pauri 1600\xe2\x80\x932100 m a.s.l.), mid elevation (Srikot-Khanda 900\xe2\x80\x931300 m a.s.l.) and low elevation (Srinagar 500\xe2\x80\x93900 m a.s.l.) contributed 88.8%, 63.2% and 58.4% of the total species respectively. Rarefaction analysis and Shannon diversity index showed that the high elevation forest habitat had highest bird species richness (BSR) and bird species diversity (BSD) followed by the mid and then the low elevation forests. BSR and BSD fluctuated across seasons at all elevations but not across habitat types. Present study provides a base line data about avian community composition in urbanized and natural habitats along altitudinal gradient in the study area. This information may be useful to the conservation biologists for the better management and conservation of the avifauna in the Western Himalaya, a part of one of the hot biodiversity spots of the world.'

Abstract: ' Agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated transformation of Decalepis arayalpathra, an ethnomedicinal plant, was achieved by infecting juvenile hypocotyl explants with different strains, including A4, MTCC 532, TR105 and LBA 5402. Hypocotyl explants induced hairy roots at a higher frequency (53.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.3\xc2\xa0%) than cotyledons (32.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.2\xc2\xa0%) when infected with the most virulent strain TR105. The explants co-cultivated 48\xc2\xa0h in half-strength salts and vitamins of Murashige and Skoog basal medium (half-MSB) induced hairy roots either directly from the wounds or followed by the formation of gall like structures. Irrespective of the explants, the strain MTCC 532 induced callus alone. The root initials on the galls proliferated vigorously and elongated more rapidly when they were segmented and subcultured on half-MSB medium than the proliferation and elongation of directly emerged roots. The established hairy roots showed intermittent gall formation which was the active sites for hairy roots induction. The molecular evidence of rol A and rol C gene integration was confirmed by PCR amplification  and southern blot hybridization. Growth of the hairy roots was undertaken by measuring root growth unit after culturing root tips in half-MSB solid medium and determined fresh weight/dry weight/conductivity during time-course study in shake flask cultures. The maximum biomass and accumulation of the root specific compound, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde (MBALD) (0.22\xc2\xa0% dry weight), was recorded at the 6th week of growth, which was more than that observed in normal root cultures (0.16\xc2\xa0% dry weight).'

Subculture of sprouted shoots from the original explants on medium containing TDZ (1.13 and 0.45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) during the first and second subcultures was found essential for further shoot proliferation, while inhibition of shoot elongation by TDZ could be overcome by transferring shoot cultures onto MS medium containing 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP; 11.10\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) for the third subculture. Treating the explants with an antioxidant mixture of 568\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M ascorbic acid, 119\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M citric acid, and 307\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M glutathione prior to inoculation, coupled with subculture at 2-wk intervals onto fresh medium, both helped to reduce browning of the explants and facilitated production of five to six shoots/explant. MS medium supplemented with BAP (4.44\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) and IBA (0.49\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) induced shoot multiplication, producing five to six shoots/explant with a shoot length of 3 to 4\xc2\xa0cm over a 4-wk culture period. Shoots of 3 to 4\xc2\xa0cm in length exhibited 100% rooting within 4\xc2\xa0wk after transfer to media containing half the nutrient salt concentration of MS medium with 3.69\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M IBA. Ex vitro rooting in the greenhouse from the in vitro shoots treated with 4.93\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M IBA for 30\xc2\xa0min exhibited 95% rooting in soilrite\xe2\x84\xa2 medium in a 4-wk period. About 85% of micropropagated plants were established successfully in root trainers. Three-month-old, hardened plants could further be successfully established in the field. In 1\xc2\xa0yr, by using the above protocol, 3,200 plants could be produced from a single shoot and 2,700 could be established in the field.'

Title: 'Agroforestry coffee production increased by native shade trees, irrigation, and liming'

Abstract: 'Agroforestry systems usually include a high density and diversity of shade trees. Such systems often have a large diversity of fauna and flora and provide local and regional ecosystem services. Shade trees are, however, being removed to increase crop production in many tropical regions. There is little knowledge on the effect of shade trees on crop production in the context of trade-offs with other management practices. We therefore compared the benefits of exotic versus native shade trees on coffee production. We evaluated the importance of shade tree management for crop production in the context of management practices. Management practices included fertilization, liming, coffee pruning, weeding, and irrigation in 113 coffee agroforests in Kodagu, India, over a wide range of shade tree density, tree species diversity, and shade cover. We studied, in particular, Grevillea and non-Grevillea shade trees, the latter including mostly native tree species. Results show that a rise of 100 non-Grevillea shade tree per hectare increased production of berries by 5.6\xc2\xa0% and larger beans by 6.25\xc2\xa0%. Irrigation and liming increased berry production respectively by 16 and 20\xc2\xa0%. These management interventions are likely to offset the relatively small negative effect of reducing shade density of non-Grevillea trees on coffee production. Recommendations based on an understanding of shade tree management alone can be misleading with regard to crop production.'

Abstract: 'An efficient in vitro plant regeneration system was established through somatic embryogenesis for Anoectochilus elatus Lindley, an endangered jewel orchid. Direct somatic embryogenesis was achieved from nodal explants (17.4 embryos per explant with 63.4% response) on Mitra medium supplemented with Morel vitamins, thidiazuron (4.54\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) and \xe2\x88\x9e-naphthaleneacetic acid (2.69\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M). Simultaneously, a protocol was developed for\xc2\xa0indirect somatic embryogenesis from internodal explant, produced embryogenic calli and embryos (31.3 embryos with 76.4% response) on same medium amended with 50\xc2\xa0mg/L peptone and 5% coconut water. Both types of embryogenic pathways, produced morphologically similar globular embryos in the form of protocorm like bodies and successfully germinated on hormone free Mitra medium supplemented with Morel vitamins. Morpho-histological investigation of the embryo revealed the\xc2\xa0initiation and developmental features of somatic embryos. In vitro regenerated plantlets were successfully established from heterotrophic to a photoautotrophic stage by reducing the nutrient content in culture media, adjusting temperature and humidity through three step method. During the process, no morphological and physiological abnormalities were observed. Hardened plantlets were successfully acclimatized at poly tunnel chamber with 95% of survival rate. Further, inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) molecular markers were used to analyse the genetic homogeneity of regenerated plants. Analysis with this method showed that the homogeneity is comparatively higher in direct somatic embryo regenerated plants (94.22%) as compared to plants elevated from an indirect somatic embryo (93.05%). The present study provides morpho-histological and genetically stable plants for germplasm conservation and further utility of this endangered jewel orchid.'

Abstract: 'An efficient in vitro regeneration protocol through somatic embryogenesis was established from stem transverse thin cell layers (tTCLs) of Dendrobium aqueum Lindley, an imperiled orchid. This study outlines the induction and successive maturation stages of D. aqueum somatic embryos (SEs). The tTCLs (~ 0.5 mm thick) cultured on halfstrength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing cytokinins and auxins, either individually or in combination, produced embryogenic callus (EC). Treatment with 0.5 mg dm-3 zeatin induced EC in 41.42 % of tTCLs. As many as 42.66 globular SEs per tTCL were formed in the presence of 1.5 mg dm-3N6-(2-isopentyl) adenine (2iP) but only on 10.33 % of explants. The combined treatment of 2iP (1.5 mg dm-3) and 0.5 mg dm-3 6-benzyladenine resulted in 34 globular SEs on 14.7 % of tTCLs whereas the combination of 2iP and 1.0 mg dm-3 indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) induced 7.4 globular SEs on 52.33 % of tTCLs. Supplementation of activated charcoal, amino acids, and antioxidants alleviated browning at all the concentrations tested, but the EC response declined. The addition of 0.5 mg dm-3 polyvinylpyrrolidone to 1.5 mg dm-3 2iP and 1.0 mg dm-3 IBA produced 24 SEs on 19.89 % of tTCLs suggesting that the EC and SEs can be effectively induced by individual cytokinins whereas the synergistic treatments with other compounds can only enhance the induction of EC. Histological observations of EC showed the formation of globular SEs from sub-epidermal regions. Successive developmental stages of globular SEs and the intermediate stage of protocorm like bodies until the formation of plantlets were observed. The plantlets obtained through SEs showed no morphological variations, and inter simple sequence repeat profiles also confirmed the genetic fidelity of in vitro-derived progeny with high monomorphism (97.78 %). In conclusion, the use of stem tTCLs is an effective method to produce SEs through indirect somatic embryogenesis in D. aqueum.'

Abstract: ' In vitro propagation of three rare, endangered and endemic rhododendron species\xe2\x80\x94Rhododendron dalhousiae var. rhabdotum, R. elliottii, and R. johnstoneanum\xe2\x80\x94was attained. Nodal explants were used for multiple shoot induction studies. Three cytokinins (isopentenyladenine, benzyladenine, and kinetin) were evaluated in all three species. Isopentenyladenine performed better in all three species, especially at the concentration of 39.36 \xc2\xb5M. Testing of combinations of growth regulators revealed that explants grown on Anderson medium supplemented with 39.36 \xc2\xb5M isopentenyladenine and 4.90 \xc2\xb5M indole butyric acid gave optimum results with 100% multiple shoot induction, 18 shoots per explant, and shoot length of 2.07 cm with R. johnstoneanum. Indole butyric acid was found to be the best auxin for root formation. Around 60% of the in vitro-raised plants of R. elliottii, R. johnstoneanum, and R. dalhousiae var. rhabdotum were able to establish ex vitro.'

Abstract: 'Morphometric analysis is an indispensable tool for hydrological investigation that involves the development and management of drainage basin. This study characterizes the micro watersheds in the Palar sub-watershed using morphometric analysis and assesses its risk by land use and land cover features in a particular micro watershed. Palar sub-watershed is divided into 6 micro watersheds for prioritization based on morphometric and land use analysis. Several morphometric parameters (linear, shape and relief) are determined from the drainage map; ranks are assigned based on their capacity to induce erodability and degradation. Final ranking is based on the composite index calculated from the sum of the ranks of each morphometric parameter. Morphometric analysis reveals micro watersheds 5 and 6 as most susceptible and 2 and 3 as low susceptible. Land use is mapped using IRS ID LISS III satellite data. The risk in terms of watershed degradation involved to each micro watershed is based on the ranks of each land use feature, obtained from a similar composite index as that of morphometric analysis. Land use analysis shows that micro watersheds 2 and 4 fall under high priority category while 5 and 6 under low priority category. Integration of the morphometric and land use analysis shows that only micro watershed 1 falls under the same category in both analyses. Control measures are suggested to contain degradation depending on its specific land use pattern and morphometric features. This study can be used to prepare a comprehensive watershed plan for the development or for planning resource conservation strategies, by integrating land use features with the drainage characteristics of the region, in particular for a hill ecosystem as the prioritization is at micro level.'

Abstract: 'Long before the applications of Science and Technology for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development became a recognized field of human endeavour, there have been attempts by individuals and institutions who had the commitment and wisdom to begin the effort. The authors have chosen historical incidents tracing the rudiments of the work of Emperor Ashoka, to the Bishnois of Rajasthan, John Muir, a Scottish-born American in USA, Richard St. Barbe Baker and Wangari Maathai in Africa. People such as Chico Mendes lost their life in preventing the destruction of great Amazonian forest and N. I. Vavilov, a Russian geneticist who foresaw the value of collecting large samples of seeds of cultivated plants in seed banks, much against the then prevalent communist doctrine, not believing in the importance of inheritance. The Chipko movement in Garhwal Himalaya started by Gaura devi and other womenfolk supported by Chandi Prasad Bhat and Sunderlal Bahuguna has been briefly traced. References are also made to the work of Jim Corbett and Salim Ali for the conservation of tigers and birds respectively and recounting the enormous movement to save Silent Valley representing tropical evergreen forest in Kerala from being utilized for generating a very small amount of power. The decision taken by Government of India to refuse Vedanta Resources from utilizing the Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa for bauxite mining which is considered as an abode of their Niyamraja, worshipped by the Dongaria Kondh tribe consisting of 8,000 people has been hailed by the Indian people as just. Finally attention is drawn to Prof. A. Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to develop a Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute in Kerala for collection, conservation and sustainable utilization of 800 medicinal plants, orchids, bamboos and other useful tropical plants. A brief note on the intense efforts made by K. S. Manilal in bringing out English and Malayalam Editions of Hortus Malabaricus compiled by Van Rheede in 12 volumes in old Latin between 1678 and 1693 and in publishing the Flora of Silent Valley has been included.'

Abstract: 'Studying biodiversity change in existing typical ecosystems of the world under possible global climate change and local human activities is important for diversity conservation. An adapted forest dynamics model is used to simulate tree diversity change of the remaining primary mixed-broadleaved Korean pine forest (RPMKPF) in northeast China under global climate change and local human activities for the next 50 years. Human activities include logging, which removes all big trees (DBH > 50 cm), removing all individuals of each single species and all species of each functional type (shade tolerant, shade intolerant and medium type tree species). As results for RPMKPF, the \xce\xb1 index of tree diversity decreases under climate change, but it increases significantly under a combination of climate change and logging. Removing all individuals of each single species significantly affects the tree diversity of the ecosystem. After the removal of shade tolerant species, both \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2c indices of tree diversity experience a significant change. The \xce\xb1 index decreases significantly under climate change when shade intolerant or medium type tree species are removed, but the \xce\xb2c index does not change significantly. The results of this study have implications for tree diversity management in RPMKPF under climate change and human activities.'

Abstract: 'N2 fixation (acetylene reduction assay) by phylloplane microorganisms was measured in dominant and co-dominant plant species growing in a tropical rain forest. No significant acetylene reduction was recorded with intact leaf samples. Azotobacter sp., Beijerinckia sp., Derxia sp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated as phylloplane N2-fixing bacteria. Azospirillum lipoferum was only isolated from soil samples containing the roots of Poaceae. Nitrogenase activity was recorded in culture derived from the roots and rhizosphere soil samples, although low acetylene reduction activity indicates that these associations did not provide large amounts of N to the systems studied.'

Abstract: 'Ophiorrhiza mungos var. angustifolia is a herbaceous plant distributed in the southern western ghats of India. The species is extensively uprooted for the extraction of high-value anticancer alkaloid camptothecin (CPT), resulting in the eradication of natural population. The present work aims to develop an in vitro protocol for the sustainable production of CPT from callus and cell suspension cultures of the species to conserve the natural resource. Leaf explant excised from in vitro shoot cultures was inoculated onto solid half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium, fortified with auxins like Indole acetic acid (5.71\xe2\x80\x9326.83\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M), Indole butyric acid (4.92\xe2\x80\x9324.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M), Naphthalene acetic acid (5.71\xe2\x80\x9328.54\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M), 2,4 Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (4.52\xe2\x80\x9322.62\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) and Picloram (4.14\xe2\x80\x9320.70\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M); either individually or in combination with Benzyl\xc2\xa0adenine, to raise the callus. Of the different combinations of auxins, 10.74\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M Naphthalene acetic acid\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x894.44\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M Benzyladenine was selected as the best combination to produce maximum fresh weight of callus. The CPT content of callus was estimated as 0.23\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.03\xc2\xa0mg/g DW. Friable calli produced were used to raise cell suspension cultures in half strength MS liquid medium, fortified with different concentrations of auxins. Maximum fresh weight was yielded by a medium supplemented with 16.12\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M Naphthalene acetic acid (14.64\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.03\xc2\xa0g). Highest CPT content was estimated in a medium supplemented with 10.74\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M Naphthalene acetic acid as 0.31\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.01\xc2\xa0mg/g DW. When compared with the CPT content of field plants, it was found to be higher.'

Abstract: 'Socioecology suggests that female distribution in space is determined by the distribution of food resources and the male distribution is influenced by female distribution. Though studies have traditionally focused on females, males have received increasing attention in recent years. We compared male\xe2\x80\x93male relationships in lion-tailed macaques and bonnet macaques. Because bonnet macaques have a high adult male:female sex ratio and are seasonal breeders whereas lion-tailed macaques have a low adult male:female sex ratio and are largely aseasonal breeders, we predicted that bonnet macaque males would be spatially and socially more tolerant of each other and would have less linear dominance relationships than lion-tailed macaques. We recorded male\xe2\x80\x93male and male\xe2\x80\x93female relationships in 1 group of wild macaques of each species via scan sampling and 1\xe2\x80\x930 sampling. The results revealed that lion-tailed macaque males largely remained at a distance from each other whereas bonnet macaque males remained in close proximity to one another. Lion-tailed macaque males were more agonistic toward each other whereas bonnet macaque males showed more affiliative interactions. The dominance hierarchy among lion-tailed macaque males was more linear than among bonnet macaque males. Our data support the hypothesis that the study of spatial structuring, temporality of interactions, and linearity of social relationships may contribute to a better understanding of macaque social systems.'

Abstract: 'Camptothecin (CPT), a monoterpene indole alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I and has applications in treating ovarian, small lung and refractory ovarian cancers. Stem wood tissue of Nothapodytes nimmoniana (Graham) Mabb. (family Icacinaceae) is one of the richest sources of CPT. Since there is no genomic or transcriptome data available for the species, the present work sequenced and analysed transcriptome of stem wood tissue on an Illumina platform. From a total of 77,55,978 reads, 9,187 transcripts were assembled with an average length of 255 bp. Functional annotation and categorization of these assembled transcripts unraveled the transcriptome architecture and also a total of 13 genes associated with CPT biosynthetic pathway were identified in the stem wood tissue. Four genes of the pathway were cloned to full length by RACE to validate the transcriptome data. Expression analysis of 13 genes associated with CPT biosynthetic pathway in 11 different tissues vis-\xc3\xa0-vis CPT content analysis suggested an important role of NnPG10H, NnPSLS and NnPSTR genes in the biosynthesis of CPT. These results indicated that CPT might be synthesized in the leaves and then perhaps exported to stem wood tissue for storage.'

Abstract: 'The present study aims the evaluation of bio-physical characteristics towards soil-water-vegetation stress and a rule is envisaged to assess the degree of temporal changes. The digital rule for assessment is initialized through the index of land Instability (ILI) where the variance indicates the temporal instability of the pixel i.e., smallest land unit. It is assumed that the biophysical characteristic of land is in command of land-dynamics where there is no change in Land Use/Land Cover (LU&LC). The intensity map on tendency of albedo (IALB) assesses the intensity of soil erosion and water stress whereas intensity map on tendency of NDVI (INDVI) appraises the stress on vegetation. The carry-out study covers a part of semiarid Western India. Primarily remote sensing technique, which carries the digital information of land temporally and spatially, is adopted in this paper. A part of the study area is represented using two sets of IRS 1A/1B LISS-I data of March with a decadal time domain (1989\xe2\x80\x931998) as a test area. It is assumed that the soil-water-vegetation stress is maximum during summer (March\xe2\x80\x93April\xe2\x80\x93May) in any tropical belt and decadal data will stretch the possibility of climate as well as man-made activity over the land.'

Abstract: 'According to ecological theory, the concept of niche differentiation is essential to our understanding of how sympatric species can limit competition over resources. We here examine ecological niche differentiation in 2 sympatric Asian langurs, Presbytis potenziani and Simias concolor, both endemic to the Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra. We collected data (home range size, canopy use, activity budgets, diet, and niche breadth and overlap) using GPS and scan/focal animal sampling methods on 2 groups of Presbytis potenziani and 3 groups of Simias concolor living in a mixed primary rain forest in northern Siberut. Results show that home ranges of the 2 species overlapped completely and that the home range size of Presbytis potenziani was ca. 4 times larger than that of Simias concolor. Lower canopy levels (<20\xc2\xa0m) were used more often by Simias concolor, whereas Presbytis potenziani preferred the canopy >20\xc2\xa0m. Apart from foraging and other activities, there was little difference in overall activity budgets of the 2 species. Regarding diet, although 60% of all food species examined were used by both langur species, they shared only 3 of the 10 most commonly eaten species. Presbytis potenziani fed more selectively on fruits, whereas Simias concolor fed predominantly on leaves. Levin\xe2\x80\x99s niche breadth indices revealed that the diet of Simias concolor is more general (0.34) than that of Presbytis potenziani (0.22). Based on a Pianka index of 0.32, we conclude that there is a relatively small food niche overlap between the 2 colobine species and that diet represents an important mechanism enabling their coexistence.'

These produced multiple shoots when transferred to multiplication medium consisting of 0.5 MS medium with 2.2 \xce\xbcM (0.5 mg\xc2\xb7l\xe2\x88\x921) BA, or microtubers when transferred to 0.5 MS medium with 22.2 \xce\xbcM (5 mg\xc2\xb7l\xe2\x88\x921) BA and 23.2 \xce\xbcM (5 mg\xc2\xb7l\xe2\x88\x921) kinetin.In vitro flowering occurred inC. jainii and not in the other two varieties when the plants were cultured on multiplication media with spermine at 0.25 \xce\xbcM (50 \xce\xbcg\xc2\xb7l\xe2\x88\x921) as an additive. Shoot pieces produced callus on MS medium with 9.05 \xce\xbcM (2 mg\xc2\xb7l\xe2\x88\x921) 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid. Regeneration of the calli by somatic embryogenesis was achieved when they were transferred to 0.5 MS medium with 2.2 \xce\xbcM (0.5 mg\xc2\xb7l\xe2\x88\x921) BA. Rooting of the shoots was possible both byin vitro andex vitro means.'

Abstract: 'The reservoir surveys carried out using the conventional equipments like theodolite, plane table, sextant, range finders, sounding rods, echo-sounders and slow moving boats etc. are time consuming and sometime it takes up to three years to complete the survey of a major reservoir like Hirakud. During such longtime of survey, the siltation pattern and the bed levels also get changed. So, the need to update the sediment measurement techniques and to introduce latest technology available in the field was felt to overcome the difficulties faced in the conventional method especially in major reservoirs. With this objective, the present study of the assessment of the sedimentation in Linganmakki reservoir is carried out using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The revised capacities in the zone of reservoir levels (533.05 \xe2\x80\x93 548.78 m) for the year 1989\xe2\x80\x931990 and 2001\xe2\x80\x932002 in the zone of 532.20 \xe2\x80\x93 545.91 m of reservoir levels were determined, which is found 2837.84 M cum and 2207.95 M cum respectively. Based on these results, the sedimentation rates in the zone (533.05 \xe2\x80\x93 548.78 m) come out to be 8.96 ham/100 km2/year and for the zone (532.20 \xe2\x80\x93 545.91 m) is 8.57 ha-m/100 km2/year. It is found that the results are comparable during and the uniform sediment rate of 8.57 ha-m/100 km2/ year can be considered.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82Impact of catchment erosion and the resultant reservoir siltation from a tropical environment is reported here to discuss the effect of a reservoir in the natural degradation of an evergreen-forested segment. While an area of 8.01\xe2\x80\x89km2 has been affected by direct inundation at the full reservoir level, another 2.6\xe2\x80\x89km2 area once under thick forest cover, had also lost its identity over the last 38 years by indirect degradation. This zone mainly falls in the confluence of tributaries, namely Neyyar and Mullayar, with the reservoir. The capacity of the reservoir was found to be reduced by 28.8\xe2\x80\x89Mm3 during this period and the annual average loss is calculated as 0.75\xe2\x80\x89Mm3 (0.71%), indicating the intensity of erosion from the catchment zone. In case the proposed upper dam in the reservoir comes into existence, an additional area of 2.4\xe2\x80\x89km2 from the virgin forest would be submerged and more area would face degradation around the inundated zone.'

Abstract: 'A new and interesting species of Sporidesmium was discovered during a survey of plant debris inhibiting litter decomposing microfungi in Binser forest, Almora, Uttarakhand, India. This new species, Sporidesmium binserum sp. nov., a dematiaceous  hyphomycete was found on decaying leaf litter of the host plant Quercus leucotrichophora (oak). The key features of special interest that distinguish it from other morphologically similar species of Sporidesmium are macronematous, mononematous, percurrent proliferations towards the end in the flexuous multiseptate conidiophores with obtuse tip having distinctively curved, fusiform to subfusiform, 3-septate conidia, consist of 3 cells, second cell dark brown with slightly or distinctly constricted at the septa, tip cell of conidia highly curved and/or twisted, mostly flat and conic-truncated ends at base due to schizolytic secession. The conidial maturation is presumably synchronous with conidial ontogeny. Based on these features, the specimen is proposed here as a new species. Apart from it, a note on the current status of Sporidesmium sensu lato in India is also provided.'

Abstract: 'The importance of water resources development for sustaining life and the agrarian economy under the conditions prevalent in India is brought out. The inadequacy of drinking water and irrigation facilities inspite of large investments under the various Plans is very disappointing, as also the poor development of the hydroelectric potential. Despite the rich environmental and natural resources of India, there has been very little developmental work due to various reasons, chief of them being non-involvement by specialized technologists in the areas where they matter most. The need for a scientific policy and a planned approach is emphasized so that higher employment generation and rapid economic growth can be achieved.'

Title: 'Analysis of intraspecific genetic variation in Musa balbisiana Colla from Meghalaya as revealed by Single Primer Amplification Reaction approach'
Author: 'Animos\xc2\xa0Lamare'

Abstract: 'The Indian subcontinent is considered to be the major centre of hybridization of the wild Musa progenies, as it forms the centre of secondary origin of the taxa and therefore expected to exhibit a high degree of diversity. Musa balbisiana Colla is known to be one of the wild progenitors of cultivated bananas and plantains. Knowledge of genetic variability is very important for contemplating any conservation and management programmes. Single Primer Amplification Reaction (SPAR) approach i.e., a combination of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and directed amplification of minisatellites DNA (DAMD) markers function as important tools for analyzing genetic variation in plants. They collectively provide a comprehensive description of the nature and the extent of existing natural genetic diversity, as the primers target different regions of the genome. A total of 47 SPAR primers (RAPD-25, ISSR-12 and DAMD-10) with high reproducibility were used for analysis of intraspecific genetic variation of the 12 genotypes of M. balbisiana, which yielded 331 polymorphic bands. The RAPD, ISSR and DAMD markers revealed 82.63\xc2\xa0%, 90.36\xc2\xa0% and 84.72\xc2\xa0% of polymorphic bands respectively. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values were almost identical for each marker system while the resolving power (Rp) was found to be highest in DAMD (4.10). The dendrogram obtained showed the presence of two main clusters in all the analyses, with some genotypes (MB10-MB11 and MB5-MB7) always maintaining and manifesting their strong genetic relationship by clustering together\xc2\xa0in almost all the analyses.\xc2\xa0Combinations of such markers can be considered as more effective and promising tool for assessing genetic variation in other Musa species as well.'

Abstract: 'The Nawarangpur district, Orissa, a trop ical region with Sal mixed moist deciduous and Sal mixed dry deciduous forests, has been affected by extensive deforestation. The district was surveyed using Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) satellite imagery. From 1973 to 1990, more than 888.6\xc2\xa0km2 of dense forest (rate of deforestation = 3.62) and from 1990 to 2004, 429.7\xc2\xa0km2 (rate of deforestation = 3.97) were found to have been deforested. The analysis of results identified the reduction in area of dense forest and increase of agricultural land, degraded areas of abandoned agricultural land and unproductive scrub. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. From this study it can be concluded that temporal changes and the factors affecting these changes should be determined for sustainable management of natural resources.'

Abstract: 'In this study the regional earth system model RegCM-ES is applied over the South Asia CORDEX domain to improve the simulation of the variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon. RegCM-ES has been integrated for 30 years, from 1979 to 2008, with a spatial resolution of 50\xc2\xa0km in the atmospheric component, 18\xc2\xa0km in the ocean and 50 or 12\xc2\xa0km in the two hydrological models used for this study. A new hydrological component, the Cetemps Hydrological Model (CHyM), is included in the coupled system composed by the regional climate model RegCM4 and the ocean model MITgcm. In our analysis we show how the two way air\xe2\x80\x93sea feedback simulated by the coupled system largely improves the representation of intraseasonal (ISV) and interannual (IAV) modes of variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR). The comparison with the Hydrological Discharge (HD) model shows large improvements in simulating the correct amount of freshwater river discharge over the Bay of Bengal (BoB), one of the fundamental factor responsible for the formation of the shallow barrier layer (BL) over the BoB. However, the improvements in river discharge do not have a clear effect on the BL due to excessive mixing in the ocean model. The improvements in the simulation of IAV are primarily due to the ability of RegCM-ES to reproduce the Intraseasonal Oscillation modes and to the complex mechanism related to the delayed response of the ISMR to the ENSO forcing. Our results highlight the very important role of fine scale air\xe2\x80\x93sea feedbacks in modulating the ISMR and the internal dynamics of this phenomenon.'

Abstract: 'Most community forests in hill regions of northeast India have been managed by traditional local institutions for centuries and most of these institutions remain functional even today. Higher forest coverage on private and community lands as compared to government land indicates that traditional institutions effectively manage community forests in the region. The present study was conducted through a survey of literature and field work using participatory research tools viz., PRA exercises, group discussions and questionnaire interviews with key informants in northeast India. We categorized the institutions involved in conservation and management of forests into three major types: traditional, quasi-traditional and modern. Traditional institutions with hierarchal structure were found in all states and are intact and functional in the state of Meghalaya. Quasi-traditional institutions, a blend of traditional and modern institutions were prevalent in Nagaland while modern institutions have almost replaced traditional institutions in Mizoram. We recorded at least eleven types of community forests viz., group of village forest, village forest, restricted forest, sacred forest, clan forest, cemetery forest, regeneration forest, bamboo forest, recreation forest, village reserved forest and medicinal plantation in villages of three states. The tribal people, through long-term trial and error experiments, have developed an elaborate, functional and generally democratic system of conservation and management of forests and associated natural ecosystems. Several forest and natural resource management lessons can be learnt from the institutional structure and decision making system of the evolving and dynamic institutions of tribal communities of the region.'

Title: 'Effects of forest fragmentation on Heliconia acuminata seedling recruitment in central Amazonia'

Abstract: ' I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent 5,000\xc2\xa0m2 demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was 1.5\xe2\x80\x936 times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were 3\xe2\x80\x937 times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts.'

Abstract: 'Dam removal has been increasingly reported globally and is becoming an important approach for river management, restoration and environmental conservation in damming rivers. However, current limited knowledge of global trends in dam removal and related research may be potentially biased in terms of the geographic distribution and organisms studied. Such bias could mislead dam removal planning and management in different areas and ecological conservation for different taxa. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed datasets of dam removal and publications of dam removal research using bibliometric methods. A total of 1449 dam removal documents were published from 1953 to 2016. Trends, current hotspots and future directions of dam removal research were identified. The results from this study reveal that dam removal largely occurred in the North America and Europe, and most of the removed dams were small and old dams. With respect to the topic analysis, more dam removal studies should focus on the responses of a wide range of organisms, not only fish, as well as the interspecies relationships, food webs and ecosystem structures and functions. Based on our findings, we also provide some suggestions for future dam removal planning and analysis.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing, a state of art technology has gained significance due to its capability to map and monitor compositional, structural and functional biodiversity. Remote sensing data provides a perspective on how ecosystems and species are being affected by the multiple disturbances. This paper presents consolidated information of earth observation based biodiversity research and conservation applications in India. Progress achieved for understanding essential biodiversity variables with reference to species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure have been reviewed. Studies mostly focused on remote sensing based biodiversity indicators in understanding of land cover, forest cover, forest type, fragmentation, biological richness, carbon stocks, fires and protected area monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Fine resolution understanding with reference to vegetation structure, function, distribution of threatened, endemic and invasive species is required for effective conservation strategies. The declining trend of deforestation and effectiveness of protected area network indicates India\xe2\x80\x99s commitment towards the global conservation targets. Ensured continuity of remote sensing can support in near real monitoring of habitats and achieving conservation effectiveness.'

Abstract: 'Soil seed banks that persist after a fire are important in fire-prone habitats as they minimise the risk of decline or local extinction in plants, should the fire-free interval be less than the primary juvenile periods of the species. In two common woody plant genera (Acacia and Grevillea) in southeastern Australia, we examined the size and location of the residual seed bank after fire across areas of varying seedling densities at three locations in comparison to the distribution of seeds in the soil at an unburnt site. We found viable dormant seeds remaining in the soil after fire (evidence of residual soil seed bank). A significantly lower proportion of seeds remained in the top 5\xc2\xa0cm of soil than at 5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm or 10\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0cm soil depths, independent of seedling density or plant genus. This was due to greater germination, and possibly some seed mortality, near the soil surface. Reduced germination below 5\xc2\xa0cm was probably due to the reduced efficacy of the fire cues that break seed dormancy, a declining ability of seeds to emerge successfully from such depths, and the lower abundance of seeds in the soil at such depths. The magnitude of the residual seed bank was similar across 0\xe2\x80\x935, 5\xe2\x80\x9310 and 10\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0cm soil depths in Acacia suaveolens. For two Grevillea species, most residual seeds were at 0\xe2\x80\x935 and 5\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm. The residual soil seed bank in the top 10\xc2\xa0cm of soil after fire varied across sites with estimates of 0, 19 and 27% in G. speciosa and 23, 35, and 55% in A. suaveolens. At two sites, both species had similar residual seed bank sizes, while at a third, there were large differences between the species (0\xe2\x80\x9355%). The observed patterns imply that the fire-related cues that break seed dormancy generally declined with soil depth. For Acacia, seed dormancy is broken by heat shock, a fire-cue that declines with soil depth. Some 250 species (approx 15% of the fire-prone flora) in the region are thought to have dormancy broken by heat shock. For Grevillea, where seed dormancy is broken by the interaction of smoke and heat shock, at two sites, we suggest three possibilities: (i) the smoke cue declined with soil depth; (ii) both heat and smoke are obligatory for breaking seed dormancy; or (iii) the cues may be independent and additive and below the zone of soil heating, only a proportion of available seeds had dormancy broken by smoke alone. At a third site (no residual seed bank detected) the smoke cue was predicted not to have declined with soil depth. Up to 900 species (just under half the fire-prone flora) in the study region are thought to have seed dormancy broken by the interaction of heat and smoke during the passage of a fire.'

Abstract: 'The present study is undertaken to analyse the genetic diversity of Roscoea procera Wall. (an endemic Himalayan medicinal herb) collected from 11 different populations of West Himalaya using ISSR markers. Of the total 130 ISSR primers screened, only ten ISSR primers generated 94 clear and reproducible banding patterns, of which 89 bands (94.68\xc2\xa0%) were polymorphic. Based on the percentage of polymorphic loci (94.68\xc2\xa0%), Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (0.198) and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s information index (0.329), high genetic diversity was detected at the species level. Genetic differentiation (G ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.202) was also recorded as moderate level due to high gene flow (Nm\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.976) among populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that most of the genetic variation (90\xc2\xa0%) resided within the populations (\xce\xa6 ST\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.10). STRUCTURE analysis revealed two ancestral groups of the species, which were further supported by neighbour-joining cluster analysis. Among the different ecological habitats, high genetic diversity in populations under open grassy land showed suitability and preferred habitat conditions. High genetic diversity within population suggests in situ and ex situ conservation of selected populations for conserving and maintaining wide genetic pool of the species.'

Abstract: 'All orchids maintain an obligate relationship with mycorrhizal symbionts during seed germination. In most cases, germination-enhancing fungi have been isolated from roots of mature plants for conservation and cultivation purposes. To understand the germination biology of Dendrobium devonianum, an over-collected medicinal orchid, the seeds of D. devonianum were inoculated with a fungal strain (FDd1) isolated from naturally occurring protocorms of D. devonianum and two other germination-enhancing fungal strains (FDaI7 and FCb4) from D. aphyllum and Cymbidium mannii, respectively. The fungal strain was isolated from five protocorms of D. devonianum and identified as a species of the genus Epulorhiza. In germination trials, treatments with all of the three fungal strains showed a significant promoting effect on seed germination and protocorm formation, compared with the control treatment (no inoculation). However, FDd1 fungal strain showed the greatest effectiveness followed by FDaI7 and FCb4. For all inoculation and control treatments, seeds developed to protocorms regardless of the presence of illumination, whereas protocorms did not develop to seedlings unless illumination was provided. The results of our manipulative experiments confirmed the hypothesis that mycorrhizae associated with orchid seedlings are highly host-specific, and the degree of specificity may be life stagespecific under in vitro conditions. The specific mycorrhizal symbionts from protocorms can enhance restoration efforts and the conservation of orchids such as D. devonianum.'

Abstract: 'There is a growing evidence that the climate change do has implications for drought vulnerable India with studies projecting future possible reductions in monsoon related rainfall in the country. The existing drought risk mitigation and response mechanisms were looked into and gaps were identified by drawing lessons from previous disasters and response mechanisms. In absence of reliable climate predictions at the scales that make them useful for policy level planning, the emphasis was on identifying no-regret adaptation options those would reduce current vulnerabilities while mainstreaming the adaptation in the long run. The most notable climate change implications for the drought vulnerable India are the enhanced preparedness with due emphasis to the community based preparedness planning, reviewing the existing monsoon and drought prediction methodologies, and establishing drought monitoring and early warning systems in association with a matching preparedness at the input level.'

Abstract: ' Healing Animals, Feeding Souls: Ethnobotanical Values at Sacred Sites in Central Italy. Ethnobotanical knowledge is a fundamental repository of the values and applications of different plants. This knowledge is often related to spiritual beliefs and religious sites, where plants have been nurtured and conserved for their use in rituals and traditional practices. While this link is well known for different areas of the global south, it has hardly been investigated in relatively more secular and modernized Western contexts. Here, we use first\xe2\x80\x93hand vegetation surveys and published records to examine the occurrence of ethnobotanical values at 30 Catholic shrines in Central Italy, and compare them with an equal number of non\xe2\x80\x93sacred control sites. We ask this: to what extent is there an association of useful plants with sacred places in Italy, as found in other cultural contexts? We show that a greater number of useful plants are found at sacred sites. While this is mainly a consequence of the higher species richness of sacred sites, an association with plants used in animal husbandry is particularly evident, and likely related to the deep historical connection between sacred places and pastoralist traditions in Central Italy. Also, we show that there are significant variations in the distribution of old trees; the largest specimens are found at the center of sacred sites, while tree size visibly decreases away from the shrines. This indicates also that individual trees have been actively managed and conserved at sacred sites, probably driven by the symbolic values that old trees frequently embody.'

Abstract: 'The comparative assessment of genetic diversity using allozymes, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and microsatellite markers was conducted in endemic and endangered yellow catfish (Horabagrus brachysoma) sampled from three locations in Western Ghats river systems of India. Among the three markers, microsatellites show more polymorphism, having 100% polymorphic loci, whereas allozymes show the least (56%). In RAPD, 60.5% of fragments were polymorphic. Observed heterozygosity and F ST values were very high in microsatellites, compared with the other markers. Microsatellite and RAPD markers reported a higher degree of genetic differentiation than allozymes among the populations depicted by pairwise F ST/G ST, AMOVA, Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic distance, and UPGMA dendrogram. The three classes of markers demonstrated striking genetic differentiation between pairs of H. brachysoma populations. The data emphasize the need for fishery management, conservation, and rehabilitation of this species.'

Abstract: 'A morphometric analysis of Shanur basin has been carried out using geoprocessing techniques in GIS. These techniques are found relevant for the extraction of river basin and its drainage networks. The extracted drainage network was classified according to Strahler\xe2\x80\x99s system of classification and it reveals that the terrain exhibits dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern. Hence, from the study, it is concluded that remote sensing data (SRTM\xe2\x80\x93DEM data of 30\xc2\xa0m resolution) coupled with geoprocessing techniques prove to be a competent tool used in morphometric analysis and evaluation of linear, slope, areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters. The combined outcomes have established the topographical \nand even recent developmental situations in basin. It will also change the setup of the region. It therefore needs to analyze high level parameters of drainage and environment for suitable planning and management of water resource developmental plan and land resource development plan. The Shanur drainage basin is sprawled over an area of 281.33\xc2\xa0km2. The slope of the basin varies from 1 to 10\xc2\xa0%, and the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. The main stream length ratio of the basin is 14.92 indicating that the study area is elongated with moderate relief and steep slopes. The morphometric parameters of the stream have been analyzed and calculated by applying standard methods and techniques viz. Horton (Trans Am Geophys Union 13:350\xe2\x80\x93361, 1945), Miller (A quantitative geomorphologic study of drainage basin characteristics in the clinch mountain area, Virginia and Tennessee Columbia University, Department of Geology, Technical Report, No. 3, Contract N6 ONR 271\xe2\x80\x93300, 1953), and Strahler (Handbook of applied hydrology, McGraw Hill Book Company, New York, 1964). GIS based on analysis of all morphometric parameters and the erosional development of the area by the streams has been progressed well beyond maturity and lithology is an influence in the drainage development. These studies are very useful for planning of rainwater harvesting and watershed management.'

Abstract: ' Garcinia gummi-gutta (L.) Roxb. (Clusiaceae) is an endemic, semidomesticated, fruit-yielding tree species distributed in the Western Ghats of India and Sri Lanka. Various bioactive phytochemicals, such as garcinol, benzophenones and xanthones are isolated from G. gummi-gutta and have shown antibacterial, antiviral and antioxidant activities. We sequenced the total genomic DNA using Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform and examined 241,141,804 bp high quality data, assembled into 773,889 contigs. In these contigs, 27,313 simple-sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified, among which mononucleotide repeats were predominant (44.98%) followed by dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats. Primers were designed for 9964 microsatellites among which 32 randomly selected SSR primer pairs were standardized for amplification. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA in 30 G. gummi-gutta genotypes revealed polymorphic information content (PIC) across all 32 loci ranging from 0.867 to 0.951, with a mean value of 0.917. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.00 to 0.63 and 0.896 to 0.974, respectively. Alleles per locus ranged from 12 to 27. This is the first report on the development of genomic SSR markers in G. gummi-gutta using next-generation sequencing technology. The genomic SSR markers developed in this study will be useful in identification, mapping, diversity and breeding studies.'

Abstract: 'The study examines long-term land use/land cover change (LUCC) at a finer scale in a semi-arid region of India. The objectives were to study and quantify the spatiotemporal LUCC and uncover the major drivers causing the change in the Mula Pravara river basin, which is located in a semi-arid region of Maharashtra state, India. Advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 3g data for the years 1982\xe2\x80\x932015 were used to identify the \xe2\x80\x98hotspot\xe2\x80\x99 with significant positive and negative LUCC. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery was used to produce finer scale land use maps. From 1991 to 2016, the agricultural land area increased by approximately 98% due to the conversion of uncultivable and fallow lands to agriculture. The built-up area increased by 195%, and in recent years, an urban expansion has occurred in agricultural lands close to the urban fringe areas. There has been a shift from food crops to commercial crops, as observed from the steep increase in the amount of land under horticultural plantations, by 1601% from 2001 to 2016. In addition, the area under forest canopy was reduced in the protected regions. Institutional factors that improved access to water resources were the major drivers of change in hotspots, especially in the context of agriculture. Technological and economic factors were the other supporting factors that contributed to the change. This study demonstrates the advantages of using satellite remote sensing techniques to monitor the LUCC, which is useful for predicting future land changes and aids in planning adaptation strategies.'

Abstract: 'In recent years, the Taiwanese government has strongly promoted the concept of ecological engineering in the hope that doing so will encourage the maintenance of the ecosystem and its integrity. As a result, the riprap spur dike is one of the most commonly used measures for protecting stream banks. Traditionally, a spur dike is used at concave banks to prevent their scouring and/or to increase their stabilization. An additional benefit of deflector structures, like spur dikes, may be to increase the weighted usable area (WUA) for aquatic life survival during periods of increased flow (examples include typhoon, flood, etc.). A two-dimensional river habitat simulation program (River2D) coupled with a developed shallow water habitat type diversity module was used for the case study at a headwater stream in central Taiwan. The habitat suitability index for this study was established using substrate, depth, and velocity from field surveys for the fish family Cyprinidae by prepositioned area electrofisher. The ungauged flood conditions were calculated using digital elevation models within a watershed delineation and hydrological modeling system in accordance with local regulations. Simulated results indicate that the spur dikes currently in use on the stream in this study need be improved from a WUA point of view more effectively handle a flood event.'

Abstract: 'Sri Lanka is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. This study has utilized satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques to generate a nation-wide database on forests, forest types and land use/land cover of Sri Lanka. Spatial assessment of forest cover changes was carried out for the periods 1976\xe2\x80\x931985, 1985\xe2\x80\x931994, 1994\xe2\x80\x932005 and 2005\xe2\x80\x932014. The landscape fragmentation analysis has carried out to calculate the spatial and temporal patterns of forest. Land use/land cover map was prepared representing seven classes in 2014. The plantations occupy a large area (34.2%) followed by forests (33.4%) and agriculture (26.1%) in 2014. During the period of 1976\xe2\x80\x932014, the forest has been decreased by 5.5%. From 1976 to 1985 forest recorded a loss at an annual rate of 0.49%. This annual rate decreased to 0.01% during 2005\xe2\x80\x932014 indicates declining trend of deforestation and effective conservation measures. The study found deforestation hotspots in south east and northern most parts of the Sri Lanka. Total number of patches estimated has increased from 15193 in 1976 to 16136 in 2014. The study has found that main causes of deforestation in Sri Lanka were due to expansion of agriculture and plantations. The extent of change detected in the study through geospatial techniques has significance to the forest ecology and management of natural landscapes in Sri Lanka.'

Abstract: 'Patches and their boundaries are sensitive to the scale at which they are viewed. The response of species to patchiness may depend on the resolution and on the extent by which the spatial pattern is perceived. The goal of this paper is to identify the scale at which forest spatial pattern causes changes in species richness and abundances of Dipteran and Homopteran species as a whole, and further on their distinctive ecological functional groups. Using remotely-sensed optical imagery, we described the landscape structure surrounding sampling sites. We used two approaches to deal with the problem of the scale of observation: 1) variation of extent using a multiscale analysis, and 2) comparison of two satellite sensors with different spatial resolutions (SPOT: 20 \xc3\x97 20 m, and Landsat TM: 30 \xc3\x97 30 m). The relationship between entomological data and landscape descriptors at different spatial scales was tested with the Mantel test, redundancy analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Relative abundances of Homopteran species were affected by landscape patterns at finer scales than in Diptera. The strength of response to landscape was different for each Dipteran functional group. The multiscale analysis also enabled the optimal scale (6.25 ha) of landscape pattern, accounting for 62% of the variation in Homopteran richness, to be identified. As a practical application, Homopteran richness was mapped by extrapolation of the regression function to the pixels of the image. Multiscale analysis provides an alternative view of fragmentation effects, which are traditionally studied through the patch-based approach, and highlights the importance of scale in ecological processes. The detection of optimal scales and the use of satellite images enable maps of important biotic indicators to be drawn up.'

Abstract: 'Species endemic to sky island systems are isolated to mountain peaks and high elevation plateaux both geographically and ecologically, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Pressures associated with climate change have already been linked to local extinctions of montane species, emphasizing the importance of understanding the genetic diversity and population connectivity within sky islands systems for the conservation management of remaining populations. Our study focuses on the endangered alpine skink Pseudemoia cryodroma, which is endemic to the Victorian Alps in south-eastern Australia, and has a disjunct distribution in montane habitats above 1100\xc2\xa0m a.s.l. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite loci, we investigated species delimitation, genetic connectivity and population genetic structure across the geographic range of this species. We found discordance between genetic markers, indicating historical mtDNA introgression at one of the study sites between P. cryodroma and the closely related, syntopic P. entrecasteauxii. Molecular diversity was positively associated with site elevation and extent of suitable habitat, with inbreeding detected in three of the five populations. These results demonstrate the complex interaction between geography and habitat in shaping the population structure and genetic diversity of P. cryodroma, and highlight the importance of minimising future habitat loss and fragmentation for the long-term persistence of this species.'

Title: 'Local perceptions about forests and water in two tropical catchments'

Abstract: "This study was performed to assess how local inhabitants in two tropical watersheds value forests and perceive both forests and their own capacity to influence the hydrological cycle. Both service and productivity functions were strongly valued, particularly forests' rain-bringing capacity. The view that forests are directly responsible for increased precipitation was especially strong in low rainfall areas. Forests were also seen as important for their ability to retain soil water. The human activity most often mentioned as affecting water availability was tree planting while water conservation structures were not seen as detrimentally affecting others. Water was pictured very strongly as being part of a cycle so that which is used by humans or trees is not considered lost but only displaced to return again as rain."

Abstract: 'Quantification of fruit fall is the only way to compare fruit food availability among different studies. This study aims to reveal the general characteristics of fruit fall in temperate forests, which should offer indispensable information for using fruit fall data as food availability for frugivores. Fruit fall in three warm-temperate and two cool-temperate forests on Yakushima, an island in southwestern Japan, were studied for two years in one cool-temperate plot of 50 m \xc3\x97 50 m in size and for four years in other plots of 100 m \xc3\x97 50 m in size. The elevations of the plots ranged 170\xe2\x80\x931200 m a.s.l. Fruit fall was highest in the lowland forests (599 and 564 DW kg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7year\xe2\x88\x921 and lowest in the mid-elevation forest (198 DW kg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7year\xe2\x88\x921). Fleshy fruits and food-fruits for Japanese macaques constituted 3\xe2\x80\x9337% and 4\xe2\x80\x9387% of the total fruit fall, respectively. When only fleshy-fruit fall was compared, it was higher in the western lowland forest (222 DW kg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7year\xe2\x88\x921) than in any other forests (9\xe2\x80\x9366 DW kg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7year\xe2\x88\x921). The pulp of fleshy fruits, presumably the edible parts for frugivores, was only 1.1\xe2\x80\x9312.7% of the total fruit fall. The edible parts for Japanese macaques constituted 3\xe2\x80\x9354% of the fruit fall, showing a high value where acorns are abundant. Half of the fruit-fall biomass consisted of only one or two nonfleshy-fruited species, which are usually dominant in many other temperate forests, such as Quercus and conifers. These variations agreed with the variations in occurrence of frugivorous (such as Japanese macaques).'

Abstract: 'In the present study, an attempt has been made to characterize the biophysical land units in Kanholi bara river basin of sub-humid tropical ecosystem of central India using remotely sensed data, field surveys and GIS based multi-criteria overlay analysis. The geo-spatial database on elevation, slope, landforms, soil depth, soil erosion, land use/land cover and hydrogeomorphological parameters has been generated using IRS-ID LISS-III satellite data coupled with soil survey data in GIS. The methodology followed in characterization of biophysical land units in GIS includes assigning scores for different classes of the layers and weighatges for different layers based on their characteristics and degree of influence on desired output. GIS based \xe2\x80\x98multi criteria overlay\xe2\x80\x99 analysis reveals seventeen distinct biophysical land units in the river basin. Severe (50.5-59.5) to very severe (59.5) biophysical stress units are found in plateau spurs, isolated mounds, linear ridges, dissected plateau and escarpments. These zones are associated with severe to very severe erosion, steep to very steep, extremely shallow soils, poor to very poor groundwater prospects, wastelands and scrublands. The characterization of biophysical land units helps in analysis of their potentials, problems and stress environment to plan and execute site-specific landscape management practices and maximize the productivity from each biophysical land unit. The present study demonstrates that generation of geo-spatial database based on remotely sensed data and field surveys in GIS and their analysis helps great extent in characterization of biophysical land units and analysis of their stress environment for management.'

Abstract: 'The Arabian Peninsula is home to a unique fauna that has assembled and evolved throughout the course of major geophysical events, including the separation of the Arabian Plate from Africa and subsequent collision with Eurasia. Opportunities for faunal exchanges with particular continents occurred in temporally distinct periods, and the presence of African, Western Eurasian, and South Asian derived taxa on the Arabian Peninsula signifies the complexity of these historical biogeographic events. The six true toad species (family Bufonidae) endemic to the Arabian Peninsula present a considerable taxonomic and biogeographic challenge because they are part of a global bufonid radiation, including several genera surrounding the Arabian Peninsula, and difficult to discriminate morphologically. As they could be derived from African, Western Eurasian, or South Asian toad groups, elucidating their evolutionary relationships has important implications for historical biogeography. Here, we analyze a global molecular data set of 243 bufonid lineages, with an emphasis on new sampling from the Horn of Africa, Western Eurasia, South Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula, to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of the Arabian species. We produce a robust time-calibrated phylogeny to infer the biogeographic history of this group on and around the Arabian Peninsula.'

Abstract: 'The Dipterocarpaceae are a globally significant family of tropical timber trees. They are especially dominant in lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, but have a pan tropical distribution. Vateriopsis seychellarum is the sole representative of this family on the Seychelles. Historically one of the dominant canopy trees on Mah\xc3\xa9, extensive overexploitation of this species for its timber has led to its virtual extinction. The last individuals of this species are found in small fragmented populations at lower altitudes (up to 400\xc2\xa0m) on the island of Mah\xc3\xa9 where the total number of known reproductive adults is 112. We developed ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for this species to enable us to quantify the levels of diversity in remnant populations and to study genetic structure and contemporary gene flow. In addition we tested for cross amplification of these alleles in the closely related but geographically disjunct species Vateria indica. In Vateriopsis seychellarum the number of alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 20 (mean of 11.4 per locus) with an average polymorphic information content of 0.73 across loci. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.40 to 0.71 with 3 of the 10 loci showing deviation from Hardy\xe2\x80\x93Weinberg expectations. 8 of the 10 primers showed cross amplification in Vateria indica. These markers will help to provide a better understanding of the significance of historic distributions, gene flow and recent anthropogenic habitat degradation for the survival of widespread species in recently fragmented landscapes.'

Abstract: 'The complete mitochondrial genome of the endangered fish Tor malabaricus, (Malabar mahseer) was sequenced for the first time. The mitochondrial genome size was determined to be 16580\xc2\xa0bp in length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and a control region (D-loop). The overall base composition was A: 31.88%, T: 24.87%, G: 15.68% and C: 27.58%. The phylogenetic analysis of 13 protein-coding genes of available mitogenome of mahseer species showed that the T. malabaricus had closer relationship to the black mahseer T. khudree. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of T. malabaricus would contribute to the better understanding of molecular systematics, selection, conservation, species identification and evolution of this species.'

Abstract: "Recent reports have suggested that a global decline in amphibian populations has taken place during the past few decades. Urban development is thought to affect the richness and abundances of species and, therefore, could be an important cause of decline. We estimated the richness and abundances of anurans in wetlands at a residential development and in similar wetlands at a nearby undeveloped park. The residential development originally was pine flatwoods habitat, as is the undeveloped park curiently. We also compared the anuran species' composition of the park in 1992 with the composition in 1974."

Abstract: 'The most significant large-scale environmental challenge that many countries, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world, will face in the middle and long-term are water scarcity problems, which are attributed to climate change impacts such as temperature increase, abundance of high solar radiation, and aridity in addition to population pressure. In many countries, current water resources use already exceeds sustainable and renewable supply. Various methodologies are suggested to increase the sources of water supply, among which one of the alternatives is rainwater and runoff harvesting (ROH). Water scarcity and additional stress are among the most specific problems in arid and semi-arid regions, where vegetation cover is very weak under extensive solar irradiation effects with high evaporation rates. Present global warming, climate change impacts, and their future patterns are expected to cause increase in the evapotranspiration rates and hence reduction in the groundwater recharges. Under such circumstances, any simple but effective water storage augmentation facility as the artificial groundwater recharge gains vital importance for sustainability of water supply and survivals in desert ecosystems. Although intensive and frequent rainfall events are rare they generate significant surface water flow during occasional floods and especially flash floods with huge amounts of surface water. It is, therefore, necessary to enhance artificial groundwater recharge from consequent frequent runoffs through suitable hydraulic structures. This paper aims at assessing the importance of ROH systems for domestic supply in arid regions with specific reference to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this purpose, it presents ROH from the surface flows in depressions of Quaternary wadi deposits in arid and semi-arid regions.'

Abstract: '\nIn cashew plantations of south west Karnataka, India, foraging activity of 49 ants species belonging to 24 genera and 7 subfamilies were recorded. The study found that ants visited cashew trees regularly throughout the year. Myrmicinae ants were most dominant comprising 22 species followed by Formicinae with 13 species while, among Aenictinae and Dorylinae, only single species was found. Species richness was high in old cashew plantations recording 89.8\xc2\xa0% of total species, while medium and young plantations recorded only 46.9 and 24.5\xc2\xa0%. Dominance of different ant species was noticed on cashew canopy, trunk and soil in different aged cashew plantations. Old cashew plantations were characterized by Oecophylla smaragdina, followed by Anoplolepis gracillipes, while, Camponotus compressus and C. sericeus were dominant in young and medium aged plantations. Pit fall trap collection consisted mostly of Odontomachus haematodus, Lophomyrmex quadrispinosus, Technomyrmex albipes, Myrmicaria brunnea, Diacamma sp., C. compressus and C. sericeus. During flowering and fruiting period of cashew, foraging of up to 10 ant species was seen on the same tree at a time. Activities of most ant species were predominant during winter and summer which coincides with flowering and fruiting period of cashew (December\xe2\x80\x93May), while during heavy down pour of south west monsoon, activities of only 10 species were seen. A significant positive correlation was found between number of ant species and maximum air temperature (0.842) and also with afternoon soil temperature (0.925).'

Abstract: 'Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is an important medicinal plant from the Western Ghats of India, traditionally used in treatment of various gynecological disorders. Increasing commercial demand and decreasing numbers has resulted in this plant becoming endangered with crude drug materials being extensively substituted/adulterated with other plant species. The present study was undertaken with the objective of development and evaluation of multivariate cluster analysis of ISSR fingerprints against rbcL-based DNA barcodes as tool to understand the relationships and to differentiate common adulterants and substituents from S. asoca. ISSR-based Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was carried out on 41 samples of S. asoca and 5 each of the 5 common substituent/adulterant plants and the clustering patterns were evaluated against DNA-sequence-based barcoding of rbcL region of their plastids. Factorial analysis and Principal Coordinate Analysis revealed distinct groups of genetic pools of respective taxa thereby confirming the utility of ISSR fingerprinting as a useful tool for differentiation between the genuine and the adulterants/substituents. NCBI-BLAST search on DNA barcode rbcL region confirmed the results of ISSR assays. Therefore, our study demonstrated the utility of simple, cost-effective method of ISSR fingerprinting coupled with rbcL barcoding in differentiating this important medicinal plant from its common adulterants/substituents.'

Abstract: 'Landscape ecologists typically identify boundaries to demarcate habitatpatches. The boundary between two habitat types may be abrupt, such as thetransition between a grassland and a parking lot, or more gradual, such as theshift between successional forest stages. Two key aspects of landscapeboundaries, their shape and contrast, are predicted to influence movement ofmaterials, plants, and animals. Ecological theory suggests that a patch\xe2\x80\x99sperimeter-to-area ratio should strongly influence animal emigration when patchboundaries are relatively permeable, but not when boundaries are more severe.Weinvestigated the interactive effects of patch shape and boundary contrast onmovement of ground-dwelling beetles (Carabidae and Tenebrionidae) in nativegrassland habitat at Jepson Prairie, Solano County, California, USA. Weconducted a field experiment with two patch shape treatments, square andrectangle, that held patch area constant, and two boundary contrast treatmentscreated by mowing grass surrounding each plot at two different heights. Wemonitored the number of beetles leaving each patch over a three-week periodfollowing treatment establishment. We observed a significant effect of boundarycontrast on net movement of beetles, with low contrast boundaries exhibitingnetimmigration and high contrast boundaries experiencing net emigration. Moreover,the importance of patch shape appeared to be greater for low contrast versushigh contrast boundaries, consistent with theoretical expectations. Ourcombinedobservations indicate that these ground-dwelling beetles were more likely tomove into patches that were rectangular and surrounded by a low contrast matrixthan patches that were square or surrounded by a high contrast matrix. Weconclude that net movement of beetles across patch boundaries is stronglyinfluenced by boundary contrast and may be affected by patch shape whenboundarycontrast is low.'

Abstract: 'Random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers were developed and used for the analysis of genetic variability in the critically endangered yellow catfish Horabagrus nigricollaris, sampled from the Chalakkudy River, Kerala, India. Eight RAPD and five microsatellite markers were detected to genotype the species. In RAPD, the 73 fragments were 20.55% polymorphic, whereas 4 polymorphic loci (80%) were obtained in microsatellites. In microsatellites, the number of alleles across the 5 loci was 1\xe2\x80\x935, and the range of heterozygosity was 0.25\xe2\x80\x930.5. The mean observed number of alleles was 2.4, and the effective number was 1.775 per locus. The average heterozygosity across all investigated samples was 0.29, indicating a significant deficiency of heterozygotes in this species. RAPD and microsatellite methods report a low degree of gene diversity and lack of genetic heterogeneity in the population of H. nigricollaris, emphasizing the need for fishery management, conservation, and rehabilitation of this species.'

Abstract: 'Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is the largest and the most diverse mountain region in the world that provides ecosystem services to one fifth of the total world population. The forests are fragmented to different degrees due to expansion and intensification of human land use. However, the quantitative relationship between fragmentation and demography has not been established before for HKH vis-\xc3\xa0-vis along elevation gradient. We used the globally available tree canopy cover data derived from Landsat-TM satellite to find out the decadal forest cover change over 2000 to 2010 and their corresponding fragmentation levels. Using SRTM-derived DEM, we observed high forest cover loss up to 2400 m that highly corroborated with the population distribution pattern as derived from satellite observation. In general, forest cover loss was found to be higher in south-eastern part of HKH. Forest fragmentation obtained using \xe2\x80\x98area-weighted mean radius of gyration\xe2\x80\x99 as indicator, was found to be very high up to 2400 m that also corroborated with high human population for the year 2000 and 2010. We observed logarithmic decrease in fragmentation change (area-weighted mean radius of gyration value), forest cover loss and population growth during 2000-2010 along the elevation gradient with very high R2 values (i.e., 0.889, 0.895, 0.944 respectively). Our finding on the pattern of forest fragmentation and human population across the elevation gradient in HKH region will have policy level implication for different nations and would help in characterizing hotspots of change. Availability of free satellite derived data products on forest cover and DEM, grid-data on demography, and utility of geospatial tools helped in quick evaluation of the forest fragmentation vis-a-vis human impact pattern along the elevation gradient in HKH.'

Abstract: 'Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllusLam.) Diversity in Bangladesh: Land Use and Artificial Selection. Bangladesh is often recognized as a secondary center of diversity for jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) and is expected to harbor important genetic diversity of this underutilized tree crop. Unfortunately, genetic erosion is occurring before this rich local resource has been documented and utilized for potential crop improvement. The aim of this study was to carry out a village-based survey and make morphological measurements to document and assess jackfruit diversity across trees associated with a gradient of three locations/habitats (homesteads, public lands, and forest or fallow lands). We also tested the hypotheses that cultivated jackfruit found in homesteads exhibited positive selection pressure for characteristics desirable in the market, and that the tree location reflected its history of origin and human selection. This was accomplished using 28 standardized morphological descriptors and represents the first large-scale assessment (900 trees) of jackfruit diversity in multiple locations (nine villages). Among the descriptors studied, those most closely associated with jackfruit marketability showed a trend for selection among the trees located in homesteads. Both fruits and leaves were larger in plants on homesteads compared to plants in forest/fallow lands, and fruit quality was significantly higher in homestead trees compared to the other two location categories. However, 18.7% and 23.7% of the fruits found on public lands and forest/fallow lands, respectively, were still considered to be of excellent fruit quality and tree vigor was significantly higher in jackfruit in forest/fallow lands compared to the other location categories. The combination of high tree vigor and presence of excellent fruit quality among jackfruit in forest/fallow lands suggests that the \xe2\x80\x9cwild\xe2\x80\x9d Bangladeshi jackfruit germplasm, which is considered inferior for market and is being negatively impacted, has valuable genetic diversity to contribute to jackfruit cultivation. Furthermore, sampling across a gradient of habitats may enable the detection of possible trends resulting from domestication pressures.'

Abstract: 'Dendrocalamus hamiltonii is a commercially important bamboo species of India, experiencing population depletion due to heavy extraction from natural forests. Nuclear simple sequence repeats (nSSRs) were used to study the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 19 natural stands of D. hamiltonii distributed across the northeast Himalayas. A total of 68 nSSR primer pairs of D. latiflorus and Bambusa arundinacea have been tested in D. hamiltonii for their transferability, out of which 17 primers showing positive and polymorphic amplification were used for genotyping. A total of 130 alleles were generated in 535 individuals of all the populations using selected primer pairs. The marker analysis indicated that D. hamiltonii populations have maintained a low level of genetic diversity (h\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.175, I\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.291) in northeastern region of India. Despite a large proportion of the genetic variation (83.47%) confined within the populations, a moderate level of genetic differentiation (FST\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.165) was observed among the populations. The clustering pattern obtained in UPGMA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed that most of the populations were clustered in accordance with their geographical distribution. Two populations (DH03 and DH13) exhibiting significant genetic admixture were identified and recommended for in situ conservation. In addition, six highly diverse populations were also suggested for conservation in different geographical area under study. The study has revealed useful nSSR markers for D. hamiltonii, which were lacking earlier and the information generated herein is of paramount importance in devising programs for species conservation and genetic improvement.'

Abstract: 'Soil erosion is one of the serious issues threatening the environment. This degrading phenomenon deteriorates the soil fertility and drastically affects the agricultural practices. As a consequence, the productivity of soil is affected unquestionably. In this regard, there is a need to take up conservation and management measures which can be applied to check further soil erosion. Even though, soil erosion is a mass process spread across the watershed, it is not economically viable to implement conservation techniques to the entire watershed. However, a method is a pre-requisite to identify the most vulnerable areas and quantify the soil erosion. In this context, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has been adopted to estimate soil erosion in the semi-arid Andipatti Watershed of Tamil Nadu, India. This model takes into consideration the parameters including runoff-rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodability Factor (K), topographic factor (LS), cropping management factor (C), and support practice factor (P). All these layers are prepared in a geographical information system (GIS) platform using various data sources and data preparation methods. The results of the study indicate that the annual average soil loss within the watershed is about 6\xc2\xa0t/ha/yr (metric ton per hectare per year). Higher soil erosion is observed in the landuse classes of gullied wasteland, open scrub forest and degraded plantation. The soil erosion risk is extremely higher on the steep slopes and adjoining foot hills. Based on the average soil erosion values of different landuse classes and characteristics of land, a proposed landuse map was prepared. The estimated soil erosion and the proposed landuse map could be an effective input for drawing sustainable watershed development measures.'

Abstract: ' Shade coffee agroforestry systems have the potential to support biodiversity. Sustainable certification of coffee has been promoted as a means to provide incentives to maintain these systems, but as yet there is little evidence if this is effective. We analyzed tree diversity on smallholder organic and conventional farms in buffer zones of three conservation areas in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua (the later included some large-scale conventional and Rainforest Alliance certified farms). Organic farms had greater farm level tree species richness and Shannon diversity compared to conventional farms; estimated native tree species richness across the landscape was probably greater on organic farms than conventional in Nicaragua (48 vs. 28 species respectively) and possibly in Guatemala (23 vs. 15 species respectively). Organic farms had higher shade levels and more tree strata than conventional farms. In Guatemala and Nicaragua tree species composition was not closely related to whether farms were organic or conventional, although within composition clusters, organic farms tended to have greater diversity. In contrast, organic and conventional farms in Costa Rica mostly belonged to different tree species clusters. In Nicaragua most large-scale farms, and all Rainforest certified farms, formed a distinct species composition cluster with presence of old-growth forest species and within which Rainforest farms had greater diversity. Tree species composition of the shade seems to be mainly due to management history; but certification effectively differentiates those farms with greater tree diversity. Longer-term monitoring is required to determine whether certification can be an incentive to conserve or expand biodiverse coffee agroforestry systems within the buffer zones around conservation areas.'

Abstract: 'Changes in species composition and density of trees >10 cm gbh in a tropical dry evergreen forest in Puthupet, south India are interpreted for the period between 1992 and 2002. A 1-ha plot was inventoried in 1992 and was recensused in 2002. During the 10-year interval tree taxa diversity as well as stand density increased, but the basal area value decreased. Tree species richness increased by 21% (from 24 to 29 species) by an addition of eight species and local extinction of three species. The tree density increased just by eight individuals (from 1330 stems ha\xe2\x88\x921 in 1992 to 1338 ha\xe2\x88\x921 in 2002), but the basal area decreased by 8% (from 37.5 to 34.5 m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921). Many species (11 numbers) have increased in abundance rather than decreased. Many surviving species seem to have considerable stability in abundance at the local scale. The density of smaller stems (10 29 cm gbh) increased by 15.3%, while that of the larger trees decreased drastically (81.6%). Ninety percent of the missing stems were from the middlestorey of the forest. Tree density changes among the three ecological guilds revealed a decrease in stem density and an increase in basal area in the lowerstorey; while the middlestorey exhibited a reverse trend. Family-wise, tree density changes revealed that the majority of families (67%) showed an increase in stem density. Long-term studies on tree population changes are essential to estimate tree mortality and recruitment rates, which will provide a greater insight in tropical forest dynamics.'

Abstract: 'Given the heavy reliance placed on and investment in protected areas for biological conservation, there has been much debate as to how effective these are in representing biodiversity features within their boundaries. The majority of studies addressing this issue have been conducted on a regional or national basis, precluding a broad picture of patterns of representation at the species level. We present a global assessment of the representation of the terrestrial geographic ranges of complete taxonomic groups: all known extant amphibians, birds and mammals (20,736 species) within the current global system of protected areas. We conclude that it is necessary substantially to improve the levels of coverage of the geographic ranges of the majority of species, even the widespread ones. This is particularly true for rare species, which might be assumed to be foci for protected area systems. To improve on the low levels of coverage of vertebrate ranges attained by the existing areas, key regions should be targeted, but heavy reliance will also have to be placed on approaches to sustaining populations in the wider, unprotected landscape.'

Abstract: 'Indian village ecosystems are diverse with respect to population pressures, agricultural activities and production, livestock composition, energy sources, economics and infrastructural capabilities. Natural resource degradation is a major global concern and the factors and processes leading to degradation are regional and scale up from the micro levels such as village ecosystems. There is need for integrated multidisciplinary approaches for monitoring the resource status and environmental issues at the decentralized level. This paper presents an approach to assess village ecosystems using a set of key indicators developed and tested across fourteen diverse village ecosystems of the Southern India. The concept of ecosystem services associated with village ecosystems of India has been described and adopted to identify indicators and assess issues and trends. Comparison across villages has been demonstrated and the indicators successfully reflected the key environmental issues at each village level as well as differences across villages. We also report unique cases of stabilized land use and \xe2\x80\x98desakota-like\xe2\x80\x99 trends from village ecosystem studied.'

Abstract: 'Water quality survey was undertaken to study the current status of water quality of some lentic habitats of Dharwad, Haveri and Uttar Kannada districts, to provide a baseline data, comprising study of their main physical and chemical characteristics and also to evaluate the recent limnological changes those have occurred over a time period in some lentic habitats. Trophic status was also analysed. Present study reveals that Unkal lake, and B.K. Shigigatti tank of Dharwad district, Timmapur, Hosalli, and Krishnapur tanks of Haveri district are fast progressing towards hypereutrophication. Of the other tanks, Galgi tank of Dharwad district, Gudgur, Hanamapur, Medleri, and Kadkol tanks of Haveri district have reached the eutrophic stage. The anthropogenic activities, sewage and fertilizers used in agricultural fields appear to be the major causes of the eutrophication in these tanks. If the habitats have to be preserved for their intended use, sustainable and holistic management measures for the remediation of the tanks are an immediate necessity.'

Abstract: 'Influence of structural and lithological controls of various drainage patterns and their stream orientations (for 2nd, 3rd and 4th order steams) were identified to evaluate the direction and controlling factors of drainage network. To investigate the prospect of groundwater, hydrogeomorphological features of river basin viz. Mulki-Pavanje were identified and mapped. To evaluate the characteristics of the basin, different morphometric parameters (linear, areal and relief) were computed in sub-basin wise (SB-I to -VII). The linear parameters suggest drainage network is controlled by geomorphology. The form factor (F f), elongation ratio (R e) and circularity ratio (R c) suggest that the basin is in an elongated shape. The drainage density (D d) indicates resistant/permeable strata under medium-dense vegetation with moderate relief. The areal parameters of the sub-basins (except SBI and III) indicates moderate ground-slopes associated with moderately permeable rocks, which promote moderate run-off and infiltration. Drainage texture (T) of the whole basin indicates coarse texture while the SB-I, and III showing an intermediate texture. The relief parameters namely ruggedness number (R  n ) infers low basin relief and poor drainage density. To identify the most deficit/surplus zones of groundwater suitable weightages were assigned to the hydrogeomorphological units and morphometric parameters. The study reveal that the basin manifest that SB-III shall be most deficit zone of groundwater, whereas SB-VII, VI and V are found to show increase in groundwater potentiality. Groundwater prospect area in this basin is estimated to be 7% area under poor, 44% area under moderate and 49% area under good to excellent. This paper demonstrated the potential application of geographical information system (GIS) techniques to evaluate the groundwater prospect in absence of traditional groundwater monitoring data.'

Abstract: 'Adinandra belukar is a species-poor forest dominated by Adinandra dumosa (Theaceae) found in Singapore and southern Peninsular Malaysia. It is the product of secondary succession after exhaustive agricultural exploitation on land cleared of primary lowland rain forest. A high degree of similarity in vegetation between different sites was found for seven 225 m2 plots in a dinandra belukar in Singapore. Adinandra dumosa was dominant or codominant in all plots, generally found in association with the woody species Dillenia suffruticosa, Fagraea fragrans, and Rhodamnia cinerea, the climber Gynochthodes sublanceolata, the fern Dicranopteris linearis and the terrestrial orchid Bromheadia finlaysoniana. All sites had extremely acidic (pH 3.3\xe2\x80\x933.9) surface (0\xe2\x80\x9320 cm) mineral soils with very low total nitrogen (0.06\xe2\x80\x930.14%) and total phosphorus (11\xe2\x80\x9329 \xce\xbcg g-1) contents and very high carbon/nitrogen ratios (33\xe2\x80\x9348). Adinandra belukar is interpreted as a heath forest because of its floristic and physiognomic similarities with this forest formation.'

Title: 'High frequency in vitro propagation of Trichopus zeylanicus subsp. travancoricus using branch\xe2\x80\x93petiole explants'

Abstract: 'Trichopus zeylanicus subsp. travancoricus (known as Arogyapacha), an endangered ethnomedicinal plant of the Western Ghats of South India, serves as the major source of the commercial drug Jeevani. The present study established a long-term high frequency in vitro propagation protocol for Arogyapacha. Callus obtained from the branch\xe2\x80\x93petiole explants cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 4.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid upon subculture to medium with different concentrations of 6-benzyladenine (BA) either alone or in combination with an auxin favoured shoot morphogenesis. Medium with 13.3\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA alone facilitated high frequency shoot bud (mean of 93.2) formation. Medium with lower concentrations of BA (4.4, 6.6 and 8.8\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) alone or in combination with lower concentration of \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) favoured better shoot growth than 13.3\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA containing medium, but with reduced number of shoot buds. Subsequent cultures on medium with lower concentrations of BA and also on MS basal media facilitated shoot formation as well as growth of shoots. The shoot regeneration potential showed no decline up to 5\xc2\xa0years. Culture of the in vitro-derived whole branch\xe2\x80\x93leaf explants on MS basal medium developed shoots directly from the node. On medium with 19.6\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM IBA, the whole branch\xe2\x80\x93leaf explants induced nodular callus from the node, which developed shoots later. Subsequent cultures on medium with BA exhibited high frequency shoot formation. The transfer of shoots after 10\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0days culture on half-strength MS medium containing 2.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM NAA to half-strength basal medium induced a mean of 11.3 roots. Field survival of plantlets relied on the soil mix: a 1:4 ratio of sand and red-soil exhibited the highest plantlets survival (86.6%). RAPD profile of the source plant and plants regenerated from calli after 4\xc2\xa0years showed no polymorphism. The established plantlets with morpho-floral features similar to that of the source plants flowered normally and set fruits.'

Abstract: 'The present study investigates the groundwater recharge potential zone and suitable sites for artificial recharge structures in the River Vaigai upper basin, Theni district, Tamil Nadu, using GIS-based multi-parameter weighted overlay method. The study area experiences severe groundwater scarcity despite having high rainfall and runoff. Therefore, an integrated remote sensing and GIS technique is used to assess the permeability and infiltration characteristics of the area and demarcate the recharge potential zones. The recharge potential zones and site-specific artificial recharge structures have been demarcated based on the weights of multiple parameters based on their permeability and infiltration capacity to groundwater recharge. The groundwater recharge potential map shows the twenty suitable sites for artificial recharge structures such as percolation ponds, loose rock check dams, and water absorption trench (WAT) in various parts of the study area. The effective recharge practices such as percolation ponds and check dams are highly suitable for gentle-sloped barren and agricultural plains in the northwestern and northeastern parts. Whereas, the barren valley fill, bajada and streams intersecting lineaments along the middle-eastern and central part are suitable for constructing WAT and check dams. These water-harvesting features can improve the groundwater scenario of the study area and groundwater augmentation is possible in future with the help of advanced techniques like remote sensing and GIS.'

Abstract: "I believe that the KSSP's claim that all technological issues should be evaluated and assessed only in the context of their impact on the people are borne out by the case studies. Apart from the Silent Valley and the Mothi Chemicals controversies, the KSSP had a positive role to play in other technological and environmental controversies, such as those over river pollution from untreated chemical effluent being dumped in several rivers of the State by chemical and paper companies, nuclear power plant siting, and drug policy. The KSSP's position paper on industries indicates that Kerala has a high concentration of chemical industries, and urges the government to issue no more new licenses for chemical companies. Instead they urge the government to bring in more engineering and electonics industries into the State. The State government has been generally responsive to such calls by actively promoting electronics industry in the State. K.K. Subramanian and K.J. Joseph demonstrate how a \xe2\x80\x9ccapital-deficient\xe2\x80\x9d State like Kerala can stimulate economic growth and employment opportunities in the electronics sector by taking advantage of the considerably well-educated \xe2\x80\x9chuman resources\xe2\x80\x9d of the State. 1"

Abstract: 'When a natural group of plants has over many years been comprehensively and intensively studied, a large body of data, analysis and evaluation has accumulated. It is in the nature of such work on the taxonomy of such a group that this information is to be found scattered in various publications, such as research papers, checklists, monographs, Floras and other compilations. As time and research progress, some of this information will become outdated and superseded by new publications, but other information remains current and valuable. To give a review of this can provide us not only with a guide to this resource, but also with an introduction to the group in question. It may stimulate new research, as inevitably we will find that all has not been said and done, even about a group so well studied as the conifers. I hope that this paper will meet these aims.'

Abstract: 'Observed summer (May\xe2\x80\x93October) rainfall in Myanmar for the period 1981\xe2\x80\x932010 was used to investigate the interannual variability of summer monsoon rainfall over Myanmar. Empirical orthogonal function, the sequential Mann-Kendall test, power spectrum analysis, and singular value decomposition (SVD) were deployed in the study. Results from spectral analysis showed that the variability of rainfall over Myanmar exhibits a 2- to 6-year cycle. An abrupt change in rainfall over the country was noted in 1992. There was a notable increasing rainfall trend from 1989. After the sudden change, the mean rainfall increased by 36.1\xc2\xa0mm, compared with the mean rainfall before the sudden change, and was associated with a rise in temperature of about 0.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. An increase in heavy rainfall days was observed from the early 1990s to 2010. IOD and ENSO play an important role in the interannual variability of the summer rainfall over Myanmar. The covariability between rainfall over Myanmar and Indian Ocean SST generally suggests that a positive IOD mode is associated with suppressed rainfall in the central and northern parts of Myanmar. During a negative IOD mode, nearly the whole Myanmar experiences enhanced rainfall, which is associated with devastating socioeconomic impacts. The covariability between the rainfall over Myanmar and the sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean in the first and second SVD modes was dominated by warming in the east and central Pacific\xe2\x80\x94an El Ni\xc3\xb1o-like pattern\xe2\x80\x94resulting in dry conditions in central Myanmar.'

Abstract: 'We studied the regeneration of tree species in the sub-tropical forest of Alaknanda Valley in Garhwal Himalaya, India. The overall regeneration status was fairly good in the study area. Seedling density ranged between 520 and 1,240 seedlings per ha while the density of saplings varied between 400 and 800 saplings per ha. Out of eight sites studied, five sites, viz., A1, A2, B1, B2 and C2 contained the highest number of seedlings (280\xe2\x80\x93480 per ha) and saplings (200\xe2\x80\x93440 per ha) for Pinus roxburghii and remaining three sites viz., C1, D1 and D2 represented the highest number of seedlings (240\xe2\x80\x93400 per ha) and saplings (200\xe2\x80\x93240 per ha) for Anogeissus latifolius. The DBH class distribution of the tree species revealed that the highest number of individuals was concentrated in the lower diameter classes while smallest numbers were found in the higher diameter classes. Species such as Acacia catechu, Anogeissus latifolius, Dalbergia sissoo, Engelhardtia spicata, Lannea coromandelica, Mallotus philippensis and Pinus roxburghii have the largest number of saplings and seedlings in the lower DBH classes, suggesting that they have good regeneration potential. Other species such as Aegle marmelos, Bauhinia variegata, Bombax ceiba, Cassia fistula, Erythrina variegata, Haldinia cordifolia, Mangifera indica, Ougeinia oojeinensis, Phyllanthus emblica, Syzygium cumini, Terminalia alata and Toon a hexandra have either no or very small number of saplings in the lower DBH classes, which indicates that the status of these species implies poor regeneration.'

Abstract: 'Despite a global trend toward settlement, the incidence of pastoral nomadism is on the rise in the Marwar region of Rajasthan, India. Typical explanations for this change use models of population pressure; increasing herds and decreasing pasture are held to blame. This explanation, however intuitive, is unsatisfactory. Instead, changing institutional and economic patterns are creating new contexts for strategic movement. Bottlenecks in the yearly resource calendar, caused by the disintegration of obligatory social relationships, force migrations during periods of scarcity. Changes in the volume and pattern of the meat and wool markets have also created opportunities for migrating pastoralists. Producers increase their access to markets and the reproductive rate of their herd through long, annual, migration. While nomadism is a general adaptation to changes in the socioeconomic conditions of the region, differential resource endowments account for the range of strategies; wealthy herders have opportunities not enjoyed by more marginal producers.'

Abstract: 'NORMAN MYERS: An honorary visiting fellow at Green College. He is an independent scientist and consultant working in environment and development.Like most other environmental and economic sectors, forestry worldwide looks set to encounter a growing number of surprises in the sense of major divergencies from established trends. These surprises will be largely environmental or economic or both at once. Unless we do a better job of identifying them ahead of time, these surprises will often be of a scale to overwhelm our anticipatory and preventive capacities. Indeed and as this paper demonstrates, the most likely as well as the most taxing forestry problems of the future will often be the ones we have scarcely thought of. Fortunately, the same applies to forestry opportunities. In these circumstances, there is a premium on not only supplying answers to recognized questions but on raising entirely new questions.'

Abstract: 'The present study highlights the application of satellite remote sensing in the assessment and monitoring of the mangrove forests along the coastline in Goa state of India. Based on onscreen visual interpretation techniques various land use and land cover classes have been mapped and classified. An attempt has been made to analyse changes in the mangrove forest cover from 1994 to 2001 using IRS-1B LISS-II and IRS-1D LISS-III data. An increase in the mangrove vegetation in the important estuaries has been found during 1994 and 2001. During this period, the mangrove forest increased by 44.90 per cent as a result of increased protection and consequent regeneration. Plantation of mangrove species has been raised in 876 ha (1985 to 1997) by the State Forest Department\xc2\xa8'

Abstract: 'A key step towards the restoration of heavily disturbed fragile coastal wetland ecosystems is determining the composition and characteristics of the plant communities involved. This study determined and characterized the community of higher plants in the Chenier wetland of Bohai Bay using a combination of field surveys, quadrat approaches, and multivariate statistical analyses. This community was then compared to other adjacent wetlands (Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Laizhouwan, Jiaozhouwan, and Yellow River Delta wetland) located near the Huanghai and Bohai Seas using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Results showed a total of 56 higher plant species belonging to 52 genera from 20 families in Chenier wetland, the majority of which were dicotyledons. Single-species families were predominant, while larger families, including Gramineae, Compositae, Leguminosae, and Chenopodiaceae contained a higher number of species (each\xe2\xa9\xbe6 species). Cosmopolitan species were also dominant with apparent intrazonality. Abundance (number of species) of temperate species was twice that of tropical taxa. Species number of perennial herbs, such as Gramineae and Compositae, was generally higher. Plant diversity in the Chenier wetland, based on the Shannon-Wiener index, was observed to be between the Qinhuangdao and Laizhouwan indices, while no significant difference was found in other wetlands using the Simpson index. Despite these slight differences in diversity, PCoA based on species abundance and composition of the wetland flora suggest that the Bohai Chenier community was highly similar to the coastal wetlands in Tianjin and Laizhouwan, further suggesting that these two wetlands could be important breeding grounds and resources for the restoration of the plant ecosystem in the Chenier wetland.'

Abstract: ' Saraca asoca (Roxb.) Willd, commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9cAsoka\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAshoka,\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the most important medicinal plants used in raw herbal trade in India. The bark extracts of the tree are used in the treatment of leucorrhea and other uterine disorders besides also having anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-pyretic, anti-helminthic, and analgesic activity. The indiscriminate and rampant extraction of the wood to meet the ever-increasing market demand has led to a sharp decline in naturally occurring populations of the species in the country. Consequently, the species has recently been classified as \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerable\xe2\x80\x9d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Increasing deforestation and increasing demand for this medicinal plant have resulted in a limited supply and suspected widespread adulteration of the species in the raw herbal trade market. Adulteration is a serious concern due to: (i) reduction in the efficacy of this traditional medicine, (ii) considerable health risk to consumers, and (iii) fraudulent product substitution that impacts the economy for the Natural Health Product (NHP) Industry and consumers. In this paper, we provide the first attempt to assess the extent of adulteration in the raw herbal trade of S. asoca using DNA barcoding validated by NMR spectroscopic techniques. Analyzing market samples drawn from 25 shops, mostly from peninsular India, we show that more than 80\xc2\xa0% of the samples were spurious, representing plant material from at least 7 different families. This is the first comprehensive and large-scale study to demonstrate the widespread adulteration of market samples of S. asoca in India. These results pose grave implications for the use of raw herbal drugs, such as that of S. asoca, on consumer health and safety. Based on these findings, we argue for a strong and robust regulatory framework to be put in place, which would ensure the quality of raw herbal trade products and reassure consumer confidence in indigenous medicinal systems.'

Abstract: 'Soil erosion and water conservation are major concerns arising from agricultural acceleration, changing land patterns and uncertain rainfall pattern. Soil erosion within watersheds results in increasing the deposition of sedimentation in the water bodies and thus dropping their carrying capacity and life span. Soil erosion studies are crucial for watershed design and management. The objective of current investigation is to quantify sediment yield of Upper Karha watershed of Pune district, Maharashtra, India, which is a semi-arid zone and rain-shadow region. In the present study, the sediment yield assessment by USLE model and RUSLE model is performed with the help of remote sensing and geographical information system. The average annual sediment yield is observed, i.e. 4.54\xc2\xa0tonne/acre/year and 4.14\xc2\xa0tonne/acre/year by USLE and RUSLE models, respectively. To address the current issue of sedimentation, suitable sites and suitable types of structures were suggested for soil and water conservation.'

Abstract: 'This study was carried out to simulate the forest cover changes in India using Land Change Modeler. Classified multi-temporal long-term forest cover data was used to generate the forest covers of 1880 and 2025. The spatial data were overlaid with variables such as the proximity to roads, settlements, water bodies, elevation and slope to determine the relationship between forest cover change and explanatory variables. The predicted forest cover in 1880 indicates an area of 10,42,008 km2, which represents 31.7% of the geographical area of India. About 40% of the forest cover in India was lost during the time interval of 1880\xe2\x80\x932013. Ownership of majority of forest lands by non-governmental agencies and large scale shifting cultivation are responsible for higher deforestation rates in the Northeastern states. The six states of the Northeast (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura) and one union territory (Andaman & Nicobar Islands) had shown an annual gross rate of deforestation of >0.3 from 2005 to 2013 and has been considered in the present study for the prediction of future forest cover in 2025. The modelling results predicted widespread deforestation in Northeast India and in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and hence is likely to affect the remaining forests significantly before 2025. The multi-layer perceptron neural network has predicted the forest cover for the period of 1880 and 2025 with a Kappa statistic of >0.70. The model predicted a further decrease of 2305 km2 of forest area in the Northeast and Andaman & Nicobar Islands by 2025. The majority of the protected areas are successful in the protection of the forest cover in the Northeast due to management practices, with the exception of Manas, Sonai-Rupai, Nameri and Marat Longri. The predicted forest cover scenario for the year 2025 would provide useful inputs for effective resource management and help in biodiversity conservation and for mitigating climate change.'

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02907331
Abstract: 'Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) depends upon harvesting a small fraction of the total productivity. Over-exploitation can lead to a loss of biodiversity, but a low level of extraction, without value addition at the point of origin, is usually not economically feasible for extractors. Extraction and productivity levels per unit area for most non-timber forest products are unknown, nor do we have much information about value addition at various points in the marketing channels. Here we determine extraction and productivity levels for Amla trees (Phyllanthus emblica), which yield fruits that are used for a wide variety of purposes in preparation of various foods, beverages and medicines. We also present preliminary data on the price appreciation of the fruit for one of the processed products. We have determined that the current level of extraction, 60-80% of all fruits at the population level, may have a negative effect on new recruitment. We present a model for value addition that has the potential to enhance income and reduce the level of extraction. This model is currently being implemented by the Soliga community with the assistance of a non-governmental organization.'

Abstract: 'Wild relatives of cultivated plants are the treasure trove of genetic resources for crop improvement and dietary diversification. Especially, they are crucial for conferring diseases resistance and abiotic stress tolerance (such as drought, flood, heat-shock, salinity, etc.) in cultivated crops and thereby breeding next generation of climate smart crops (i.e. climate resilient crops) for futuristic climatic conditions. Unfortunately, most of the wild relatives of crop plants across the world are being neglected and underutilized, without recognizing its real potential. In this backdrop, the book herein review titled \xe2\x80\x9cWild Relatives of Cultivated Plants in India: A Reservoir of Alternative Genetic Resources and More\xe2\x80\x9d, authored by Anurudh Kumar Singh, National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi, India is a timely and topical endeavor to provide a vivid account of more than 958 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants in India along with their occurrence, distribution, current status, as well as their future potential for breeding program and dietary diversification. Moreover, the author has also explored the additional utility of such crop species for ecosystem restoration, phytoremediation and soil carbon sequestration in detail. Here we distill the essence of this 309-page book for the better comprehension and understanding for a wide range of potential readers like graduate students and doctoral researchers in agricultural and environmental sciences, agronomist, plant breeders, as well as various national and international policy makers and regulatory agencies.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity is a key to human well-being. However universally acknowledged, this reality is not appreciated as much as one might imagine or hope. Having achieved a high standing in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992, biodiversity appears to have gradually fallen from that position in the 20 years since. This is evidenced by the fact that most discussions and actions in relation to the CBD have now shifted to sustainable development and ecosystem services (Daily 1997), instead of focusing more directly on biodiversity values themselves. One reason for this fall in status seems to be linked to issues about the actual definition of \xe2\x80\x98biodiversity\xe2\x80\x99, whether used in a broad sense, including the diversity of genes, species, communities and ecosystems, or more narrowly defined as the diversity of species alone. While the close link between biodiversity and \xe2\x80\x98ecosystem services\xe2\x80\x99 is undeniable, biodiversity itself has long recognized links to human well-being, including...'

Abstract: 'The precautionary principle is one of the most contentious principles in contemporary international legal developments. The very fact that it is a principle of international environmental law has been questioned by many legal scholars. However, this does not take away the fact that the precautionary principle continues to be applied widely across sectors both internationally and nationally. The nature and scope of its application has varied widely according to the context and sector within which it has been applied. The central issue which this article seeks to address is the regulatory and the policy making space that is available to the Government of India in the context of the obligations as undertaken under the Cartagena Protocol and under various other international treaties. The regulatory space would also be affected by the domestic legal developments across sectors in which the principle has been applied. India\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision on the large-scale commercialisation of Bt-Cotton has already created much debate regarding its appropriateness given the realities of Indian farm practices. More specifically, it has also led to a rethinking of the role and application of the precautionary principle in addressing these realities. Considering that the Indian policy on biotechnology is currently being drafted, it is important to look into the scope of applying the precautionary principle in taking any decision on genetically modified organisms (GMO) in terms of their distribution of risks, incorporating the social and equity impacts of such decisions.'

Abstract: 'Cryptic species are difficult to identify using morphological identification tools. They represent hitherto unknown biodiversity and their discovery helps formulate more efficient conservation management policies. In this study we assess intraspecific diversity of Rhinolophus rouxii and investigate the presence of cryptic lineages. We characterize acoustic, morphological and genetic differences between allopatric populations of this species in Southern India. Our results reveal the presence of two distinct acoustic lineages (80 and 90\xc2\xa0kHz phonic types). Forearm length also differs significantly between the two phonic types. They share a sister taxa relationship and the average genetic distance between them is over 8 %. Phylogenetic reconstruction and the associated divergence time suggest an evolutionary history that correlates with a middle Miocene separation. We propose that these two phonic types be called sibling species and evolutionarily significant units (ESU) within the subgenus Indorhinolophus. We recommend a new name, R. indorouxii for the species representing the 90\xc2\xa0kHz phonic type. This study reiterates our lack of accurate taxonomic knowledge of bats, and highlights the value in combining genetics with behavioral (phonic characterization) and morphological measurements in the discovery of cryptic species.'

Abstract: 'Microfinance projects now seek to achieve improvement in environmental quality in addition to poverty alleviation. Achievement of these goals may depend upon the economic and environmental impact of microfinance businesses. This study is a quantitative analysis of these outcomes for Ecodevelopment, an Indian microfinance project, which aims to prevent forest degradation by poverty alleviation. The study divides businesses into perishable goods, non-perishable goods, simple skills, and special skills and measures their economic outcome by two indicators, repayment percentage and continuity of businesses. The study examines the effect of loan amount on the economic outcome of businesses. To quantify the environmental outcome, it analyzes the use of firewood or fodder and release of pollutants by businesses. The results show that loan amount does not affect the economic outcome, special skills have best performance, and skills cause less pressure on forest resources. These results suggest the need for development of knowledge-intensive skills, involvement of institutions in the operations of business, and inclusive policies for protected area management.'

Abstract: 'Shoreline changes on account of global climate change and sea level rise is one of the major problems along the coastlines in different continents of the world. This study was carried out along the coastlines of Andhra Pradesh state in India using multi-temporal satellite images from 1973 to 2015 period. Long-term coastal erosion and accretion rate over a period of 42\xc2\xa0years has calculated using Digital Shoreline Analysis System and prepared shoreline maps by using GIS-Software. End point rate (EPR) statistical method is applied to estimate the shoreline change rate. Various coastal parameters like sea level rise, geomorphology, elevation and coastal slope were used to find out the interactive relationship between the physical parameters and shoreline changes in the area. The study revealed that the coastal changes are more dominant in Krishna and Godavari Deltaic plain. The average erosion and accretion rate observed in the Krishna Godavari delta was 10.63 and 17.29\xc2\xa0m per year respectively. The study indicated that, climatic changes and fluvial process are playing key role in changing shoreline positions. The study exhibited that elevation and slope are played intense role in the shoreline positional change. The present study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and EPR statistical method as an accurate and reliable method for shoreline change analysis.'

Abstract: 'The present study deals with the species abundance, diversity and species richness of avian communities in the Bangalore University Campus (BUC), Bengaluru, India. One hundred and six species of birds belonging to 42 families under 68 genera were recorded. Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener\xe2\x80\x99s and Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s alpha diversities, species evenness, species richness of bird communities, number of bird species and percentage of population density of birds between various seasons in the BUC differed significantly between the study years. Of these bird species, the relative abundance (6.96\xc2\xa0%) and species distribution ratio (0.070) of Psittacula krameri were highest, whereas relative abundance (0.04\xc2\xa0%) and species distribution ratio (0.002) of Coracias benghalensis were lowest. The existing 32 species of flowering plants/trees belonging to 29 genera under 14 families in the campus are used for perching by birds. Moreover 29 species of flowering plants/trees belonging to 24 genera under 16 families depend on birds for pollination and/or seed dispersal. Occurrence of greater bird diversity and abundance of avian communities were recorded highest in the winter season in the BUC premises. In the different seasons, the BUC had varying community structure of birds between the study years. BUC suffers from numerous threats namely grass cutting, fire and grazing of domestic animals. Conservation methods needed for habitat management are restoration of vegetation and wetlands, and increase plant and tree diversity to protect the ecosystem of BUC habitat and to preserve its diversity of avifauna.'

Abstract: 'Analysis of information from about 287 sample plots on Northeast China Transect (NECT) indicated that between 1986 and 1994 at latitude 43.48\xc2\xb0 N to 43.55\xc2\xb0 N and longitude 124.93\xc2\xb0 E to 131.28\xc2\xb0 E, the relative abundance of different tree species changed differently. The change of relative abundance for the moisture-sensitive tree species, such as Quercus mongolica and Larix olgensis, was helpful to detect climate change. Use of GIS software and the \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2w indices of tree diversity on NECT showed that the areas of high and medium tree diversity decreased, respectively, while the area of low tree diversity increased. The heterogeneity of habitats along the NECT increased with climate change and local human activities.'

Abstract: "One of the last primitive island ecosystems in the Indian Ocean has been invaded since 1969 by the Sri Lankan privet, Ligustrum robustum. L. robustum is still spreading in the forests of La R\xc3\xa9union Island, where only 30% of the original vegetation remains, but where 98% of the primary native vegetation of the Mascarene Islands still exists. On Mauritius, where L. robustum was introduced about 1895, it now forms dense, impenetrable thickets, and its presence has been correlated with the inability of native vegetation to re-establish. We assessed the potential impacts of L. robustum invasion on the native ecosystems of La R\xc3\xa9union and identified the factors of invasibility. We determined the degree of invasion in 12 plots of 156 m2 and followed native flora and privet recruitment for 3 years in 12 seedling plots of 39 m2. The data show that monocultural L. robustum stands now exist in human-disturbed primary forest patches (3.3 individuals/m2 and 80% of total individuals) and high seedling densities (0.3\xe2\x80\x930.6/m2) occur in the least disturbed patches. L. robustum's rapid growth, high shade tolerance and seed production, bird-assisted seed dispersal and high seedling recruitment contribute to its invasiveness in intact forests. The conservation of the original ecosystems of La R\xc3\xa9union depends on the setting up of a long-term and immediate global control strategy."

Abstract: 'This article presents the results of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for Bangalore, South India. Analyses have been carried out considering the seismotectonic parameters of the region covering a radius of 350\xc2\xa0km keeping Bangalore as the center. Seismic hazard parameter \xe2\x80\x98b\xe2\x80\x99 has been evaluated considering the available earthquake data using (1) Gutenberg\xe2\x80\x93Richter (G\xe2\x80\x93R) relationship and (2) Kijko and Sellevoll (1989, 1992) method utilizing extreme and complete catalogs. The \xe2\x80\x98b\xe2\x80\x99 parameter was estimated to be 0.62 to 0.98 from G\xe2\x80\x93R relation and 0.87\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.03 from Kijko and Sellevoll method. The results obtained are a little higher than the \xe2\x80\x98b\xe2\x80\x99 values published earlier for southern India. Further, probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for Bangalore region has been carried out considering six seismogenic sources. From the analysis, mean annual rate of exceedance and cumulative probability hazard curve for peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral acceleration (Sa) have been generated. The quantified hazard values in terms of the rock level peak ground acceleration (PGA) are mapped for 10% probability of exceedance in 50\xc2\xa0years on a grid size of 0.5\xc2\xa0km\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa00.5\xc2\xa0km. In addition, Uniform Hazard Response Spectrum (UHRS) at rock level is also developed for the 5% damping corresponding to 10% probability of exceedance in 50\xc2\xa0years. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) value of 0.121\xc2\xa0g obtained from the present investigation is slightly lower (but comparable) than the PGA values obtained from the deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) for the same area. However, the PGA value obtained in the current investigation is higher than PGA values reported in the global seismic hazard assessment program (GSHAP) maps of Bhatia et al. (1999) for the shield area.'

Abstract: 'The area chosen for the present study is Dhule district, which belongs to the drought prone area of Maharashtra State, India. Dhule district suffers from water problem, and therefore, there is no extra water available to supply for the agricultural and industrial growth. To understand the lithological characters in terms of its hydro-geological conditions, it is necessary to understand the geology of the area. It is now established fact that the geophysical method gives a better information of subsurface geology. Geophysical electrical surveys with four electrodes configuration, i.e., Wenner and Schlumberger method, were carried out at the same selected sites to observe the similarity and compared both the applications in terms of its use and handling in the field. A total 54 VES soundings were carried out spread over the Dhule district and representing different lithological units. The VES curves are drawn using inverse slope method for Wenner configuration, IPI2 win Software, and curve matching techniques were used for Schlumberger configuration. Regionwise lithologs are prepared based on the obtained resistivity and thickness for Wenner method. Regionwise curves were prepared based on resistivity layers for Schlumberger method. Comparing the two methods, it is observed that Wenner and Schlumberger methods have merits or demerits. Considering merits and demerits from the field point of view, it is suggested that Wenner inverse slope method is more handy for calculation and interpretation, but requires lateral length which is a constrain. Similarly, Schlumberger method is easy in application but unwieldy for their interpretation. The work amply proves the applicability of geophysical techniques in the water resource evaluation procedure. This technique is found to be suitable for the areas with similar geological setup elsewhere.'

Abstract: 'Our series of manuscripts on Threatened Fishes of the World came to an end after a prolonged and increasingly depressing and frustrating history. Prolonged because the series extended from 1995 to 2013, much longer than was anticipated. Increasingly depressing because it became clear to even the most skeptical reader that the status of a great many fishes is a matter of real concern. Frustrating because the accounts mostly presented the same picture for almost every species.'

Abstract: 'The present investigation describes the in vitro propagation of Plectranthus bourneae via liquid culture system from axillary bud and shoot tip explants. Multiple shoots were initiated from axillary bud and shoot tip explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations (0.1\xe2\x80\x932.0\xc2\xa0mg/l) and combinations of cytokinins [BA (6-benzyladenine), KN (kinetin), and TDZ (thidizauron)] along with (0.5\xe2\x80\x932.0\xc2\xa0mg/l) auxins [NAA (\xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid), IAA (indole-3 acetic acid), IBA (indole-3-butyric acid)]. Maximum shoot multiplication (12.14) was achieved from axillary bud explant followed by shoot tip explant (8.85) at 0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l TDZ with 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/l NAA. A maximum of 9.71 roots/shoot was observed at 0.7\xc2\xa0mg/l IBA. The rooted plantlets successfully hardened and transferred to greenhouse condition with 83% survival. Inter-simple sequence repeat markers exhibited genetic fidelity with 100% monomorphism in regenerants. The authenticated protocol supports rapid production of true-to-type plants by liquid culture in vitro and therefore could supply a valuable target material for genetic transformation study.'

Abstract: 'Present study revealed the presence of 16 earthworm species belonging to 11 genera and four families viz. Megascolecidae (Amynthus alexandri, Metaphire houlleti, Lampito mauritii, Kanchuria sp1, Perionyx excavatus), Octochaetidae (Eutyphoeus gigas, Eutyphoeus comillahnus, Eutyphoeus orientalis, Octochaetona beatrix, Dichogaster bolaui, Lennogaster chittagongensis, Lennogaster yeicus), Moniligastridae (Drawida papillifer papillifer, Drawida assamensis, Drawida nepalensis) and Glossoscolecidae (Pontoscolex corethrurus) in the soils of five bamboo species [Bambusa balcooa (Sil Barak), Melocanna baccifera (Muli), Bambusa polumorpha (Bari), Bambus cacharensis (Bom) and Bambus bambus (Katabarak)] of West-Tripura. While four earthworm species viz. Metaphire houlleti, Drawida assamensis, Drawida papillifer papillifer and Pontoscolex corethrurus were common to all species of bamboo plantations, the rest showed restricted distribution. Among the earthworm species 4 were exotic (Amynthus alexandri, Metaphire houlleti, Dichogaster bolaui and Pontoscolex corethrurus) and the others were native to the Indian sub-continent. In general, earthworms under the bamboo plantations occurred within temperature range of 21.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C\xe2\x80\x9328.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, pH 4.0\xe2\x80\x937.0, organic matter 0.56\xe2\x80\x935.99\xc2\xa0%, moisture 9.6\xe2\x80\x9331.7\xc2\xa0%, water holding capacity 14.6\xe2\x80\x9343.9\xc2\xa0% and bulk density 0.7\xe2\x80\x931.8\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x88\x923.

Earthworm diversity, dominance and evenness indices showed the values 1.00, 0.47 and 0.70 respectively. Earthworm density and biomass showed a negative correlation with temperature whereas those had a strong positive correlation with pH, moisture and organic matter of the soils.'

Abstract: 'An understanding of the rooting pattern of tree species used in agroforestry systems is essential for the development and management of systems involving them. Seasonal variation, depth wise and lateral distribution of biomass in roots of different diameter classes and their annual production were studied using sequential core sampling. The investigations were carried out in four tree species under \xe2\x80\x98tree only\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98tree+crop\xe2\x80\x99 situations at ICAR Research Farm, Barapani (Meghalya), India. The tree species were mandarin (Citrus reticulata), alder (Alnus nepalensis), cherry (Prunus cerasoides) and albizia (Paraserianthes falcataria). The contribution of fine roots to the total root biomass ranged from 87% in albizia to 77% in mandarin. The bulk of the fine roots (38% to 47%) in the four tree species was concentrated in the upper 10 cm soil layer, but the coarse roots were concentrated in 10\xe2\x80\x9320 cm soil depth in alder (46%) and albizia (51%) and at 0\xe2\x80\x9310 cm in cherry (41%) and mandarin (48%). In all the four tree species, biomass of both fine- and coarse-roots followed a unimodal growth curve by showing a gradual increase from spring (pre-rainy) season to autumn (post rainy) season. Biomass to necromass ratio varied between 2 to 3 in the four tree species. The maximum (3.2) ratio was observed during spring and the minimum (2) in the rainy season. In alder and albizia, the fine roots were distributed only up to 1 m distance from the tree trunk but in the other two species they were found at a distance up to 1.5 m from the tree trunk. The annual fine root production varied from 3.6 Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921 to 6.2 Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921 and total production from 4.2 to 8.4 Mg ha\xe2\x88\x921 in albizia to mandarin, respectively. Cherry and mandarin had a large number of woody roots in the surface layers which pose physical hindrance during soil working and intercultural operations under agroforestry. But the high biomass of roots of these two species may be advantageous for sequential or spatially separated agroforestry systems. However, alder and albizia have the most desirable rooting characteristics for agroforestry systems.'

Abstract: 'Caecilians of the genus Ichthyophis Fitzinger, 1826 are among the most poorly known amphibian taxa within Southeast Asia. Populations of Ichthyophis from the Indochina region (comprising Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam) have been assigned to five taxa: Ichthyophis acuminatus, Ichthyophis bannanicus, Ichthyophis kohtaoensis, Ichthyophis laosensis, and Ichthyophis nguyenorum. Barcoding of recently collected specimens indicates that Indochinese congeners form a clade that includes several morphologically and genetically distinct but yet undescribed species. Although body coloration is supported by the molecular analyses as a diagnostic character at species level, unstriped forms are paraphyletic with respect to striped Ichthyophis. Based on our morphological and molecular analyses, three distinct unstriped ichthyophiid species, Ichthyophis cardamomensis sp. nov. from western Cambodia, Ichthyophis catlocensis sp. nov. from southern Vietnam, and Ichthyophis chaloensis sp. nov. from central Vietnam are described as new herein, almost doubling the number of Ichthyophis species known from the Indochinese region. All three new species differ from their unstriped congeners in a combination of morphological and molecular traits. In addition, redescriptions of three unstriped Ichthyophis species (Ichthyophis acuminatus, I. laosensis, I. youngorum) from Indochina and adjacent Thailand are provided.'

Abstract: ' Efficient protocols of axillary bud multiplication and indirect organogenesis were established for Holostemma ada-kodien Schult. (Asclepiadaceae). Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x80\x931 N6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x80\x931 indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) induced an average of eight shoots per node and was the best for axillary bud proliferation. Subsequent cultures enhanced the number of shoots. The explant source of callus and the growth regulator inducing the callus exhibited significant influence on organogenesis. Callus developed from the basal cut end of the node explants differentiated more than 15 shoots on MS medium fortified with 1.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x80\x931BAP. Callus from internode explants developed fewer shoots than callus from the basal cut ends of node explants. Leaf-derived callus did not undergo organogenesis. The abscission of leaves and shoot tips of the developed shoots was prevented by the addition of AgNO3 or CoCl2, but with a concomitant significant reduction in the number of shoots. Half-strength solid MS or liquid medium with 0.05\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x80\x931 IBA exhibited the best in vitro rooting. Ninety percent of the rooted shoots survived in the field.'

Abstract: 'Although Myanmar exports millions of dollars of rattan cane each year, the last systematic treatment of rattans in this country was done over 100 years ago, and virtually nothing has been written about the collection and trade of this important forest resource. Here we report the results from a study of rattans in the Hukaung Valley Tiger Reserve in northern Myanmar. A total of 15 species of rattan were encountered; seven species are new records for Myanmar and two species are new to science. Inventory transects revealed that the density of commercial rattans in local forests averages 40.5 canes \xe2\x89\xbd4m long/hectare. Populations of all species appear to be actively regenerating. The current pattern of rattan exploitation, however, is largely uncontrolled and will eventually lead to resource depletion unless some form of management is implemented.'

Abstract: 'Despite their obvious environmental, societal and economic importance, our understanding of the causes and magnitude of the variations in the global water cycle is still unsatisfactory. Uncertainties in hydrological predictions from the current generation of models pose a serious challenge to the reliability of forecasts and projections across time and space scales. This paper provides an overview of the current issues and challenges in modelling various aspects of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s hydrological cycle. These include: the global water budget and water conservation, the role of model resolution and parametrisation of precipitation-generating processes on the representation of the global and regional hydrological cycle, representation of clouds and microphysical processes, rainfall variability, the influence of land\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere coupling on rainfall patterns and their variability, monsoon processes and teleconnections, and ocean and cryosphere modelling. We conclude that continued collaborative activity in the areas of model development across timescales, process studies and climate change studies will provide better understanding of how and why the hydrological cycle may change, and better estimation of uncertainty in model projections of changes in the global water cycle.'

Abstract: 'Monitoring forest cover change and understanding the dynamic of forest cover is increasingly important in sustainable development and management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses remote sensing (RS) techniques to monitor forest cover change in Ma\xc3\xa7kaState Forest Enterprise (MSFE) located in NE of Turkey through 1975 to 2000 and then analyses spatial and temporal changes in forest cover by Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and FRAGSTATS\xe2\x84\xa2. Forest cover changes were detected from a time series of satellite images of Landsat MSS in 1975, Landsat TM in 1987, and Landsat ETM+ in 2000 using RS and GIS. The results showed that total forest area, productive forest area and degraded forest area increased while broadleaf forest area and non forest area decreased. Mixed forest and degraded forest increased during the first (1975\xe2\x80\x931987) period, but decreased during the second (1987\xe2\x80\x932000) period. During the whole study period, the annual forestation rate was 152 ha year\xe2\x88\x921, equivalent to 0.27% year\xe2\x88\x921 using the compound-interest-rate formula. The total number of patches increased from 36,204 to 48,092 (33%), and mean size of forest patch (MPS) decreased from 2.8 ha to 2.1 ha during a 25 year period. Number of smaller patches (patches in 0\xe2\x80\x93100 ha size class) increased, indicating more fragmented landscape over time that might create a risk for the maintenance of biodiversity of the area. While total population increased from 1975 to 2000 (3.7%), rural population constantly decreased. The increase of forest areas may well be explained by the fact that demographic movement of rural areas concentrated intoMa\xc3\xa7ka City Center. These figures also indicated that decrease in the rural population might likely lead to the release of human pressure to forest areas, probably resulting in a positive development of forest areas.'

Abstract: 'The historical collections in herbaria are increasingly used for documentation of biodiversity. The use of herbarium reconstruction in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, using a case study from Srinagar city in Kashmir Himalaya has been shown. During the present investigation, a comprehensive and updated biodiversity database of 937 plant taxa has been developed, which is based on expert investigation of ca. 45,000 plant specimens deposited in the herbarium of University of Kashmir, and careful supplementation of field records in the study area made over the last one decade. The results indicate a clear dominance of herbaceous growth form as 602 species were herbs. Majority of the plant species possess perennial life span, as 610 plant species fall under this category. Inspite of being a rapidly urbanising centre, Srinagar city owing to its location in the global biodiversity hotspot of Himalayas exhibits a clear dominance of wild-growing plant species. In the database, 20 species fall under different threat categories. The present study is the documentation of plant biodiversity of this eco-fragile mountainous region and clearly demonstrates the precious value of biological collections in bridging the knowledge gaps in global biodiversity hotspots, including Himalayas. Looking ahead, the biodiversity database can serve as a baseline in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and more importantly, the database can provide the reference framework in assessing and monitoring the impending impacts of land use and climate change on the biodiversity of this Himalayan city.'

Abstract: 'We critically discuss the impact of sustainable development initiatives in Kerala, India, on biodiversity and on women farmers in the matrilineal Adivasi community of the Kurichya-tribe in Wayanad. By contextualizing development programs regarding the specifically gendered access to land, division of labor, distribution of knowledge and decision-making power, we situate our analysis within the theoretical framework of feminist political ecology. We first outline women\xe2\x80\x99s gaining of social and political space in local self-government institutions (Panchayath) and then critically discuss the impacts of women\xe2\x80\x99s farming groups (Joint Liability Groups: JLGs). Decentralization and development programs have aimed at empowering women and reducing poverty through improved food security. However, little success has materialized, as patriarchal power structures concerning decision-making processes as well as control over the most valuable resources (land and rice) and traditional knowledge have been maintained. Whereas women\xe2\x80\x99s self-help groups (Kudumbasree) in Kerala have enhanced their position, women\xe2\x80\x99s farming groups (JLGs), by contrast, have brought little betterment. In some cases they have even downsized women\xe2\x80\x99s management and knowledge of resources related to agriculture and do not integrate or enhance Kurichya women\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. As some women are now introducing high-yielding rice seeds and fertilizer and as it is impossible for them to control land and get access to traditional rice seeds\xe2\x80\x94the domain of men\xe2\x80\x94we contest the notion of women being considered the preservers of agrobiodiversity. We argue, rather, that the construction and transformation of ecological traditional knowledge is highly dependent on the gendered multi-scaled power structures of state and community.'

Abstract: ' The occurrence of high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater (>1.5\xc2\xa0mg/l) in the villages of Singhpur and Sagaragan in the Nayagarh District of Orissa and its relation with the fluoride-rich hot spring water (>10\xc2\xa0mg/l) located nearby have been studied. The composition of the hot spring water is very comparable to the other thermal waters of the world. Thermodynamic considerations show that more than 65% of the groundwater and hot spring water samples are oversaturated with calcite, and only four samples are oversaturated with fluorite. Fluoride concentration shows a positive relation to sodium, bicarbonate and pH, and a negative relation to calcium and magnesium in fluoride-rich groundwater and hot spring water. Principal component analysis shows that the fluoride-rich groundwater was produced due to a mixing of hot spring water with the surrounding groundwater. Studies of the saturation index of fluorite with log  electrical conductivity also indicate mixing of hot spring water with the surrounding groundwater. The spatial distribution of fluoride in groundwater follows the topography of the area.'

Title: 'Arrested charnockite formation in southern India and Sri Lanka'

Abstract: 'Arrested prograde charnockite formation in quartzofeldspathic gneisses is widespread in the high-grade terrains of southern India and Sri Lanka. Two major kinds of orthopyroxene-producing reactions are recognized. Breakdown of calcic amphibole by reaction with biotite and quartz in tonalitic/granitic \xe2\x80\x9cgray gneiss\xe2\x80\x9d produced the regional orthopyroxene isograd, manifest in charnockitic mottling and veining of \xe2\x80\x9cmixed-facies\xe2\x80\x9d exposures, as at Kabbal, Karnataka, and in the Kurunegala District of the Sri Lanka Central Highlands. Chemical and modal analyses of carefully chosen immediately-adjacent amphibole gneiss and charnockite pairs show that the orthopyroxene is produced by an open system reaction involving slight losses of CaO, MgO and FeO and gains of SiO2 and Na2O. Rb and Y are depleted in the charnockite. Another kind of charnockitization is found in paragneisses throughout the southern high-grade area, and involves the reaction of biotite and quartz\xc2\xb1garnet to produce orthopyroxene and K-feldspar. Although charnockite formation along shears and other deformation zones at such localities as Ponmudi, Kerala is highly reminiscent of Kabbal, close pair analyses are not as suggestive of open-system behavior. This type of charnockite formation is found in granulite facies areas where no prograde amphibole-bearing gneisses exist and connotes a higher-grade reaction than that of the orthopyroxene isograd. Metamorphic conditions of both Kabbaltype and Ponmudi-type localities were 700\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x93800\xc2\xb0 C and 5\xe2\x80\x936 kbar. Lower P(H2O) in the Ponmudi-type metamorphism was probably the definitive factor.'

Abstract: 'The general circulation model of the NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS GCM) was designed primarily for global climate change and climate sensitivity applications. The modelling group at GISS has developed new and more physically appropriate parameterizations of meteorological/hydrological processes which are being validated in an effort to improve the performance of the Model II version of the GISS GCM. This study discusses some preliminary evaluations of this testing based on multiple-year simulations at 4\xc2\xb0 latitude by 5\xc2\xb0 longitude horizontal resolution. These runs individually incorporate new formulations of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the moist cumulus convection scheme and the ground hydrology and compare results using B-grid and C-grid numerics. The new PBL produces a realistically stronger tropical surface circulation, while the new cumulus scheme generates more realistic distributions of tropical convection and moisture. The main impact of the more sophisticated ground hydrology model is to increase surface air temperatures. Improvements in modelled sea level pressure and rainfall features by the C-grid are somewhat offset by increases in speed excesses at the cores of the summer hemisphere westerly jets. Each modelling innovation targeted a different aspect of the climate not adequately represented by Model II. However, since the various modelling changes were tested individually, the present evaluation could not demonstrate many dramatic improvements in the simulated climates. This documentation of impacts should, however, serve as a benchmark for the validation of future simulations of the GISS GCM that combine all of the modelling improvements.'

Abstract: 'Within the framework of IWRM, a major concern in the humid tropics is the effects of \xe2\x80\x98global warming\xe2\x80\x99 on the storm rainfall-runoff hydrology of both forests and converted forest lands. Further how such effects need to be incorporated within adaptive, forest-water-land management. But since the mid- 20th century, dramatic changes in land- use (LU) and land cover (LC) have also occurred which have led to rapid rates of deforestation and an expansion of land\xe2\x80\x94forest degradation. How much these man-induced impacts have been influential on climate \xe2\x80\x93water relations, as against the effects of inherent climate variability and predicted climate change scenarios, still remains a major challenge to quantify. Thus embedded within the global warming issue are these additional LU/LC change impacts on climate-rainfall-storm runoff across scales which also require consideration under the broader mandate of \xe2\x80\x98global change\xe2\x80\x99. The work will initially succinctly summarize the existing uncertainties linked with both Global Climate Models (GCMs). Subsequently more detailed attention will be given to uncertainties linked with LC/LU change. The experiences of hurricane Mitch in Central America will then set the scene for an alternative strategy. A principle message is a call for more concentrated research effort on geographically the outer margins of the \xe2\x80\x98maritime continent\xe2\x80\x99 (centred on the Indonesian Archipelago) in the Western Pacific where tropical cyclone frequency is very high. This region presents a diversity of socio-economies and an opportunity to produce adapted forest-land management measures in preparation for future global change (warming and anthropogenic). Such measures can then be extrapolated to currently less frequently, affected areas from extreme events like hurricane Mitch. Examples from research in the tropical- cyclone prone, \xe2\x80\x9cWet Tropics\xe2\x80\x9d of northeast Australia linked with the management of tropical rainforests and the adjoining sugar cane lands are then used to demonstrate these opportunities.'

Abstract: 'Habitat loss and fragmentation are significant threats for primate species worldwide. However, few attempts have been made to look for general patterns in primate responses to habitat loss and fragmentation, or whether these may be associated with species\xe2\x80\x99 traits. We conducted a review of published literature on effects of patch size to quantify the effect of a reduction in this predictor on primates, and to determine whether these effects depend on species\xe2\x80\x99 traits. The effects of patch size on seven response variables (density, parasite prevalence and diversity, presence, genetic diversity, time spent feeding, resting and movement), were extracted from 135 papers and compared across six species traits (diet specialisation, social structure, body size, home range size, group size and dispersal ability). We found that density, parasitic prevalence and diversity and time spent feeding were positively associated with a reduction in patch size, while species\xe2\x80\x99 presence and genetic diversity were negatively associated. Time spent resting and moving did not show clear patterns. We found little evidence that the effect of patch size varies consistently with traits. This study provides important evidence for the consistent effect of patch size on a range of factors that influence the dynamics of primate populations. However, there is a need to move beyond quantifying patch size effects alone and to quantify the effects of changes occurring at broader landscape scales. This would allow more holistic primate conservation strategies to be developed across whole landscapes rather than being focussed on the management of individual patches.\n'

Abstract: 'Saraca asoca (Roxb.) Wilde (Caesalpiniaceae) is a medicinally important and globally vulnerable plant species found in the evergreen forests of India (Thakur et al.1989). S. asoca, commonly known as Ashoka tree, is considered as one of the sacred trees of India and is highly prized for its beautiful foliage and fragrant flowers. Almost all parts of the tree are known to have important medicinal properties including antiviral (Hattori et al.1995), oxytotic (Satyavati et al.1970), menorrhagic, anti-HIV (Kusumoto et al.1995) and antibacterial activities (Annapurna et al.1999). The flower extract is commonly used in diabetes and cancer treatments (Anonymous 1952; Mukherji et\xc2\xa0al.1970; Verghese et\xc2\xa0al.1992). Overharvesting of S. asoca due to its high medicinal value along with high deforestation rates, habitat fragmentation and illegal encroachments of its natural habitats have resulted in severe reduction in natural populations of this species (Gowda et al.2002).

Abstract: 'Assessing the preparedness of the coastal region to the anticipated sea level rise is a major task among the coastal management authority, where identification of relative vulnerable of coast is a prime concern. The present research work has utilized Remote Sensing and GIS techniques for assessing vulnerability of the Gujarat coast due to predicted sea level rise. Synergetic use of satellite remote sensing, numerical simulations and filed observations has been done to generate coastal thematic information followed by validation. Coastal vulnerability assessment of the entire Gujarat coast on 1:50,000 scale were carried out considering five physical parameters. They are; coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, shoreline change rate, mean spring tidal range, and significant wave height. The rank values of all the five physical variables are integrated through additive method to compute a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) where the relative ranking is assigned to various coastal segments based on the vulnerability level. The CVI values categorize Gujarat coast into four risk level classes. The results show that 785\xc2\xa0km (45.67\xc2\xa0%) of the Gujarat coast is under high to very high risk category and 934\xc2\xa0km (54.33\xc2\xa0%) of the Gujarat coast is under Moderate to Low risk category due to an anticipated rise in sea level. The coastal regions under very high risk category are along northwestern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat, the northernmost parts of the Gulf of Kachchh and western parts of the Kachchh coast. The southern parts of the Saurashtra coast and southwestern parts of the Kachchh coast is under the low risk category along with isolated segments along the eastern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat. The approach developed for assessing vulnerability of the coast to predicted sea level rise using remote sensing and GIS techniques can be used effectively by coastal management authorities and decision makers to devise better coastal zone management plans as well as to ensure efficient mitigation measures to minimize the losses due to possible impact of predicted sea level rise through which appropriate measures to protect life, property and environment can be timely planned.'

Abstract: ' Sesuvium portulacastrum L. (seapurslane) is a halophyte used as pioneer species in sand dune fixation and stabilization of saline soil. Studies on the morphological and molecular diversity were carried out for the 14 clones of Sesuvium collected from the different coastal regions of India. Significant differences were observed for morphological traits viz., length, width, diameter and area of leaf, internodal distance and stem diameter for different clones when compared with the clone from Gujarat state (GJ1). A UPGMA dendrogram for morphological traits based on the Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s similarity coefficient clustered the clones into three groups considering 80% polymorphism as criteria. Molecular diversity among the clones was studied using Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and markers specific to Ac homologous region. Of the total 749 RAPD loci amplified with 70 random primers, 294 were polymorphic with 39.25% diversity. A phylogenetic tree constructed with UPGMA and SHAN, grouped the clones into three major clades based on RAPD data. The molecular diversity studied with ITS and markers specific to Ac homologous region revealed 37.50% and 66.66% polymorphism and clustered the clones into three and four clades, respectively. The genetic diversity analysis revealed wide variations among the S. portulacastrum clones, reflecting a high level of diversity within the species which might be due to anthropogenic impact and geographic environmental conditions. Further, the various clones from the different eco-geographic coastal localities might have originated from native places of wild abundance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate both morphological and genetic diversity among the Sesuvium clones collected from the distant habitats of the coastal regions of the India.'

Abstract: 'Climate change poses major challenges to agricultural systems in drought prone regions of the world especially in the areas with high poverty, lack of irrigation facilities and low productivity. Towards this it is essential to understand the climate change perceptions, adaptation practices and barriers to effective adaptation at household and community level. This paper using household surveys and focus group discussions in one of the drought prone areas of Odisha in India, explores various aspects of perception on climate change and barriers to adaptation. It also analyses the accuracy of perceptions based on rainfall data from nearest meteorological stations. The study reinforces the argument by earlier studies that the perception by people simply cannot be wrong because they may have a just a low correlation with underlying meteorological data. Results suggest that farmers increasingly perceive the changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns. However, when compared with the trend in actual rainfall data, perceptions on rainfall are found to more closely align with the results from the nearest station as compared to the station farther from it. Analysis revealed that seasonal rainfall variability has a profound influence on the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions on climate change and drought in the study region. Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 are still dependent on the traditional forecasting system because of the lack of access to modern climate forecasting and tailored information for agricultural practice. Although farmers in the study region are already adapting to the changing climate, the study finds that while lack of access to water and irrigation, information on climate change adaptation and early warning systems are major barriers to adaptation at the household level lack of government intervention, lack of knowledge on drought resistant crops and varieties and lack of renovation of water bodies and irrigation were mentioned as the major barriers at the community level. Findings from the paper argue for better adaptation planning at the local level incorporating local level perceptions and barriers to adaptation. In such areas local level planning can be crucial in enhancing the adaptive capacity of the farmers.'

Abstract: 'The neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography emphasizes the importance of dispersal and speciation to macro-ecological diversity patterns. While the influence of dispersal has been studied quite extensively, the effect of speciation has not received much attention, even though it was already claimed at an early stage of neutral theory development that the mode of speciation would leave a signature on metacommunity structure. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the distribution of abundances according to the neutral model with recruitment (i.e., dispersal and establishment) limitation and random fission speciation which seems to be a more realistic description of (allopatric) speciation than the point mutation mode of speciation mostly used in neutral models. We find that the two modes of speciation behave qualitatively differently except when recruitment is strongly limited. Fitting the model to six large tropical tree data sets, we show that it performs worse than the original neutral model with point mutation speciation but yields more realistic predictions for speciation rates, species longevities, and rare species. Interestingly, we find that the metacommunity abundance distribution under random fission is identical to the broken-stick abundance distribution and thus provides a dynamical explanation for this grand old lady of abundance distributions.'

Abstract: '\nA study was carried out to assess tree diversity, forest carbon stock and carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in Nambor tropical semi-evergreen forest. A total of 53 tree species from 47 genera and 32 families were recorded in the forest. Vatica lanceifolia was the dominant tree species with maximum 33.78 importance value index (IVI), 0.30 Shannon diversity index (H\xe2\x80\xb2) and 0.03 Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index (D) followed by Lagerstroemia reginae (20.75 IVI, 0.18 H\xe2\x80\xb2 and 0.004 D), Dysoxylum excelsum (17.70 IVI, 0.20 H\xe2\x80\xb2 and 0.006 D), Sterculia villosa (14.15 IVI, 0.09 H\xe2\x80\xb2 and 0.0007 D) and Toona ciliata (11.60 IVI, 0.07 H\xe2\x80\xb2 and 0.0004 D) as codominant species. Among the forest carbon pools, maximum 50.32% carbon was stored in soil followed by 39.42% in above ground biomass and 10.21, 0.03 and 0.02% in below ground, leaf litter and dead debris pools, respectively. Total ecosystem carbon stock in Nambor forest was estimated to be 244.78\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. The estimated carbon stock was extrapolated over 3700 hectare area and found to be 905186.50\xc2\xa0Mg. The total forest carbon stock was also converted into CO2 equivalents and estimated as 3,322,034.46\xc2\xa0Mg. The study observed that forest ecosystem offsets significant amount of atmospheric CO2; therefore, conservation and management of forest resources are imperative to combat global climate change.'

Abstract: 'The forestry sector can not only sustain its carbon but also has the potential to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. India has maintained approximately 64 Mha of forest cover for the last decade. The rate of afforestation in India is one of the highest among the tropical countries, currently estimated to be 2 Mha per annum. The annual productivity has increased from 0.7 m3 per hactare in 1985 to 1.37 m3 per hectare in 1995. Increase in annual productivity directly indicates an increase in forest biomass and hence higher carbon sequestration potential. The carbon pool for the Indian forests is estimated to be 2026.72 Mt for the year 1995. Estimates of annual carbon uptake increment suggest that our forests and plantations have been able to remove at least 0.125 Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere in the year 1995. Assuming that the present forest cover in India will sustain itself with a marginal annual increase by 0.5 Mha in area of plantations, we can expect our forests to continue to act as a net carbon sink in future.'

Abstract: "Tropical dry forest is the most endangered major vegetation type in the New Caledonia biodiversity hotspot. Vegetation surveys following a transect method used by Gentry were undertaken in two tropical dry forest sites, Ouen-Toro and Pindai, in order to compare species richness, floristic composition, and structure. Pindai contained significantly higher species richness than Ouen-Toro, although there was little difference in forest structure. Tropical dry forest sites in New Caledonia were compared to seven other biodiversity hotspots with tropical dry forest where Gentry's transect method was employed. New Caledonia and other tropical dry forests on islands contain significantly lower species richness than mainland tropical dry forests in biodiversity hotspots. However, New Caledonia contained the highest number of threatened species based on IUCN global conservation categories. Tropical dry forest in New Caledonia appears to be the world's most endangered tropical dry forest based on the extent of forest, number of reserves, and threatened species. Management of tropical dry forests on private and community lands is absolutely imperative to the long-term persistence of this ecosystem."

Abstract: 'Frequent burning and grazing and cultivation of cash crops increasingly threaten forest patches in hilly grassland in Northeast Luzon, yet their importance as a resource with multiple environmental functions and forest products persists. The aim of this study is to identify different types of forest patches, and their condition under present land-use intensification, and discuss prospects for their integration into sustainable local farming systems. Five types of forest patches are distinguished, both natural and planted ones, including rows of trees, woody patches, gallery forests, hill-slope forests and homegarden conglomerations. Natural woody patches and gallery forests in Imperata grassland are subject to degradation and land-use conversion under conditions of agricultural intensification. Woody patches in grassland affected by frequent burning and grazing cover small areas (66% below 50 m2 as opposed to 28% in protected grassland) and contain relatively few woody plant species (25 woody species in total as opposed to 82 where protected). Yet where well managed, they may provide a variety of products for sale and subsistence, covering emergency needs and giving off-season cash income to rural communities. Moreover they serve like the gallery forest various ecological functions, carrying valuable indigenous tree species, retaining soil base nutrients, providing a continuous supply of organic matter and intercepting fine earth soil particles removed from bare surfaces. It is suggested that forest-patch management systems may be developed, taking into account both patch diversity and the diverse needs of rural communities, and to strengthen existing and undervalued functions of forest patches as permanent elements in an agricultural landscape.'

Abstract: 'Mulberry (Morus L.) is essential for the sericulture industry as the primary feed for the silkworm Bombyx mori L. in India, with its long tradition of practicing sericulture, has a large number of indigenous cultivars. Since knowledge on the genetic divergence of these cultivars/varieties is essential for proper conservation and utilization, Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) profiling was employed to assess genetic relationships among 34 mulberry accessions, collected from different regions of India. By using 12 ISSR primers, which produced 72 markers displaying a high degree of polymorphism (94.4%), genetic dissimilarity coefficients were calculated for each pair of the accessions and clustering of the accessions with Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic average (UPGMA) analysis was done to unravel the genetic diversity among the accessions. The dissimilarity coefficients varied from 0.111 to 0.692. UPGMA analysis generated a dendrogram with six groups and five isolates. Clustering of the accessions did not correspond with the information on the geographic origin of many of the accessions. Two-dimensional representations of the relative positions of the accessions with regards to divergence using the first two canonical variates as co-ordinate axes revealed considerable variability among the cases in each group. Further, Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) showed changes in the geographic origin of 11 accessions and species status of 20 accessions.'

Abstract: 'There is evidence that human beings are familiar with use of animals for food, cloth, medicine, etc. since ancient times. Enormous work has been done on ethnobotany and traditional medicine. Like plants, animal and their products are also possessing medicinal properties that can be exploited for the benefit of human beings. In India, many ethnic communities are dispersed all over the country and these people are still totally depended on local traditional medicinal system for their health care. India is gifted with faunal and floral biodiversity, Mount Abu wildlife sanctuary is also one of them, and thus the aim of this work was to take an ethnozoological field survey among Garasiya people (main tribal group of this area) in the adjoining areas of this sanctuary.'

Abstract: 'Protocols for in vitro plant multiplication from somatic tissues and production of artificial seeds through encapsulation of nodes were developed for Aristolochia tagala Cham., a rare and valuable medicinal plant, as a measure of conservation and as a prerequisite for genetic transformation procedure. A maximum number of adventitious shoots were regenerated from leaf-derived callus on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP; 2 \xce\xbcM), \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA; 0.5 \xce\xbcM), and phloroglucinol (PG; 10\xce\xbcM). Nodes collected from in vitro established shoot cultures were encapsulated in 3 % (m/v) sodium alginate and 1 % (m/v) calcium chloride. Multiple shoots were successfully regenerated from the encapsulated nodes cultured on MS medium supplemented with 3 \xce\xbcM BAP and 0.5 \xce\xbcM kinetin (KIN). Regenerated shoots from callus and artificial seeds were successfully rooted and acclimated to greenhouse conditions. Since roots of A. tagala are primarily used in traditional medicine, a protocol for regenerating roots directly from the leaf derived callus was also developed. Maximum root length was obtained when the callus was cultured in MS medium supplemented with KIN (1 \xce\xbcM), indole acetic acid (IAA; 0.5 \xce\xbcM), NAA (0.1 \xce\xbcM), and PG (10 \xce\xbcM). Biochemical parameters were studied in calli grown with and without PG in the medium to establish a correlation between these parameters and shoot morphogenesis. An increment of antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase and catalase) and metabolites (sugars and proteins), and a decrease in the amount of polyphenol oxidase was observed in the calli which were grown in the presence of PG.'

Abstract: 'In vitro propagation protocol was developed for Saussurea lappa (Clarke.) species threatened by over exploitation due to medicinal importance and habitat destruction in Ladakh region of India. The aim of the present study was to examine the main aspects of in vitro callus induction (CI) and plantlet regeneration of S. lappa. Explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with various concentrations and combinations of auxins and cytokinins for in vitro CI and plantlets regeneration. Callus initiation and induction was observed within eight and fifteen days after inoculation. 3\xc2\xa0mg/L 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and 5\xc2\xa0mg/L Kinetin (Kin) was found to be more effective for CI frequencies in all the explants as compared to other combinations. Root (79.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.8) and stem (76.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.6) explants were found with better callus frequencies and early response as compared to other explants. Maximum number of shoots (11.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.7), highest shoot length (9.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.6\xc2\xa0cm), maximum root number (6.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.7) and highest root length (6.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.8\xc2\xa0cm) were found on MS medium with 2\xc2\xa0mg/L Kinetin (Kin) and 2\xc2\xa0mg/L Indole-3-butyric-acid in root derived callus explant. Plantlets with 3\xe2\x80\x935 shoots were transferred to potting mixture containing sand: soil: perlite (1:1:1) for acclimatization to field conditions and further multiplication. For the first time, protocol has been developed in S. lappa for in vitro CI and plantlet regeneration that holds robust potential for metabolite production and large-scale propagation.'

Abstract: 'Global scale drivers such as international markets for shrimp can trigger large changes at local and regional scales. But there is also a poorly appreciated reverse process, operating from the bottom up, with potential for triggering changes at higher scales. Thus, effects of drivers can be seen as a two-way process in which global drivers and local and regional drivers can potentially impact each other. Here, we argue that not only can global drivers impact the sustainability of local and regional social-ecological systems, but sustainability at higher scales can also be impacted by changes at the scale of local and regional social-ecological systems. Using Chilika, a large lagoon on the Bay of Bengal, Odisha State in India as a case, we show that traditional small-scale capture fisheries supporting 150 fisher villages with some 400,000 people were marginalized by aquaculture development for tiger prawn and by state-driven hydrological interventions, with impacts on the ecology of the lagoon. These changes, in turn, contribute to global poverty and food insecurity, making it difficult for India to meet international targets such as millennium development goals. The marginalized fisherfolk become part of environmental justice and other social movements. With large parts of the lagoon converted into a virtual monoculture for the production of tiger prawn, changes in Chilika (a Ramsar site) contribute to wetland habitat loss at the global scale, and biodiversity losses, possibly including IUCN red-listed species.'

Abstract: 'Land use is a main driver of global biodiversity loss and its environmental relevance is widely recognized in research on life cycle assessment (LCA). The inherent spatial heterogeneity of biodiversity and its non-uniform response to land use requires a regionalized assessment, whereas many LCA applications with globally distributed value chains require a global scale. This paper presents a first approach to quantify land use impacts on biodiversity across different world regions and highlights uncertainties and research needs.'

Title: 'Primate population decline in response to habitat loss: Borajan Reserve Forest of Assam, India'
Author: 'Arun\xc2\xa0Srivastava'

URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02629631
Abstract: 'Systematic studies of the Borajan Reserve Forest in Assam, India, were conducted in 1995, 1997, and 1998. Initially this small (5 km2) forest was inhabited by substantial numbers of five species of diurnal primates and the forest was typical of Reserve Forests in northwest upper Assam. About two thirds of the forest had canopy cover of 20 \xe2\x80\x93 50% or more. Civil unrest, political problems and a lack of resources for Forest Department personnel, however, resulted in rapid degradation of the area. After three years less than one third of the forest had more than 20% canopy cover; all primate populations had declined dramatically and the small percentage of juveniles in each species indicated that all were in imminent danger of local extinction. There was no evidence of hunting or trapping nor any large scale logging. Forest degradation was due primarily to small scale harvesting of forest products, selective cutting, and collection of firewood. Although only hand tools were employed, the forest inexorably declined in response to these steady pressures. Borajan may be an object lesson as to what can happen but it need not be the harbinger of Assam\xe2\x80\x99s future.'

Abstract: 'Soil erosion is a serious environmental problem in Indravati catchment. It carries the highest amount of sediments compared with other catchments in India. This catchment spreading an area of 41,285\xc2\xa0km2 is drained by river Indravati, which is one of the northern tributaries of the river Godavari in its lower reach. In the present study, USLE is used to estimate potential soil erosion from river Indravati catchment. Both magnitude and spatial distribution of potential soil erosion in the catchment is determined. The derived soil loss map from USLE model is classified into six categories ranging from slight to very severe risk depending on the calculated soil erosion amount. The soil erosion map is linked to elevation and slope maps to identify the area for conservation practice in order to reduce the soil loss. From the model output predictions, it is found that average erosion rate predicted is 18.00 tons/ha/year and sediment yield at the out let of the catchment is 22.30 Million tons per annum. The predicted sediment yield verified with the observed data.'

Abstract: 'Crop and livestock losses to wildlife are a concern for people neighboring many protected areas (PAs) and can generate opposition to conservation. Examining patterns of conflict and associated tolerance is important to devise policies to reduce conflict impacts on people and wildlife. We surveyed 398 households from 178 villages within 10\xc2\xa0km of Ranthambore, Kanha, and Nagarahole parks in India. We compared different attitudes toward wildlife, and presented hypothetical response scenarios, including killing the problem animal(s). Eighty percent of households reported crop losses to wildlife and 13\xc2\xa0% livestock losses. Higher crop loss was associated with more cropping months per year, greater crop variety, and more harvest seasons per year but did not vary with proximity to the PA, suggesting that PAs are not necessarily \xe2\x80\x9csources\xe2\x80\x9d for crop raiders. By contrast, complaints of \xe2\x80\x9cdepredating carnivores\xe2\x80\x9d were associated with people-grazing animals and collecting resources from PAs. Many households (83\xc2\xa0%) engaged in mitigation efforts. We found that only fencing and guard animals reduce crop losses, and no efforts to lower livestock losses. Contrary to our expectations, carnivores were not viewed with more hostility than crop-raiding wildlife. Households reported greater inclination to kill herbivores destroying crops or carnivores harming people, but not carnivores preying on livestock. Our model estimated crop loss was 82\xc2\xa0% across surveyed households (highest in Kanha), while the livestock loss experienced was 27\xc2\xa0% (highest in Ranthambore). Our comparative study provides insights into factors associated with conflict loss and tolerance, and aids in improving ongoing conservation and compensation efforts.'

Abstract: 'Swaziland is a small, topographically diverse southern Africa country whose mammalian fauna has been poorly studied. The distributions of small mammals in Swaziland were surveyed at 39 localities. A total of 15 species of rodents and ten species of insectivores were captured during the survey. The number of species of insectivore captured at a locality was positively correlated with mean annual rainfall, while the number of rodent species captured was negatively correlated with altitude. The number of rodent species captured was lower on Swazi Nation Land compared with privately owned land or protected land (reserves). This was probably due to the radical habitat alteration that had taken place on Swazi Nation Land, inter alia overgrazing by livestock, cultivation of maize and deforestation. The effect of this habitat alteration on the number of rodent species was more pronounced in high-lying areas of Swaziland. This may have been due to the fact that a large number of the rodent species inhabiting high-lying areas require thick, tall grassland habitats, whereas many of the low-lying species prefer more open habitats with less grass cover. Since grazing acts to reduce grass cover, it is suggested that the species inhabiting high-lying areas would be more affected by overgrazing, than low-lying species.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents a rain duration-dependent procedure based on the popular Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) methodology for computation of direct surface runoff from long duration rains. Curve numbers are derived from long-term daily rainfall-runoff data, and antecedent moisture condition (AMC) related with antecedent duration. Analysis of data from five Indian (large, in terms of area) watersheds reveals the calculated curve numbers to decrease with the considered duration, showing the existence of a characteristic value of minimum CN or maximum initial abstraction to occur in a watershed for a pre-selected AMC. The testing of the proposed procedure on the separate (measured) rainfall-runoff event data sets from the same watersheds suggests satisfactory workability of the method.'

Abstract: 'Thirty-five new microsatellite loci from the sea cucumbers Holothurian scabra (Jaeger, 1833) and Apostichopus japonicas (Selenka, 1867) were screened and characterized using the method of magnetic bead enrichment. Of the twenty-four polymorphic loci tested, eighteen were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after a modified false discovery rate (B-Y FDR) correction, whereas six showed statistically significant deviations (CHS2 and CHS11: P<0.014 790; FCS1, FCS6, FCS8 and FCS14: P<0.015 377). Furthermore, four species of plesiomorphous and related sea cucumbers (Holothurian scabra, Holothuria leucospilota, Stichopus horrens and Apostichopus japonicas) were tested for mutual cross-amplification using a total of ninety microsatellite loci. Although transferability and universality of all loci were generally low, the results of the cross-species study showed that the markers can be applied to identify individuals to species according to the presence or absence of specific microsatellite alleles. The microsatellite markers reported here will contribute to the study of genetic diversity, assisted breeding, and population conservation in sea cucumbers, as well as allow for the identification of individuals to closely related species.'

Abstract: 'Macrofungi play an extraordinarily important role in the catalysis of the nutrient cycle of deciduous and coniferous forests. Habitat degradation adversely influences the number of fruiting bodies of macrofungi and diminishes the diversity of the fungal community. The diversity of the terricolous- and lignicolous macrofungi assemblages were compared in stands of semi-natural and two plant associations modified by humans in different degrees in North-East Hungary. We used data from 15 permanent plots that were sampled for vascular plants and macrofungi. Rank-abundance curves and R\xc3\xa9nyi\xe2\x80\x99s diversity profiles were applied for diversity research. The results indicated that structure and diversity of the terricolous macrofungi assemblages were mainly influenced by climatic and habitat conditions and the degradation of the plant associations to a lesser degree. The diversity of lignicolous macrofungi was primarily affected by the continuous presence, quality, and quantity of deadwood. Accordingly, the form and degree of forest management, as well as the age of the growing stocks, influenced community structure. If nature conservation planning and conservation activity are based on those biodiversity indicators which are good proxies for macrofungi biodiversity, the latter might be optimal for preserving macrofungi biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'While deliberations relating to negative consequences of large dams on the environment continue to dominate world attention, positive benefits provided by small dams, also known as check dams, go unobserved. Besides, little is known about the potential of check dams in mitigating global warming impacts due to less data availability. Small dams are usually commissioned to private contractors who do not have clear mandate from their employers to post their work online for public scrutiny. As a result, statistics on the design, cost, and materials used to build check dams are not available in public domain. However, this review paper presents data for the first time on the often ignored potential of check dams mitigating climate-induced hydrological threats. We hope that the scientific analysis presented in this paper will promote further research on check dams worldwide to better comprehend their eco-friendly significance serving society.'

Abstract: 'The CC genome of Oryza is found in nine species of Oryza that are distributed on all continents having a tropical climate. Three diploid Oryza species with CC genome are found in Africa and Asia to Papua New Guinea. In southern South Asia these three CC genome diploid species can be found, O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis in Sri Lanka and O. officinalis in India. AA genome wild relatives of rice are also found in the same geographic region. Germplasm of both diploid CC and AA genome Oryza germplasm has recently been collected from Sri Lanka. AFLP analysis was used to compare the genetic diversity of the two Oryza genomes from a similar geographic region in southern South Asia. In addition, the diploid CC Oryza germplasm was also analyzed by RAPD and SSR methodologies and the combined results were analyzed. The results show that in southern South Asia the diploid CC genome species have a high level of genetic diversity compared to the diploid AA genome species. Molecular marker analysis revealed that populations of O. rhizomatis from northern and southeastern Sri Lanka are genetically differentiated. One accession of O. rhizomatis was aligned with O. eichingeri. This accession was collected from the site of O. rhizomatis that is the closest to a population of O. eichingeri. O. eichingeri showed lower genetic diversity than the other two diploid Oryza CC genome species. O. officinalis accessions from Assam, India, and China were genetically less diverged from O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis than two accessions of O. officinalis from Kerala state, India.'

Abstract: 'Resistance to stem rust and leaf rust in five D genome species of wheat viz., 267 accessions of Aegilops tauschii Coss., 39 of Ae. cylindrica Host, 17 of Ae. ventricosa Tausch, 4 of Ae. crassa Boiss. and 8 of Ae. juvenalis (Thell.) Eig were evaluated at adult plant stage. Two hundred and thirty nine (90\xc2\xa0%) accessions of Ae. tauschii, 30 (77\xc2\xa0%) of Ae. cylindrica, 16 (94\xc2\xa0%) of Ae. ventricosa, 3 (75\xc2\xa0%) of Ae. crassa Boiss. and 5 (62.5\xc2\xa0%) of Ae. juvenalis were resistant to stem rust pathotypes prevalent in South India at Wellington under field condition. Invariably, all the accessions of the five species were resistant to leaf rust pathotypes. Quantitative measurement of disease using area under the disease progress curve revealed the slow progress of disease in the resistant accessions compared to susceptible check (Agra Local). Since all the five species have D genome, it could be concluded that the genes present in D genome might play a vital role in leaf rust resistance, but in case of stem rust resistance wide range of differential response was noticed. Among the species evaluated, Ae. tauschii was exploited to a larger extent, followed by Ae. ventricosa and Ae. cylindrica for leaf and stem rust resistance because of the homology of D genome with hexaploid bread wheat. While, Ae. crassa and Ae. juvenalis could not be utilized so far, possibly due to partial homology which makes the transfer of traits difficult. So, these species have considerable potential as a source of rust resistance and may enhance the existing gene pool of resistance to stem and leaf rusts.'

Abstract: '\nA new epithelial cell line, Horabagrus brachysoma fin (HBF), was established from the caudal fin tissue of yellow catfish, H. brachysoma and characterized. This HBF cell line was maintained in Leibovitz\xe2\x80\x99s-15 medium supplemented with 15\xc2\xa0% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and subcultured more than 62 times over a period of 20\xc2\xa0months. The HBF cell line consists predominantly of epithelial cells and is able to grow at temperatures between 20 and 35\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C with an optimum temperature of 28\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. The growth rate of these cells increased as the proportion of FBS increased from 5 to 20\xc2\xa0% at 28\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C with optimum growth at the concentrations of 15\xc2\xa0% FBS. Partial amplification and sequencing of fragments of two mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA and COI confirmed that HBF cell line originated from yellow catfish. The HBF cells showed strong positive reaction to the cytokeratin marker, indicating that it was epithelial in nature. HBF cell line was inoculated with tissue homogenate from juveniles of Sea bass, Lates calcarifer infected with viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV) and found not susceptible to VNNV. The extracellular products of Vibrio cholerae MTCC 3904 were toxic to the HBF cells. These cells were confirmed for the absence of Mycoplasma sp by PCR.\n'

Abstract: 'We investigated the study on the endemic and endangered species of Dawkinsia tambraparniei were confined only the areas of the river Tamiraparani. These species are under threats due to the menace of anthropogenic stress. To recognize the crisis behind the particular species, it was analyzed histologically and molecularly from the five pollutant levels of river Tamiraparani. Histologically, the microscopic examinations were also carried out from the crucial organs such as the brain, gill, heart, kidney, and liver, which confirm the spiky survivability of the endemic fish. Assessment of fish organ damages was observed highly in Kokkirakulam and Vannarapettai. Probably with conserved molecular sequences, the species can be identified out from the encountered surveillance of the particular taxa leading to the evolutionary circumstances. The phylogenetic analysis of Dawkinsia tambraparniei populations showed that Cheranmadevi and Vallandau sites populations were closely distributed.

Abstract: 'Mikania micrantha (Asteraceae: Eupatorieae), widely called mile-a-minute, has been a persistent problem to forestry, plantations and biodiversity conservation in southwestern and northeastern India, as well as in Andaman and Nicobar islands. To supplement the previously imported Trinidad-originating Puccinia spegazzinii (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae), a different pathotype (IMI 393076) was imported from Peru, South America, after obtaining the import permit from the Plant Protection Advisor to the Government of India. The Peruvian pathotype was held in the National Containment-cum-Quarantine Facility for Transgenic Planting Material at ICAR\xe2\x80\x93National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources in New Delhi as a quarantine organism for pre-release evaluation. Screening of M. micrantha populations from Andaman and Nicobar islands (12), Assam (15) and Kerala (3) indicated their complete susceptibility to the Peruvian pathotype. In the host-specificity tests, the rust could not infect any of the 25 plant species in ten tribes within Asteraceae, which confirmed its safety to non-target plant species. Further, none of the 31 sunflower cultivars/accessions screened were infected.'

Title: "Valorizing the 'Irulas' traditional knowledge of medicinal plants in the Kodiakkarai Reserve Forest, India"

Abstract: 'A mounting body of critical research is raising the credibility of Traditional Knowledge (TK) in scientific studies. These studies have gained credibility because their claims are supported by methods that are repeatable and provide data for quantitative analyses that can be used to assess confidence in the results. The theoretical importance of our study is to test consensus (reliability/replicable) of TK within one ancient culture; the Irulas of the Kodiakkarai Reserve Forest (KRF), India. We calculated relative frequency (RF) and consensus factor (Fic) of TK from 120 Irulas informants knowledgeable of medicinal plants. Our research indicates a high consensus of the Irulas TK concerning medicinal plants. The Irulas revealed a diversity of plants that have medicinal and nutritional utility in their culture and specific ethnotaxa used to treat a variety of illnesses and promote general good health in their communities. Throughout history aboriginal people have been the custodians of bio-diversity and have sustained healthy life-styles in an environmentally sustainable manner. However this knowledge has not been transferred to modern society. We suggest this may be due to the asymmetry between scientific and TK, which demands a new approach that considers the assemblage of TK and scientific knowledge. A greater understanding of TK is beginning to emerge based on our research with both the Irulas and Malasars; they believe that a healthy lifestyle is founded on a healthy environment. These aboriginal groups chose to share this knowledge with society-at-large in order to promote a global lifestyle of health and environmental sustainability.'

Abstract: 'The spatial distribution of basidiocarps of the ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycete Russula subsect. Foetentinae was assessed in a primary forest in the Western Gh\xc3\xa2ts (India) dominated by the ectomycorrhizal tree species Vateria indica and Dipterocarpus indicus. Over a 7,700-m2 sampling area, both trees and basidiocarps of Russula subsect. Foetentinae were mapped during the first month of the 2002 rainy season. First-order spatial analysis revealed that the distribution of the 45 collected carpophores was highly aggregated, with 60% of all basidiocarps located at a distance lower than 1\xc2\xa0m from the nearest one. The genetic structure of the Russula subsect. Foetentinae population was studied by inter-simple sequence repeat polymorphism analysis using three primers. Eighteen of the 45 genotypes were represented by single basidiocarps. Twenty-seven basidiocarps were identified as belonging to 11 genets or separated ramets. Five genets were small, with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 5\xc2\xa0m. The six others were large, with a diameter ranging from 31\xc2\xa0m to a maximum measured distance of 70\xc2\xa0m. In spite of the lack of data concerning the reproductive biology of this species, the presence of large genets suggests that mature stands may shelter well-spread underground mycelium, crucial for durable interaction with plant partner.'

Abstract: 'The genotypes of black pepper are morphologically and genotypically highly diverse and carry all the cumulative variations inherited and maintained through generations. The present study describes the Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) or microsatellite based assessment of genetic diversity among forty popular genotypes and four different species of black pepper in Southern region of India. For isolation of SSR primers, our earlier attempts with enrichment strategies like \xe2\x80\x98Triplex affinity capture\xe2\x80\x99 did not extract a single SSR primer due to close proximity of restriction sites to the SSR motif. Hence we developed a \xe2\x80\x98Sequential Reverse Genome Walking (SRGW)\xe2\x80\x99 strategy with better enrichment efficiency of 72% that generated seven new SSR primers. Genotyping precisely discriminated majority of genotypes which indicated that the SSR primers are very informative. A total of 62 alleles with an average of 15.5 alleles over 4 loci were identified. All the SSR primers showed an average Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) value of 0.85. The estimated average Shared Allele Frequency ranged between 1.57 and 20.12%. The PCA plot revealed four closely related individual groups and identified Karimunda, Wild pepper and a local landrace \xe2\x80\x98local b\xe2\x80\x99 as the most divergent genotypes. Cluster analysis exposed the genetic relatedness between hybrids and selections with other known cultivars. The introduction of black pepper from South India to Malaysia was emphasized from the observation of genetic similarity of Malaysian cultivar \xe2\x80\x98Kuching\xe2\x80\x99 with other indigenous popular cultivars. The study was first to portray the precise genetic relatedness among the major indigenous genotypes of black pepper.'

Abstract: 'The community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the roots of drought-resistant trees, Moringa spp., was examined in semiarid regions in Madagascar and Uganda. Root samples were collected from 8 individuals of M. hildebrandtii and 2 individuals of M. drouhardii in Madagascar and from 21 individuals of M. oleifera in Uganda. Total DNA was extracted from the root samples, and partial nSSU rDNA of AM fungi was amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer NS31 and an AM fungalspecific primer AM1. The PCR products were cloned and divided by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with HinfI and RsaI. Some representatives in each RFLP types were sequenced, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was conducted for the obtained sequences with analogous sequences of AM fungi. The RFLP and phylogenetic analyses showed that AM fungi closely related to Glomus intraradices or G. sinuosum were detected in many samples. The AM fungal groups frequently detected in the Moringa spp. might be widely distributed species in semiarid environments.'

Abstract: 'Groundwater quality of the Tiruppur district in Tamil Nadu was investigated in this study to develop a Water Quality Index (WQI) model. Hydrochemical parameters showed tremendous variation in certain location over the seasons. Ionic chemistry of groundwater suggested that textile industries and rock-water interaction are major threats to the water quality. Analysis of Na and Ca concentration indicates that direct as well as the inverse cation exchange controls the natural cation chemistry. NO3 concentration shows that the pre-monsoon samples were affected by the fertilizer usage in agricultural fields. Na-Cl type of the water was dominant throughout the study area except few locations. WQI showed that 55% of the pre-monsoon samples and the 47% of the post monsoon samples were classified as poor/very poor/unsuitable for drinking category. Leaching of the textile waste and their transport to the downstream was well observed during the post-monsoon season. The specific contribution of river Noyyal in the transport of the solutes to the discharge zones was proved by the hydrochemistry of the samples.'

Abstract: 'The present study outlines an approach to classify forest density and to estimate canopy closure of the forest of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. The vector layers generated for the study area using satellite data was validated with the field knowledge of the surveyed ground control points. The methodology adopted in this present analysis is three-tiered. First, the density stratification into five zones using visual interpretation for the complete archipelago. In the second step, we identified two island groups from the Andaman to investigate and compare the forest strata density. The third and final step involved more of a localised phytosociological module that focused on the North Andaman Islands. The results based on the analysis of the high-resolution satellite data show that more than 75% of the mangroves are under high- to very high-density canopy class. The framework developed would serve as a significant measure to forest health and evaluate management concerns whilst addressing issues such as gap identification, conservation prioritisation and disaster management\xe2\x80\x94principally to the post-tsunami assessment and analysis.'

Abstract: 'Sustainable food production is one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century in the era of global environmental problems such as climate change, increasing population and natural resource degradation including soil degradation and biodiversity loss. Climate change is among the greatest threats to agricultural systems. Green Revolution though multiplied agricultural production several folds but at the huge environmental cost including climate change. It jeopardized the ecological integrity of agroecosystems by intensive use of fossil fuels, natural resources, agrochemicals and machinery. Moreover, it threatened the age-old traditional agricultural practices. Agriculture is one of the largest sectors that sustain livelihood to maximum number of people and contribute to climate change. Therefore, a climate-smart approach to sustainable food production is the need of hour. Traditional agriculture is getting increased attention worldwide in context of sustainable food production in changing climate. The present article advocates traditional agriculture as a climate-smart approach for the sustainable food production and also deliberates the correlation between climate change and agriculture.'

Abstract: 'The study explores the use of multiple criteria decision techniques in predicting spatial niche of Brown oak (also known as Kharsu oak, Quercus semecarpifolia Sm.) formation in midaltitude (2,400\xe2\x80\x933,500 meter amsl) Kumaun Himalaya. Predictive models using various climatic and topographical factors influencing Brown oak\xe2\x80\x99s growth and survival were developed to define its current ecological niche. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method involving Saaty\xe2\x80\x99s pair-wise comparison was performed to rank the explanatory powers of each compared variable. Variables were suitably weighted using fuzzy factor standardization scheme to reflect their relative importance in defining species niche. An optimum indicator was then chosen for deriving a site suitability map of brown oak. This study establishes the role of aspect in the current distribution of the species along with known influence of altitude. Future niches of oak has been tracked in the projected climate change scenario of +1\xc2\xb0C and +2\xc2\xb0C rise in temperature and 20 mm in precipitation. The results show that on predicted +1\xc2\xb0C and +2\xc2\xb0C increase in temperature, present habitat of brown oak distribution may be reduced by 40 per cent and 76 per cent respectively.'

Title: 'A new index to describe the tropical Asian summer monsoon'

Abstract: 'We define a new monsoon index (MV) as the product of relative vorticity and equivalent potential temperature using the long-term NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. The MV index provides new insights into the intraseasonal and interannual variabilities of the broad-scale tropical Asian summer monsoon (TASM), including the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) and the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM). On the intraseasonal timescale, the pentad-to-pentad MV index bears a close relationship to the broad-scale rainfall in the TASM regions. Among 29 summers from 1979 to 2007, in 23/27 summers the correlation coefficients are higher than 0.7 in the SASM/SCSSM region. However, in fewer than 9 summers, the correlations between the broad-scale rainfall and the existing circulation indices are higher than 0.7. On the interannual timescale, various existing SASM circulation indices are moderately or well correlated with all-India summer monsoon rainfall, whereas their correlations with broad-scale SASM rainfall are weak. In contrast, the summer mean MV index correlates well with the broad-scale SASM rainfall and all-India summer monsoon rainfall (correlation of 0.73 and 0.65, respectively). In the SCSSM region, the summer mean MV index also bears a close relationship to the SCSSM rainfall, although some discrepancies exist during certain years. The composite strong TASM shows a stronger low-tropospheric low pressure in association with the enhanced westerly winds and moisture transfer, stronger convection, and upper-tropospheric easterly winds, which indicate that the MV index can well capture the features of TASM.'

Abstract: 'In an age of Anthropocene, the urban landscapes are recognised as the \xe2\x80\x98hotspots\xe2\x80\x99 of human-mediated alien species introductions. As the cities provide an ideal natural experimental system to investigate the patterns of alien plant diversity in urban landscapes, the present study aimed to unravel the taxonomic, biogeographic and ecological patterns of alien flora of Srinagar\xe2\x80\x94one of the largest urban centres in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. The alien flora of Srinagar comprises 325 species, constituting ca.35% of total flora of the city. Out of the 325 alien species documented, 157 species (43%) were recorded to be under cultivation, while 168 species (57%) were growing in the wild (i.e., outside cultivation); those growing in the wild, in turn, comprised 110 cultivation escapes and 58 accidentally introduced plant species. Biogeographically, two-third of the alien plant diversity reported from Srinagar is native to Asia-Temperate. This indicates that climatic similarity between Asia-Temperate and Kashmir Himalayas facilitate in flourishing similar floristic diversity. The study highlights a relatively higher proportion of herbaceous growth form in the aliens growing in the wild (80%) than those under cultivation (43%). Similarly, 82% of the alien species under cultivation had a perennial life span, but those growing in the wild were dominated by annuals (44%). Currently, 45 species are growing as casuals and 124 species are naturalised (including 105 naturalised non-invasive and 19 naturalised invasive). Along the continuum of casual-naturalised-invasive categories, the contribution of cultivation escapes and accidently introduced aliens contrastingly shows decreasing and increasing trends respectively. Interestingly, the results revealed that the human practice of stopping cultivation of alien escapes increased rapidly as we move along the continuum. Thus, the present study has investigated the patterns of alien plant diversity in the urban landscape of Srinagar, and the results obtained offer scientific insights toward better scientific understanding and management of plant invasions in this Himalayan city, with wider policy implications for neighbouring urbanised landscapes in the Himalayas and other mountainous regions across the world.'

Abstract: 'Plantation forests not only impact carbon and water cycles, but also affect biodiversity, livelihoods, and shape regional economies. Each of these impacts differs across varying scales of analysis. This paper illustrates how forest, climate change and hydrology debates play out in the context of the forest plantations of Australian black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) in the upper Palni hills of southern India. We outline the contradictory perspectives of different local groups regarding the impact of plantations on catchment hydrology and water availability, and examine these in relation to changes in the regional economy and rainfall patterns. Our analysis indicates that changes in these two factors have played a more significant role than existing wattle plantations in affecting local and regional water availability. We suggest that ongoing debates regarding forest plantation\xe2\x80\x93hydrology\xe2\x80\x93climate change relationships need to broaden their scope to include changes in regional rainfall patterns and shifts in regional economic activity. This approach is likely to provide a more realistic assessment of plantation forests in a dynamic regional context, and offer more resilient strategies for regional landscape and catchment management under conditions of high variability in rainfall patterns.'

Abstract: 'Garcinia gummi-gutta, popularly known as Malabar tamarind or kodampuli is a\xc2\xa0tropical fruit tree species of high potential. Acidic fruits are used either in raw or pickled form. Fruit is highly prized for its anti-obesity property owing to high hydroxycitric acid content in its rind. Though generally cultivated for its fruits, the plant has multifaceted uses in paint manufacturing industry, as medicine, source of edible fat etc. The present study concerned comparative morphological and physicochemical analysis of two morphotypes of Malabar tamarind, which revealed significant differences among them. Fruits and leaves of these morphotypes had distinctive morphological features. A\xc2\xa0morphotype with higher rind recovery and fruit weight was identified for further crop improvement programmes. Further, dimethylsulphoxide was identified as better solvent for extraction of photosynthetic pigments, and hence could be recommended for future physiological studies.'

Abstract: 'Coleus forskohlii is an endangered multipurpose medicinal plant that has widespread applications. In spite of this, there have been few attempts to propagate its cultivation in India. The present communication presents an in vitro rapid regeneration method using leaf explants of Coleus forskohlii through direct organogenesis. Leaf explants that were excised into three different segments i.e. proximal (P), middle (M) and distal (D) were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with cytokinins. MS Media containing 5.0 mg L\xe2\x88\x921 BAP (6-Benzylaminopurine) promoted regeneration of multiple shoots through direct organogenesis from the leaf, which were further elongated on MS media augmented with 0.1 mg L-1 BAP and 0.1 mg L\xe2\x88\x921 IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid), cytokinin and auxin combination. Regenerated and elongated shoots, when transferred to ose resulted in profuse rooting plants that were transferred to soil after acclimatization and maintained in a green house. The current protocol offers a direct, mass propagation method bypassing the callus phase of C. forskohlii and is suitable for conservation, large-scale commercial cultivation, and genetic transformation with agronomically desirable traits.'

A maximum of 93.3\xc2\xa0% of the cultures responded after 6\xc2\xa0weeks of culture on MS medium containing 3.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 of thidiazuron, 0.75\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid and 1.75\xc2\xa0mM spermidine forming 46.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.58 somatic embryos per 500\xc2\xa0mg callus. Individual somatic embryo was encapsulated in calcium alginate beads to produce artificial seeds (ASs). The ASs were stored at 4, 15, and 24\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C temperatures up to 180\xc2\xa0days. The ASs showed 57.8\xc2\xa0% germinability even after 4\xc2\xa0months of storage at 15\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. Plantlets were acclimatized with a survival rate of 96.0\xc2\xa0% and after 13\xe2\x80\x9314\xc2\xa0months, 92.4\xc2\xa0% of these plants produced flowers. Chromosomal studies revealed cytological stability of the regenerants containing 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa030 chromosomes in root tips and n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa015 chromosomes in pollen grains, same as parental plants. The meiotic behaviour of the regenerants is also similar to that of parental plants. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed that there is no somaclonal variations among the plants produced via somatic embryogenesis and they are true-to-type to their parental plant. These results confirm the very reliable method for short-term conservation and large-scale production of true-to-type plantlets of L. revoluta, which can be applied in pharmaceutical industries.'

Abstract: 'Indigenous knowledge has influenced native species selection in agroforestry systems worldwide.  However, scientific advancements in plant sciences, agroforestry technologies and trade have accelerated species movements and establishment beyond their native range.  Managing native and non-native species is an important area of research in agroforestry and this thematic issue includes 13 papers that cover a range of topics from the role of non-native species in agroforestry to management interventions to improve yield.  As evident from these papers, non-native plants are still an important component of agroforestry in many parts of the world.  Whether native or non-native, management interventions can increase the economic, environmental and social values of these species and that of agroforestry.  Collectively, these papers attest to the increasing body of foundational knowledge in agroforestry.'

Abstract: 'Treefall gap, canopy opening caused by the death of one or more trees, is the dominant form of disturbance in many forest systems worldwide. Gaps play an important role in forest ecology helping to preserve bio- and pedo-diversity, influencing nutrient cycles, and maintaining the complex structure of the late-successional forests. Over the last 30 years, numerous reviews have been written describing gap dynamics. Here we synthesize current understanding on gap dynamics relating to tree regeneration with particular emphasis on gap characteristics considered critical to develop ecologically sustainable forest management systems and to conserve native biodiversity. Specifically, we addressed the question: how do gaps influence forest structure? From the literature reviewed, the size of gaps induces important changes in factors such as light intensity, soil humidity and soil biological properties that influence tree species regeneration and differ in gaps of different sizes. Shadetolerant species can colonize small gaps; shade-intolerant species need large gaps for successful regeneration. Additionally, gap dynamics differ between temperate, boreal, and tropical forests, showing the importance of climate differences in driving forest regeneration. This review summarizes information of use to forest managers who design cutting regimes that mimic natural disturbances and who must consider forest structure, forest climate, and the role of natural disturbance in their designs.'

Abstract: 'The south west coast of Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu, India, is significantly affected by seawater intrusion and diffusion of pollutants into the aquifers due to unregulated beach placer mining and other anthropogenic activities. The present study investigates the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers using Geographic Information System (GIS)-based DRASTIC model. The seven DRASTIC parameters have been analyzed using the statistical equation of this model to demarcate the vulnerable zones for aquifer contamination. The vulnerability index map is prepared from the weighted spatial parameters, and an accounting of total index value ranged from 85 to 213. Based on the categorization of vulnerability classes, the high vulnerable zones are found near the beach placer mining areas between Manavalakurichi and Kodimanal coastal stretches. The aquifers associated with settlements and agricultural lands in the middle\xe2\x80\x93eastern part have experienced high vulnerability due to contaminated water bodies. Similarly, the coastal areas of Thengapattinam and Manakudi estuary and around the South Tamaraikulam have also been falling under high vulnerability condition due to backwater and saltpan. In general, the nearshore region except the placer mining zone and the backwater has a moderately vulnerable condition, and the vulnerability index values range from 149 to180. Significantly, the northern and northeastern uplands and some parts of deposition zones in the middle\xe2\x80\x93south coast have been identified as low to no vulnerable conditions. They are structurally controlled by various geological features such as charnockite, garnet biotite gneiss and granites, and sand dunes, respectively. The aquifer vulnerability assessment has been cross-verified by geochemical indicators such as total dissolved solids (TDS), Cl\xe2\x88\x92, HCO3 \xe2\x88\x92, and Cl\xe2\x88\x92/HCO3 \xe2\x88\x92 ratio. The high ranges of TDS (1,842\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x933,736\xc2\xa0mg/l) and Cl\xe2\x88\x92 (1,412\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x932,112\xc2\xa0mg/l) values are well correlated with the observed high vulnerable zones in the study area. The Cl\xe2\x88\x92/HCO3 \xe2\x88\x92 ratio (7.13 to 12.18) of the high vulnerable zone obviously indicates deterioration of the aquifer contamination. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to evaluate sensitivity of the individual DRASTIC parameters to aquifer vulnerability. This reveals the net recharge rate and groundwater table depth are becoming more sensitive to aquifer contamination. It is realized that the GIS is an effective platform for aquifer vulnerability mapping with reliable accuracy, and hence, the study is more useful for sustainable water resource management and the aquifer conservation.'

Abstract: 'Shrubs belonging to Carissa genus (Apocyanaceae family) are potential sources of food, medicine and fuel, yet they are wallowing under obscurity and rarely been exploited. Edibility of the pulpy Carissa fruits is known to only a meagre few. Since antiquity, the stem, root bark, leaves, fruit and seed extracts have been used in folklore medication. Now, the emerging scientific investigations are validating the ethno-medicinal uses of these species. Bioactive compounds which include viz. polyphenolics, flavonoids, flavanones, lignans and sesquiterpenes imparting therapeutic potential to these species have been isolated. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown these species to have antioxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, wound healing, antimicroabial, antidiabetic, antiepileptic, anticancer, diuretic, nephrotoxicity amelioration and hepatoprotective activity. This miraculous plant extract has also been effective in the management of veterinary ailments. Apart from the medicinal attributes, this genus also holds promise as a suitable alternative crop for harvesting renewable energy. Micropropagtion is being tried for rapid multiplication of the valuable species. This review summarizes the recent findings for promoting the versatility of this genus.'

Title: 'How global climate change and regional disturbance can expand the invasion risk? Case study of Lantana camara invasion in the Himalaya'

Abstract: 'Presently, it is debated if regional conservation efforts can alone resolve the ecological problems that global climatic changes could bring. Biological invasion is one of such concerns. In the present study, we modeled how change in global climate and regional anthropogenic pressure can impact the distribution of invasive Lantana camara in the Upper Ganga valley of the Western Himalaya (India). The forest in the study area was stratified into 1\xc2\xa0km2 grid and two 15\xc2\xa0m radius plot were located in each of the forest types in the grid, for recording Lantana presence. In total, 2221 plots were sampled covering 22% of forest. We used predictors representing the climate, forest patch size, fire and natural disaster variables for modeling the species distribution using maximum entropy algorithm. We further simulated 12 future landscape scenarios based on the global trends of these parameters. The present species\xe2\x80\x94environment relationship was projected to these future landscape scenarios. Lantana was presently estimated to spread in 231\xc2\xa0km2 of the study area. It invaded larger forest patches in the sub-tropical region, and smaller disturbed forest patches in the warm and cold temperate region. Increased distribution of Lantana was projected across all the future scenarios. The study revealed how global climate changes and regional anthropogenic pressure can have a synergistic effect on the expansion of invasive species in the future. It thus questions the efficiency of conducting only regional efforts in absence of global initiative to reduce the greenhouse gases emission.'

Title: 'Soil carbon stocks along an altitudinal gradient in different land-use categories in Lesser Himalayan foothills of Kashmir'

Abstract: 'The carbon sequestration potential of soils plays an important role in mitigating the effect of climate change, because soils serve as sinks for atmospheric carbon. The present study was conducted to estimate the carbon stocks and their variation with altitudinal gradient in the Lesser Himalayan foothills of Kashmir. The carbon stocks were estimated in different land use categories, namely: closed canopy forests, open forests, disturbed forests, and agricultural lands within the altitudinal range from 900 to 2500 m. The soil carbon content was determined by the Walkley\xe2\x80\x93Black titration method. The average soil carbon stock was found to be 2.59 kg m\xe2\x80\x932. The average soil carbon stocks in closed canopy forests, open forests, and disturbed forests were 3.39, 2.06, and 2.86 kg m\xe2\x80\x932, respectively. The average soil carbon stock in the agricultural soils was 2.03 kg m\xe2\x80\x932. The carbon stocks showed a significant decreasing trend with the altitudinal gradient with maximum values of 4.13 kg m\xe2\x80\x932 at 900\xe2\x80\x931200 m a.s.l. and minimum value of 1.55 kg m\xe2\x80\x932 at 2100\xe2\x80\x932400 m a.s.l. The agricultural soil showed the least carbon content values indicating negative impacts of soil plowing, overgrazing, and soil degradation. Lower carbon values at higher altitudes attest to the immature character of forest stands, as well as to degradation due to immense fuel wood extraction, timber extraction, and harsh climatic conditions. The study indicates that immediate attention is required for the conservation of rapidly declining carbon stocks in agricultural soils, as well as in the soils of higher altitudes.'

Title: 'Arsenic contamination in the Kanker district of central-east India: geology \nand health effects'

Abstract: 'This paper identifies newer areas of arsenic contamination in the District Kanker, which adjoins the District Rajnandgaon where high contamination has been reported earlier. A correlation with the mobile phase episodes of arsenic contamination has been identified, which further hinges on the complex geology of the area. Arsenic concentrations in both surface and groundwater, aquatic organisms (snail and water weeds) soil and vegetation of Kanker district and its adjoining area have been reported here. The region has been found to contain an elevated level of arsenic. All segments of the ecoysystem are contaminated with arsenic at varying degrees. The levels of arsenic vary constantly depending on the season and location. An analysis of groundwater from 89 locations in the Kanker district has shown high values of arsenic, iron and manganese (mean: 144, 914 and 371\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg L\xe2\x88\x921, respectively). The surface water of the region shows elevated levels of arsenic, which is influenced by the geological mineralised zonation. The most prevalent species in the groundwater is As(III), whereas the surface water of the rivers shows a significant contamination with the As(V) species. The analysis shows a bio-concentration of the toxic metals arsenic, nickel, copper and chromium. Higher arsenic concentrations (groundwater concentrations greater than 50\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg L\xe2\x88\x921) are associated with sedimentary deposits derived from volcanic rocks, hence mineral leaching appears to be the source of arsenic contamination. Higher levels of arsenic and manganese in the Kanker district have been found to cause impacts on the flora and fauna. A case study of episodic arsenical diarrhoea is presented.'

Abstract: 'A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), Dentiscutata heterogama and Rhizophagus manihotis on the growth and nutrition of Juglans venezuelensis Manning. This species is currently considered a threatened tree species and the successful restoration of its populations depends on an increased understanding of the ecological and physiological aspects of its response to inoculation with AMF. In general, shoot and total dry weight, and leaf area were significantly higher in seedlings inoculated with AMF than in non-inoculated ones. Differences in height and leaf number between the inoculated and non-inoculated treatments become apparent after 30\xc2\xa0days of plant growth. Inoculated plants had a greater leaf area as the result of the higher allocation of resources to leaf biomass (leaf mass ratio, LMR). The fraction allocated to the roots (RMR) was not significantly different between treatments. Differences between vital stain (SDH) and non-vital trypan blue stain (TB) showed that the D. heterogama colonization was almost entirely active compared to the R. manihotis colonization. The relative responsiveness (RR) of J. venezuelensis to inoculation with D. heterogama and R. manihotis was 21.8 and 25.4\xc2\xa0% respectively, but colonization values were never greater than 45\xc2\xa0%, despite low P content in the soils used. The growth and physiological responses of J. venezuelensis to inoculation with two AMF species indicate that these microorganisms should be employed when propagating this threatened species for its subsequence reintroduction into its natural habitat.'

Abstract: 'The reproductive phenology and germination behavior of 15 important tree species (Acer laevigatum, Adinandra griffithii, Citrus latipes, Elaeocarpus prunifolius, Engelhardtia spicata, Ilex embelioides, Ilex khasiana, Ilex venulosa, Illicium griffithii, Magnolia lanuginosa, Magnolia punduana, Photinia cuspidata, Photinia integrifolia, Quercus glauca and Schima khasiana) were monitored at monthly intervals for two calendar years in subtropical broad-leaved humid forests of Northeast India. These species are either endemic or threatened to the region. The investigated species showed peak flowering during the spring- while fruiting peak was observed in the autumn-season. Of the fruit types, drupes and follicles were produced by many of these species. Majority of the species adopted zoochoric mode of dispersal. The germination phenology revealed that most of the species (Acer laevigatum, Elaeocarpus prunifolius, Illicium griffithii, Magnolia lanuginosa, Magnolia punduana and Quercus glauca) undergo a period of dormancy during winter season (December\xe2\x80\x93February) and germination collides with the onset of rain indicating that moisture aids in germination. The prevailing environmental condition coupled with human disturbance seems to be of potential importance in influencing the recruitment of the selected species. Such studies would help in formulating effective strategies for conservation of these species.'

Abstract: 'The soil seed bank is a dynamic biotic component of plant communities that represents the population\xe2\x80\x99s memory in relation to selective events. Few studies have investigated the natural stock of germinable seeds in the gallery forests to evaluate their regeneration potential, although they are target of anthropogenic action. Thus, seasonal, horizontal, and vertical qualitative and quantitative variations of the seed bank of a gallery forest in the Brazilian Cerrado were studied to test the influence of the climatic seasonality, the influence of the physical structure, and depth of the soil in different microhabitats of the forest in this natural seed store. It was also compared the richness and abundance of species in the germinable seed bank with the above-ground vegetation. Three hundred and seventy-five soil samples were collected at the beginning (April 1998 and 1999) and at the end of the dry season (September 1998). These samples were collected in three microhabitats distributed transversally in relation to drainage line of a large stream, at five depths. The density of germinable seeds decreases with depth, and is similar among microhabitats and seasons. In 24,690\xc2\xa0cm3 of soil and 4.05\xc2\xa0m2 of litter, 1390 seedlings emerged, being 743 dicotyledons and 647 monocotyledons. From 761 survivors, 263 were Cyperaceae, 206 Melastomataceae, 153 Poaceae, and 82 Onagraceae, the most abundant families. This study suggests that the diversity of the germinable soil seed bank is lower than that of the above-ground vegetation of the forest, and that the soil seed bank is not the principal regeneration form of this environment.'

Abstract: 'Factors affecting in vitro propagation were evaluated for Ceropegia attenuata Hook., an endemic and endangered plant having ornamental potential but a limited reproductive capacity. Rapid shoot multiplication from nodal explants was established using varying concentrations of cytokinins and auxins either alone or in combinations. The highest frequency of shoot induction was achieved when nodal explants were inoculated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 13.31\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM 6-benzylaminopurine with a mean of 12.9\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.5 shoots per explant. High concentrations of TDZ (6.81\xe2\x80\x9311.35\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) and KN (6.78\xe2\x80\x9311.61\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) resulted in stunted and vitrified shoots. Factors implicated in the promotion of floral transition of the C. attenuata have been identified which are 4-amino-3, 5, 6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram), 6-benzylaminopurine, sucrose and photoperiod. The highest frequency of flowering (100%) was obtained when axillary shoot explants were transferred to MS medium supplemented with picloram (4.14\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) within 4\xc2\xa0weeks of culture. Transfer of in vitro regenerated shoots to half strength MS medium with 2.46\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) showed maximum root induction. The in vitro grown plantlets were successfully acclimatized in the glasshouse with 85% of survival and showed normal development. The developed protocol provided a simple, cost-effective approach for the conservation of endangered plant C. attenuata for replenishing its declining populations.'

Abstract: 'Multifaceted issues or paradigm of sustainable development should be appropriately addressed in the discipline of environmental management. Pollution of the biosphere with toxic metals has accelerated dramatically since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. In present review, comparative assessment of traditional chemical technologies and phytoremediation has been reviewed particularly in the context of cost-effectiveness. The potential of phytoremediation and green chemicals in heavy metals management has been described critically. Further, the review explores our work on phytoremediation as green technology during the last 6\xc2\xa0years and hand in hand addresses the various ecological issues, benefits and constraints pertaining to heavy metal pollution of aquatic ecosystems and its phytoremediation as first case study. Second case study demonstrates the possible health implications associated with use of metal contaminated wastewater for irrigation in peri-urban areas of developing world. Our researches revealed wetland plants/macrophytes as ideal bio-system for heavy metals removal in terms of both ecology and economy, when compared with chemical treatments. However, there are several constraints or limitations in the use of aquatic plants for phytoremediation in microcosm as well as mesocosm conditions. On the basis of our past researches, an eco-sustainable model has been proposed in order to resolve the certain constraints imposed in two case studies. In relation to future prospect, phytoremediation technology for enhanced heavy metal accumulation is still in embryonic stage and needs more attention in gene manipulation area. Moreover, harvesting and recycling tools needs more extensive research. A multidisciplinary research effort that integrates the work of natural sciences, environmental engineers and policy makers is essential for greater success of green technologies as a potent tool of heavy metals management.'

Abstract: 'A process of organogenesis via callus with successful plantlet formation was developed for Anoectochilus elatus. Indirect organogenesis was achieved from in vitro-derived node, internode, and leaf explants. The explants were cultured on Mitra medium fortified with different concentrations and combinations of plant growth regulators such as cytokinins (N6-benzyl adenine [BA], thidiazuron [TDZ], kinetin [KN], N6-(2-isopentyl) adenine [2ip] and zeatin [ZEA]), auxins (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D], \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid [NAA], indole-3-acetic acid [IAA], indole-3-butyric acid [IBA], and 4-amino-3,4,6-trichloro picolinic acid [Pic]), and additives (citric acid, trisodium citrate, peptone, coconut water, potato extract, and banana pulp). Organogenic callus proliferation was highest from internode (77.8\xc2\xa0%), followed by node (69.7\xc2\xa0%) and leaf explants (64.2\xc2\xa0%), on Mitra medium supplemented with TDZ (1.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) and NAA (0.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921). Organogenic callus derived from internodal explants produced an average of 41.8 shoots per explant, with average length of 2.5\xc2\xa0cm, on Mitra medium supplemented with BA (1.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921), NAA (0.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) and coconut water (10\xc2\xa0%). In rooting experiments, a maximum of 3.2 roots per shoot was observed with an average length of 2.1\xc2\xa0cm with 97.8% response on Mitra medium amended with AgNO3 (1.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921). The rooted plantlets were acclimatized in a mixture of garden soil, sand, vermicompost, and used tea waste (8:4:2:1 [w/w/w/w]) in a greenhouse environment, with a 72.3% survival rate. Finally, the well-developed plants were transferred to the National Orchidarium, Yercaud, Tamil Nadu, a unit of the Botanical Survey of India, Southern Regional Centre, for further maintenance and establishment under natural conditions for conservation.'

Abstract: 'Our study examined the species composition and vegetative structure of traditional homegardens within the context of the surrounding land use mosaic typical of village lands in the southwest region of Sri Lanka. We conducted interviews and spatially mapped the land uses of a single traditional village comprising over thirty households. After mapping the different land uses for each household we selected ten households and conducted a census of the vegetation of their land use areas. Land use categories included homegarden, patio, rubber, tea plantation, and secondary forest and scrub. Land holdings varied in size between 0.18 and 1.34 hectares and comprised 39% tea land, 27% homegarden, 12% patio, 17% secondary forest and scrub land, and 4% rubber plantation. We identified a total of 268 plant species on the ten properties in a total of 216 genera and 84 families across all growth habits combined (trees, shrubs, herbs and climbers). Our results show three times the plant species richness in homegardens than for any similar research on tree gardens elsewhere, but a large proportion are exotic and almost all have some kind of utilitarian purpose. The top three tree species are palms in homegardens which represent over two-thirds of the stem density and half the basal area. The conservation activities within tree gardens emphasizes the crucial\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps undervalued\xe2\x80\x94role local livelihoods and land management activities play in retaining tree species diversity comparable but dramatically differing in taxa as compared to the original rain forest.'

Abstract: 'Seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica have slow and erratic germination; thus different presowing treatments were applied to enhance the germination of its seeds collected from Tamaraikulam, Tamil Nadu, India. In addition, the effects of desiccation and different storage conditions on the germination of S. nux-vomica seeds were investigated. The results show that soaking in 500\xc2\xa0ppm gibberellic acid (GA3) for 24\xc2\xa0h, incubation of seeds at 40\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C for 3\xc2\xa0days and alternate water soaking (16\xc2\xa0h) and drying (8\xc2\xa0h) for 14\xc2\xa0days significantly increased the percentage germination compared to the control. Desiccation of seeds down to 10% moisture content resulted in better germination. Germination of S. nux-vomica seeds differed significantly between different storage periods, moisture contents of the seed and for first and second order interactions (p<0.001). The highest germination (92%) was achieved when seeds with 10% moisture content were stored at ambient temperature for 30\xc2\xa0weeks. Evidence from the present study indicates that S. nux-vomica seeds possess physiological dormancy that can be broken effectively by after-ripening. As seeds of S. nux-vomica are found to be desiccation tolerant, dry seed (10% moisture content) can be hermitically stored at ambient temperature for 30\xc2\xa0weeks without losing their viability.'

Abstract: 'In the present days, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques are comprehensive tools for the assessment of water resource, its management and conservation. In this study, remote sensing and GIS techniques are taken into consideration for zonation of different groundwater prospects of Pravara basin. Several contributing factors in which groundwater potential of an area entirely or partially depends such as lithology, geomorphology, slope, soil, lineament density, drainage density, land use and rainfall are assessed individually as well as together for making the different groundwater prospect maps through influencing factor (IF) and frequency ratio (FR) techniques. In ArcGIS software, all these thematic layers are prepared using different satellite imageries and conventional data sets, obtained from different sources. All these layers are transformed into high-resolution raster format and meshed together in GIS environment using IF and FR methods. Groundwater prospect maps are constructed as a result of overlay analysis. Based on the constructed map of groundwater prospect zones, as a result of this study, the study area is divided into five categories of different groundwater potential zones: very high, high, moderate, low and very low. Validation of the resultant maps has shown that frequency ratio technique is having higher accuracy (AUC\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8973%) compared to the influencing factors (AUC\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8969%). The present study of groundwater zonation provides a simple and less time-consuming technique; also, the results can directly be used for planning and sustainable management in Pravara basin.'

Abstract: 'A study was conducted to characterize the land use, biomass and carbon status of dry tropical forest in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, India using satellite remote sensing data and GIS techniques in the year of 2001\xe2\x80\x932002. The main forest types observed in the area are Teak forest, mixed forest, degraded forest and Sal mixed forest. The aspect and slope of the sites influenced the forest vegetation types, biomass and carbon storage in the different forests. The standing volume, above ground biomass and carbon storage varied from 35.59 to 64.31 m3\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, 45.94 to 78.31 Mg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, and 22.97 to 33.27 Mg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively among different forest types. The highest volumes, above ground biomass and carbon storage per hectare were found in the mixed forest and lowest in the degraded forest. The total standing carbon present in the entire study area was 78170.72 Mg in mixed forest, 81656.91 Mg in Teak forest, 7833.23 Mg in degraded forest and 7470.45 Mg in Sal mixed forest, respectively. The study shows that dry tropical forests of the studied area in Chhattisgarh are in growing stage and have strong potential for carbon sequestration.'

Abstract: 'Micro-interventions in rural India to create sustainable livelihoods are all aimed at generating income and wealth through new activities, preserving and accumulating natural assets like water and trees, and empowering poor people by encouraging their active participation. We studied one such intervention in the state of Gujarat and its implications for sustainability. In this project, small and marginal farmers after being introduced to new economic activities were pooled together into a larger cooperative network that in turn fed into a producers\xe2\x80\x99 company. This organisation created its own brand, used modern technology and accessed markets all over India. The idea of this experiment came from a well known NGO with experience of working in rural India. This experiment was a novel way of bringing poor farmers into the structure of a modern and reasonably large, market-driven enterprise, without creating wage labour or dispossessing people from their lands. The lessons from the experiment indicate the importance of understanding that participation and empowerment cannot be attained through a mechanical, target-driven and time bound approach. Instead, it could result in a relationship marked by dependence and passive participation.'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to characterize the land use, vegetation structure, and diversity in the Barnowpara Sanctuary, Raipur district, Chhattisgarh, India through the use of satellite remote sensing and GIS. Land cover and vegetation were spatially analyzed by digitally classifying IRS 1D LISS III satellite data using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Later, the variations in structure and diversity in different forest types and classes were quantified by adopting quadratic sampling procedures. Nine land-cover types were delineated: teak forest, dense mixed forest, degraded mixed forest, Sal mixed forest, open mixed forest, young teak plantation, grasslands, agriculture, habitation, and water bodies. The classification accuracy for different land-use classes ranged from 71.23% to 100%. The highest accuracy was observed in water bodies and grassland, followed by habitation and agriculture, teak forest, degraded mixed forest, and dense mixed forest. The accuracy was lower in open mixed forest, and sal mixed forest. Results revealed that density of different forest types varied from 324 to 733 trees ha-1, basal area from 8.13 to 28.87 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and number of species from 20 to 40. Similarly, the diversity ranged from 1.36 to 2.98, concentration of dominance from 0.06 to 0.49, species richness from 3.88 to 6.86, and beta diversity from 1.29 to 2.21. The sal mixed forest type recorded the highest basal area, diversity was highest in the dense mixed forest, and the teak forest recorded maximum density, which was poor in degraded mixed forests. The study also showed that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was strongly correlated to with the Shannon Index and species richness.'

Abstract: 'Seventeen mangrove species of eight families at seven riverine and fringe habitats in Goa West India were surveyed for Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity. Sixteen species were found to be mycorrhizal and one species showed no AM fungal colonization. AM root colonization was recorded at all seven sites and ranged from 6%\xe2\x80\x9377%. Maximum root colonization was recorded in Excoecaria agallocha (77%) and minimum colonization in Avicennia marina (6%). Paris-type colonization was predominant at all sites. Auxiliary cells were recorded in roots of Acanthus ilicifolius, Ceriops tagal and Sonneretia alba. AM fungal root colonization and spore density varied by plant species and site. Site average spore density ranged from 1.84 spores\xc2\xb7g\xe2\x88\x921 to 0.54 spores\xc2\xb7g\xe2\x88\x921 of soil. In total, 28 AM fungal species of five genera, viz. Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Gigaspora and Entrophospora, were recovered. Glomus was the dominant genus, three species of which were sporocarpic forms. Maximum site species richness (SR) ranged from 16 to 5. Species richness was maximum in A. ilicifolius where seven species of three genera were recovered. Based on relative abundance (RA) and isolation frequency (IF), two common species, viz. G. intraradices and A. laevis, were recovered from all seven sites.'

Abstract: 'Investigation of forest canopy density has become an important tool for proper management of natural resources. Vegetation cover density can identify the exact forest gaps within a particular area which in turn will provide the appropriate management strategies for future. Forest canopy density has become an essential tool for identifying the exact areas where the afforestation or reforestation programmes needs to be implemented. The aim and objective of this article is to show up the existing density of forest cover using remote sensing and geographic information system tools. Weighted overlay analysis method has been adopted for investigating forest canopy density of Sali river basin, Bankura district, West Bengal. Several indices likewise normalized difference vegetation index, bareness index, shadow index and perpendicular vegetation index etc. have been used for this study. Higher the weight was assigned for greater concentration of vegetation and lower the weight was assigned for lesser concentration of vegetation. Southern part of the region has very high density of forest coverage in comparison with the northern part of the region. It has been observed that 7.48% of the area is at very low density, 12.63% of low density, 24.84% of medium density, 23.92% of high density and 31.13% of very high forest canopy density.'

Abstract: 'The dynamics and factors responsible for morphological changes of spits viz., Uliyargoli-Padukere, Oddu Bengre and Kodi Bengre, southern Karnataka, India, are investigated using multi-dated satellite images and topographic maps during the last 95-years (1910\xe2\x80\x932005). Variations and overall rate of changes in length, area and coefficient of determination (R2) of each spit are calculated separately for two periods (1910 and 1967 as base years) to find out whether there is any significant trend in the case of change in length and area in all the three spits that are under study. Linear trend lines are fitted using a least squares method and the statistical significance is considered at 80\xc2\xa0% level of confidence. The results recorded significant changes in spit morphology, especially in length and area if 1910 and 1967 are considered separately as base years, are may be due to non-availability of data set between 1910 and 1967 period. The study reveals that coastal processes, such as SW-monsoon influenced strong currents and longshore drifts are the main process for formation and growth of spits, whereas rivers influence/drift also plays significant role. The statistical uncertainty estimation in spits morphology is prevalent wherever the coast is affected by human interventions. The study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and statistical techniques can be effectively used to understand the evolution of spits morphology.'

Abstract: 'Insect communities associated with wood decaying macro fungi inhabiting fallen trees in Rajiv Gandhi National Park (Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Karnataka) were investigated during 2005\xe2\x80\x932007. Fruiting bodies of 19 species of polypores were collected from fallen logs of different species at varied stages of deterioration. A total of 43,711 insects belonging to 91 morpho species from ten different orders were found inhabiting the fruiting bodies. Coleoptera was found to be the most abundant and species rich group. The insect emergence followed a temporal pattern. Some of the most common groups like Ciidae and Erotylidae had two or three generations per year. Ciidae was found to be the most generalist feeder, in which one unidentified species was found to breed on 11 species of fungal fruit bodies. There existed a niche partitioning among the insect communities in fresh and dried fruiting bodies. A mild positive correlation was found between the number of insect species emerged and weight of the fruiting bodies. The study elaborated the intricate relationships among wood substrates, fungal fruiting bodies and the insect faunal diversity it supports and highlighted the fact that the wood decaying fungi and thereby decomposing wood are important components of forest ecosystem, conserving valuable diversity of insects.'

Abstract: 'Most of the chemicals containing non-biodegradable metal pollutants from anthropogenic sources are highly mobile in nature. The only way to contain or limit their movement is through sorption and entrapment in the soil matrices. In this study, the sorptive response of the three most commonly found divalent metal contaminants, copper (Cu+2), lead (Pb+2), and zinc (Zn+2), are studied using two locally available semi-arid soils from Saudi Arabia. To enhance their retention capacity, these soils are amended with lime. The response to sorption at varying initial contaminant concentrations, pH conditions, temperature levels, and dilution ratios are investigated. Relying on empirical models (Langmuir and Freundlich), the nature of sorption (monolayer or heterogeneous) is ascertained. Further, kinetic models are employed to validate the type and nature of sorption that occurs (whether pseudo first-order or second-order). It is found that the experimental results correlate well with these empirical models for both the Al-Ghat and Al-Qatif soils when amended with lime and attenuate Cu, Pb, and Zn to satisfactory levels. The R 2 values are close to 1 for all the tested models. The order of sorption was Pb\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Cu\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Zn for these heavy metals, and also for soils and soil mixtures that were considered: Al-Qatif soil amended with 6\xc2\xa0% lime\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Al-Ghat soil with 6\xc2\xa0% lime\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Al-Qatif\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Al-Ghat.

Abstract: 'Plants are a valuable source of pharmacologically important compounds since these are traditionally important in medicinal systems. Medicinal plant-based ancient wisdom could serve as a powerful tool to facilitate focused research on natural compounds for the drug discovery process. Medicinal plants are more important sources for drug discovery, specifically lead molecules as these offer several advantages over the synthetic molecules. Since in post genomic era, molecular targets for most diseases are known, conventional bioscreening strategies for medicinal plants are not sufficient to fulfill the present demand. It makes the role of medicinal plants more significant than ever before. The rich heritage of Indian medicinal plants can be explored utilizing various computational approaches for bioprospecting in the post-genomic era. In this review, the authors explore how Indian medicinal plant legacy can be utilized in post-genomic era utilizing the computational, bioinformatics, chemo-informatics, genomics and systems biology approaches. This approach shall make possible the systematic analysis integrating traditional and modern data in order to validate medicinal plant based knowledge.'

Abstract: 'A jungle tribe, the Jenu-Kurubas gather the honey in the month of June. Having hit upon a hive in a hollow tree, they tie a bamboo, the short cut branches of which form a convenient ladder, to the tree during the day time and at night, provided with a basket attached to a long rope and lined with leaves, they climb up with a strongly smoking torch which they hold near the hive. The alarmed and half stunned bees fly away and their honeycombs are removed and let down in the basket. Whilst thus engaged, the Kurubas have a peculiar song, made for the occasion and expressing their feigned sympathy with the spoilated bees, so rudely disturbed of their nightly rest.

Abstract: 'Rohitukine is a chromane alkaloid possessing anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and immuno-modulatory properties. The compound was first reported from Amoora rohituka (Meliaceae) and later from Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) and Schumanniophyton problematicum (Rubiaceae). Flavopiridol, a semi-synthetic derivative of rohitukine is a potent CDK inhibitor and is currently in Phase III clinical trials. In this study, the isolation of an endophytic fungus, Fusarium proliferatum (MTCC 9690) from the inner bark tissue of Dysoxylum binectariferum Hook.f (Meliaceae) is reported. The endophytic fungus produces rohitukine when cultured in shake flasks containing potato dextrose broth. The yield of rohitukine was 186\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/100\xc2\xa0g dry mycelial weight, substantially lower than that produced by the host tissue. The compound from the fungus was authenticated by comparing the LC\xe2\x80\x93HRMS and LC\xe2\x80\x93HRMS/MS spectra with those of the reference standard and that produced by the host plant. Methanolic extract of the fungus was cytotoxic against HCT-116 and MCF-7 human cancer cell lines (IC50\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/ml for both cancer cell lines).'

Abstract: 'Before an exotic pathogen can be released as a classical biological control agent the likely positive and negative outcomes of that introduction must be predicted. Host range testing is used to assess potential damage to non-target plants. To-date 28 species of fungi have been released as classical biological control agents against weeds world-wide. These pathogens have been reported infecting only six non-target plant species outdoors and all of these incidents were predicted. Many more non-target plant species developed disease symptoms in glasshouse tests than in the field. Consequently, data from other sources are needed to ensure potential agents are not prematurely rejected. Predictions of pathogen host range to date have been sufficiently accurate to prevent unpleasant surprises. Exotic pathogens are a safe and useful tool for weed control, especially in natural areas rich in valued non-target species.'

Abstract: 'Growing population and expansion of settlements over hilly areas have largely increased the impact of landslide. This paper deals with the use of Geoinformatics technology and Fuzzy Gamma Operator model to map the landslide susceptibility zones in part of Kohima Town, Nagaland. For this study, eight landslide inducing parameters such as slope gradient, slope aspect, curvature, elevation, land use and land cover, drainage density, lineament density, and topographical wetness index were considered and prepared with the help of toposheet, high resolution satellite imagery such as World View II, LISS IV, DEM data and field data. Landslide inventory was the first step for the geospatial database generation which involves the mapping of past landslide details. Landslide susceptibility maps were generated by calculating relationship between the landslide inducing factors with past landslide locations using frequency ratio and fuzzy gamma operator model. The ratios were normalized between the range of 0 and 1 to obtain fuzzy membership values. The landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) map were prepared by integrating all the causative factors with fuzzy membership values and classified into five different susceptibility classes based on Jenks natural breaks classification viz. very high (37.51%), high (32.21%), moderate (20.97%), low (7.97%), and very low (1.34%). The LSZ map were compared with the landslide inventory map and validated with best prediction accuracy using area under curve (AUC) with the accuracy level and R-Index.'

Abstract: 'An accurate characterization of tree, understory, deadwood, floor litter, and soil organic carbon (SOC) pools in temperate forest ecosystems is important to estimate their contribution to global carbon (C) stocks. However, this information on temperate forests of the Himalayas is lacking and fragmented. In this study, we measured C stocks of tree (aboveground and belowground biomass), understory (shrubs and herbaceous), deadwood (standing and fallen trees and stumps), floor litter, and soil from 111 plots of 50\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8950\xc2\xa0m each, in seven forest types: Populus deltoides (PD), Juglans regia (JR), Cedrus deodara (CD), Pinus wallichiana (PW), mixed coniferous (MC), Abies pindrow (AP), and Betula utilis (BU) in temperate forests of Kashmir Himalaya, India. The main objective of the present study is to quantify the ecosystem C pool in these seven forest types. The results showed that the tree biomass ranged from 100.8\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in BU forest to 294.8\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 for the AP forest. The understory biomass ranged from 0.16\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in PD forest to 2.36\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in PW forest. Deadwood biomass ranged from 1.5\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in PD forest to 14.9\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 for the AP forest, whereas forest floor litter ranged from 2.5\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in BU and JR forests to 3.1\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in MC forest. The total ecosystem carbon stocks varied from 112.5 to 205.7\xc2\xa0Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 across all the forest types. The C stocks of tree, understory, deadwood, litter, and soil ranged from 45.4 to 135.6, 0.08 to 1.18, 0.7 to 6.8, 1.1 to 1.4, and 39.1\xe2\x80\x9391.4\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively, which accounted for 61.3, 0.2, 1.4, 0.8, and 36.3\xc2\xa0% of the total carbon stock. BU forest accounted 65\xc2\xa0% from soil C and 35\xc2\xa0% from biomass, whereas PD forest contributed only 26\xc2\xa0% from soil C and 74\xc2\xa0% from biomass. Of the total C stock in the 0\xe2\x80\x9330-cm soil, about 55\xc2\xa0% was stored in the upper 0\xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xa0cm. Soil C stocks in BU forest were significantly higher than those in other forests. The variability of C pools of different ecosystem components is influenced by vegetation type, stand structure, management history, and altitude. Our results reveal that a higher percentage (63\xc2\xa0%) of C is stored in biomass and less in soil in these temperate forests except at the higher elevation broad-leaved BU forest. Results from this study will enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forests in regional and global C cycles and have great implications for planning strategies for conservation. The study provides important data for developing and validating C cycling models for temperate forests.'

Abstract: 'Invasive alien organisms can impact adversely on indigenous biodiversity, while riparian invasive alien trees (IATs), through shading of the habitat, can be a key threat to stream invertebrates. We ask here whether stream fauna can recover when the key threat of riparian IATs is removed. Specifically, we address whether IAT invasion, and subsequent IAT removal, changes benthic macroinvertebrate and adult dragonfly assemblages, for the worse or for the better respectively. Natural riparian zones were controls. There were statistically significant differences between stream reaches with natural, IAT-infested and IAT-cleared riparian vegetation types, based on several metrics: immature macroinvertebrate taxon richness, average score per macroinvertebrate taxon (ASPT), a macroinvertebrate subset (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata larvae; EPTO), and adult dragonfly species richness. Reaches with natural vegetation, or cleared of IATs, supported greater relative diversity of macroinvertebrates than reaches shaded by dense IATs. Greatest macroinvertebrate ASPT and EPTO were in reaches bordered by natural vegetation and those bordered by vegetation cleared of IATs, and the lowest where the riparian corridor was IATs. Highest number of adult dragonflies species was along streams cleared of dense IATs. Overall, results showed that removal of a highly invasive, dense canopy of alien trees enables recovery of aquatic biodiversity. As benthic macroinvertebrate scores and adult dragonfly species richness are correlated and additive, their combined use is recommended for river condition assessments.'

Abstract: 'Molecular genetic fingerprints of nine Curcuma species from Northeast India were developed using PCR-based markers. The aim involves elucidating there intra- and inter-specific genetic diversity important for utilization, management, and conservation. Twelve random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), 19 Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), and four amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primers produced 266 polymorphic fragments. ISSR confirmed maximum polymorphism of 98.55% whereas RAPD and AFLP showed 93.22 and 97.27%, respectively. Marker index and polymorphic information content varied in the range of 8.64\xe2\x80\x9348.1, 19.75\xe2\x80\x9348.14, and 25\xe2\x80\x9328 and 0.17\xe2\x80\x930.48, 0.19\xe2\x80\x930.48, and 0.25\xe2\x80\x930.29 for RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP markers, respectively. The average value of number of observed alleles, number of effective alleles, mean Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity, and Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s information index were 1.93\xe2\x80\x931.98, 1.37\xe2\x80\x931.62, 0.23\xe2\x80\x930.36, and 0.38\xe2\x80\x930.50, respectively, for three DNA markers used. Dendrograms based on three molecular data using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was congruent and classified the Curcuma species into two major clusters. Cophenetic correlation coefficient between dendrogram and original similarity matrix were significant for RAPD (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.96), ISSR (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.94), and AFLP (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.97). Clustering was further supported by principle coordinate analysis. High genetic polymorphism documented is significant for conservation and further improvement of Curcuma species.'

In this research we adopted the concept of node calibration in the watershed structure unit, selected six complete watersheds on China Loess Plateau as the research areas to study the quantitative characteristics of the hierarchical structure in terms of watershed geomorphology based on digital elevation model (DEM) data, and then built a watershed hierarchical structure model that relies on gully structure feature points. We calculated the quantitative indices, such as elevation, flow accumulation and hypsometric integral and found there are remarkably closer linear correlation between flow accumulation and elevation with increasing gully order, and the same variation tendency of hypsometric integral also presented. The results showed that the characteristics of spatial structure become more stable, and the intensity of spatial aggregation gradually enhances with increasing gully order. In summary, from the view of gully node calibration, the China Loess watershed structure shows more significantly complex, and the developmental situation variation of the loess landforms also exhibited a fairly stable status with gully order increasing. So, the loess watershed structure and its changes constructed the complex system of the loess landform, and it has the great significance for studying the spatial pattern and evolution law of the watershed geomorphology.'

Abstract: 'The genus Piper is well known for their medicinal and economic potentials and is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Majority of the taxa under the genus Piper are morphologically confusing because of the wide range of variations within the vegetative characters. A total of 22 morphological characters, including both vegetative and reproductive characters were studied at a mature stage in 35 accessions of Piper taxa collected from North East India representing 12 species. The morphometric variables were analyzed using variance and Principal Component Analysis. It was carried out to identify the useful characters that can contribute to distinguish various species. The Unweighted Pair Group Method and Arithmetic Average clustering method for the vegetative traits and reproductive traits show two principal clusters. The present study revealed the importance of the morphological characters in delimitation of taxonomic grouping of the confusing species.'

Abstract: 'We studied the spatio-temporal patterns of ground-dwelling and -foraging ant assemblages in a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest on the northern periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in southeast Cameroon. The effect of season and of the interaction of season with vegetation type on ant species density, activity and composition were investigated. We also checked for a possible impact of army ant activity on the ant assemblage. Ants were collected by pitfall trapping in seven vegetation types in each of three seasons during 12 months in 2003 and 2004\xe2\x80\x932005. Season significantly influenced the ground-dwelling ant assemblage. The late wet season had the lowest ant species density and a different species composition than the early wet and the dry season. Also inter-annual variation in ant species density and composition was detected and could partly be explained by an influence of Dorylus activity. In general, vegetation type and inter-annual variation had a larger influence on the ground-ant assemblage than season. Significant effects of interactions between season, year, vegetation type and army ants on the ant assemblage confirm that also in African rainforests ant assemblages are extremely dynamic and depend on a complex combination of availability of food resources, nest sites and predators.'

Abstract: 'Satellite Remote Sensing data has been used for vegetation mapping, initial stratification, distribution of sample plots and for calculating the area under different vegetation types. Primary and secondary analyses of vegetation has been done using phytosociological ground data collected from sample piots to assess the ecological importance of different species. Interrelationships among different communities have been evaluated through various available indices. The spatial distribution and vegetation analysis indicate that commercial extraction of natural forests of Andaman has set in retrogression. The evergreen forests subjected to shorter rotation of commercial exploitation are being invaded with seral deciduous species. The study highlights the status of forests (spatial and community) and stresses the need to conserve germplasm present in the natural evergreen forests.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests are well known to have great species diversity and contribute substantial share in terrestrial carbon (C) stocks worldwide. Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 2.79 to 4.92\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to 6.76\xc2\xa0t ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was 1.59\xe2\x80\x933.53\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 while the C sequestration potential of 0.71\xe2\x80\x931.57\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.'

Abstract: 'Few studies explicitly assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of agroforestry adoption occurring beyond the project cycle. Where ex-post evaluations are published, abandonment of introduced agroforestry after project cessation is often reported. This paper presents an analysis of agroforestry adoption in a poor, peri-urban village in semi-arid south India, where 97\xc2\xa0% of initial adopters had retained their plots six to eight years after implementation. The intervention was facilitated by BAIF, an Indian non-governmental organisation specialising in natural resource management. The complex technological package promoted was known as \xe2\x80\x98wadi\xe2\x80\x99 and comprised fruit trees planted in crop fields, with a boundary of multi-purpose trees and integrated soil and water conservation measures. Sixty four agroforestry plots belonging to 43 households were surveyed in 2010/11 and interviews were held with both adopting and non-adopting farmers. Beyond retention, a quarter of adopters had expanded the practice on to additional areas of land and some diffusion to initially non-adopting farmers had also occurred. Adopters were found to have modified the practice to suit their own objectives, capabilities and constraints, highlighting that adoption is more than a simple binary choice. The study demonstrates the importance of external support for adoption of agroforestry. The intervention was not, however, especially pro-poor with adoption occurring disproportionately among relatively wealthier households with larger landholdings. Where poorer households adopted, this tended to occur later. Participation was entirely voluntary and, by 2011, conversion of suitable farmland to agroforestry had reached 18\xc2\xa0%; while beneficial to individual adopters, this patchy coverage arguably limits the potential for enhanced ecosystem service provision at landscape-scale.'

Abstract: 'Feelings and experiences of the author over Classical Taxonomy in India during the last 4 decades is discussed. Brief history and outline of development of the subject is provided. The systematic exploratory phase of taxonomy is said to have started around the middle of 16th century and with two major events, the subject reached its peak. The first one being the development of the concept of Herbarium and second one being the introduction of the Binomial System of Nomenclature by Linnaeus in 1753. Both the events laid the firm foundation for Classical Taxonomy. But during the last few decades with the development of Bio-systematic phase, although revolutionary changes in concepts of taxonomy could be noticed, the Classical Taxonomy got completely side tracked. Discussing the current status of Taxonomy in the country, the author emphasizes the dwindling nature of the subject. Among many other causes, development of more fashionable and experimental areas of modern biology, faulty methods of teaching by untrained taxonomists in most Universities, lack of sufficient taxonomic literature and herbaria, synthetic nature of discipline of taxonomy, lack of sufficient number of practicing taxonomists and field botanists to carry out the survey and documentation of the vast diversity of the flora of India, most taxonomic journals with least or no impact factor, low citation index of Classical Taxonomists, development of computer databases and computer identification devices by non-taxonomists, molecular biologists side tracking the Classical Taxonomists in areas of biodiversity assessments, avoidance of taxonomists by modern biologists in programmes of Bioprospection, apathy towards the subject by fund giving bodies and lastly, least recognitions of Classical Taxonomists by scientific bodies are cited as prominent reasons for the decline of the subject. Although Botanical Survey of India has done a commendable job in accomplishing the tasks of Taxonomists, some how the organization has failed in generating and enthusing the required number of younger taxonomists and group specialists in the country. Worse is the case with many Universities who have, to some extent killed the subject. All these factors have collectively brought about a serious decline in the subject resulting in the acute shortage of younger generation of field botanists and taxonomists who are to shoulder the big responsibilities of inventorizing the rich biodiversity in the tropics. However, the situation is not that hopeless. The achievements of Classical Taxonomists during the last 4 decades in inventorization and documentation of the flora of the country is commendable. Today the dimensions and scope of the subject have widened beyond imagination. Floristic taxonomists are sought after by many for taking part in applied aspects such as bio-prospection, new drug discoveries, search for alternate economic plant resources, conservation of biological resources and monitoring of fragile ecosystems. The author strongly feels that taxonomy with the additional objectives and broadened scope will certainly regain its past glory and become one of the challenging disciplines of biology in the 21st century.'

Abstract: 'Creeping indigo,Indigofera spicata, while only a minor source of dye, has been much planted for cover, green manure, and erosion control in coffee, tea, and rubber plantations in warm parts of the Old World. It is palatable, even enticing, to most grazing animals. Feeding tests at the University of Florida (1933\xe2\x80\x931934) demonstrated toxicity to rabbits. Pasture trials in Hawaii were promising for 10 yr, but when the plant amounted to 50% of the feed (1949\xe2\x80\x931950) it proved toxic to cattle, sheep, goats, and fowl. The deep-rooted weed, with yard-long, prostrate runners, has become naturalized from Gainesville southward and has heavily invaded many pastures in southern Florida, especially on limestone. High intake is now associated with a fatal CNS syndrome in local horses, formerly linked by some to agricultural pesticides. The leaves and seeds contain indospicine, a toxic amino acid; the toxin was formerly reported to be \xce\xb2-nitropropionic acid. Some diploid strains in Africa are said to be non-toxic.'

Abstract: 'Entomological survey was conducted to know the breeding habitat preference of the forest breeder malaria vector Anopheles baimaii, known earlier as An. dirus species D in the northeastern region of India. Breeding potential of the vector in forest areas was found to be high in water stored in jungle pool (69.84%) followed by elephant footprints with clear water (39.13%) and with turbid water (26.19%), whereas in forest fringe areas, the vector breeding was more prominent in elephant footprints: 65.11% in clear water and 62.5% in turbid water. Although other habitats had shown only low breeding of the vector, all types of habitats were positively correlated with malaria occurrence. Cattle hoof marks (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.998) and elephant footprint (turbid; r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.999) explained nearly the same amount of variance. It was observed that deforestation as well as elephant habitat-type destruction had engendered man\xe2\x80\x93elephant conflicts intensively in fringe areas. Seasonal abundance pattern of this vector was found to vary in forest and forest fringe areas in relation to different habitats. Seasonal abundance of An. baimaii was significantly different in different habitats. The Tukey post hoc comparisons indicated that the abundance of An. baimaii in different habitats was significantly higher (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) in monsoon season than that of premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. No significant difference was observed between premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. The findings therefore will eventually help to predict transmission of malaria in targeted area and in formulating an improved malaria control program in the northeastern region of India.'

Abstract: 'Fish distribution in relation to environmental variables was investigated in the Matla River of Sundarban estuarine system. A total of 64 brackish water species belonging to 38 families showing tropical and subtropical affinities were obtained upon monthly sampling of 1\xc2\xa0year. The most abundant species were Harpadon nehereus, Gudusia chapra, Coilia neglecta, Coilia ramcarati and Liza parsia. Fish assemblages showed significant seasonal variation as was revealed from MANOVA. MDS ordination plot based on similarity in the fish assemblages revealed that premonsoonal season was distinguishable from the monsoonal and postmonsoonal seasons. Notable differences were also evident between monsoon and postmonsoon. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that salinity, acidity, inorganic phosphate concentration and dissolved oxygen were the most important environmental variables in determining the observed variation in fish assemblages. Seasonal succession of fish populations may be related to differences in life cycle and adaptation to prevalent ecological conditions. The study therefore suggests that environmental variations in terms of changing salinity and dissolved oxygen have significant influence in structuring estuarine piscine community in this region.'

Abstract: 'An efficient protocol was established for regeneration of Desmodium motorium via somatic embryogenesis. Embryogenic calli were induced from cotyledon segments (6\xc2\xa0mm, 16\xc2\xa0days old) lacking embryo axis, excised from seedlings grown in\xc2\xa0vitro on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (2.9\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) in combination with 6-benzyladenine (BA) (4.44 and 8.88\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM). Differentiation of embryogenic calli into globular and heart-shaped somatic embryos was achieved on transfer to hormone-free MS medium. When incubated for 4\xc2\xa0days on MS medium supplemented with BA (8.88\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM), 95% of the globular and heart-shaped somatic embryos matured into torpedo and cotyledonary stages with minimum (10%) abnormalities. Modified MS basal medium without hormones and containing half-strength macronutrients and 0.88\xc2\xa0M sucrose was suitable for germination of mature somatic embryos. Regenerated plantlets were successfully transferred to earthen pots with survival rate of 50%. Secondary embryogenesis was observed when pre-existing somatic embryos at globular and heart-shaped stages were cultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of BA, adenine sulphate (AdS) and abscisic acid (ABA) individually.'

Abstract: 'The complete genome of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) from black pepper was sequenced and compared with CMV isolates from subgroups I and II reported worldwide. Percent identity and phylogenetic analyses clearly indicated that the CMV isolate from black pepper (BP) belongs to subgroup IB. Sequence analyses also showed the presence of a rare deletion of nine nucleotides in the putative methyltransferase domain of 1a gene which was observed only in two more isolates of CMV among one hundred 1a gene sequences of CMV for which sequence information is available in the database. Interestingly this deletion is not present in the black pepper isolate of CMV from China (WN1) and from Indian long pepper that is closely related to black pepper. Percent identity analyses showed that the 3\xe2\x80\xb2untranslated region (UTR) of the three RNAs of the BP isolate were conserved with 91% identity whereas the 5\xe2\x80\xb2UTR of three RNAs showed 52\xe2\x80\x9380% identity. The level of gene conservation among the subgroups was highest in coat protein and lowest in 2b. The values of nucleotide diversity studies were further consistent with the above data. The ratio of non-synonymous to the synonymous substitution of the five genes of three RNAs was in the order 1a\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa02a\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa02b\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa03a\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa03b and less than one for all the genes, indicating purifying selection. These clearly reflect that the protein encoded by RNA1 is highly tolerant to amino acid changes followed by that of RNA2 and, RNA3 is the least tolerant correlating to its functional importance.'

Abstract: 'Genus Chlorophytum Ker Gawl secures its position chiefly as commercial plants with a wide range of applications, right from pharmaceutical to ornamental, and with a promising economical return also. Few species of this genus are now enlisted under \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened plant category\xe2\x80\x9d due to rash harvesting from its wild habitat, as it is utilized extensively in various industries. Great challenges are associated with its conventional propagation approach. The accomplishment and rapidity in the propagation of few species of Chlorophytum have constantly been a key concern for farmers and researchers. In this regard, in vitro propagation is an efficient technique to triumph over regeneration-associated problems. Available literature was surveyed rigorously to extract the information on pharmacological utilities and recent advancements in in vitro regeneration of genus Chlorophytum. Since 1990s to till now, a number of efforts were made in different aspects of Chlorophytum under both in vitro and ex vitro conditions. Current review intends to provide a comprehensive overview of important properties and biotechnological aspects, viz. bioactive constituents and inherent properties of such as aphrodisiac potential, anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, anti-tumor and anti-oxidant, and in vitro production of genus Chlorophytum. Conclusively, proposed article is an attempt to provide overall update of various studies conducted with members of Chlorophytum genus that will possibly be helpful in proper, fullest and sustainable utilization of this important group.'

Abstract: 'The present investigation was carried out to demonstrate the plant morphogenetic potential of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in a commercially important medical plant Canscora decussata.

SNP enhanced multiple shoot formation in both nodal and leaf explants derived callus considerably in the media supplemented with 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/L NAA\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x8915\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M SNP and 0.5\xc2\xa0mg/L BAP\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x8915\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M SNP (98.32 and 96.12%) respectively. The root induction also drastically increased with the supplementation of SNP (10\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) in combination with 1.0\xc2\xa0mg/L IBA. Our results proved that SNP with other growth hormones act synergistically to enhance the in vitro responses including callus, shoot, and root induction. This optimized tissue culture system will be very useful for the mass propagation of C. decussata for both commercial and conservation aspects.'

Abstract: 'Adaptive managements on susceptible forested regions not only benefit forest recovery, but also help to improve the stability of soil-degraded area and carbon (C) sequestration. The gain of afforestation on C sink has not been addressed clearly especially in tropical and subtropical regions that will be critical in an era of global warming. Based on the Landsat satellite images, in situ forest survey and archives, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of C density and storage in a typical soil\xe2\x80\x93water conservation area in Changting county in southeastern China, dominated by the pioneer tree Pinus massoniana forest. The results showed that the C density (storage) increased significantly from 20.14\xc2\xa0Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 (0.38\xc2\xa0Tg C) in 1981 to 43.57\xc2\xa0Mg C ha\xe2\x88\x921 (1.98\xc2\xa0Tg C) in 2015 (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) and proved the success of ecological management adopted considering the interactions between local residential livelihoods and the features of local forest ecosystem. In addition, the differences of C density and storage across elevational and slope gradients also narrowed over the past 35\xc2\xa0years. The landscape also gradually shifted from lower C density to higher C density conditions based on the landscape metrics. The ecological-dominated approaches should be put in a high priority for the issue of C sequestration especially in a changing climate.'

Abstract: 'The present study was aimed to evaluate adaptive mechanism in terms of seed characters of Phyllanthus amarus collected from ten different locations of Tamil Nadu, India. The adaptive variations among the collected populations were assessed based on the sink and float percentages of the seeds in water, the percentage of seed germination, total protein, carbohydrates and their seedling\xe2\x80\x99s growth ability such as shoot and root lengths. From this, we observed that the population had a significantly higher germination percentage of sinking seeds that were attributed to its relatively higher carbohydrate and protein contents than the floating seeds. A comparison of the seed population by cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis showed that the Chennai population constituted a single clade that was very distinct from the other nine populations, which were further grouped into two sub-clusters. They exhibited a trend consistent with their geographical proximity. Standardised Mantel\xe2\x80\x99s t tests had revealed that the adaptive diversity of the P. amarus population was significantly affected by the geographic distance (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.78, t\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.68, P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.001), altitude (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.35, t\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8921.53, P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.05), minimum temperature (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.43, t\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.49, P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.01) and maximum temperature (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.49, t\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.67, P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.001). Seed\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics and geographical conditions were correlated along with 19 bioclimatic variables. In dry season, the seedling\xe2\x80\x99s rooting ability showed positive correlation, while its protein content exhibited a negative correlation. It is clearly evident from this study that the geographical variables significantly influence the adaptive ability of the P. amarus.'

Abstract: 'Coastal resources viz., coral reefs, seagrasses, mangroves, and coastal land features viz., sandy beach, mudflats and salt pan/aquaculture ponds were classified and assessed in the Palk Bay region of the south-east coast of India using IRS LISS III satellite image (1996, 2000, 2002 and 2004). The study recorded an areal coverage of 286.95 ha of reef area during 2004, which is 177.54 ha lesser than that of the reef area of 1996. The reef vegetation composed mainly of seaweeds has gained over 29.44 ha during the same period. Likewise, sand over reef area has also increased alarmingly i.e. 120.34 ha between 1996 and 2004. The seagrass beds of Munaikkadu region of the Palk Bay are comparatively protected and have gained over 7.5 ha between 1996 and 2004. It has been found that both the dense (2.99 ha) and sparse (36.45 ha) mangroves have gained their areal coverage considerably between 1996 and 2004. Whereas in Devipattinam region, many anthropogenic pressures are exerted only on the seagrass resources which has led to the reduction of over 785.5 ha of dense seagrass beds between 1996 and 2004. The study clearly indicated that the resources are under the pressures of low to high threats, especially the coral reefs and seagrasses, if the pressures continue, coastal resources of the Palk Bay may face serious threats of destruction in this part of the Bay in the years to come.'

Abstract: 'In the present study, in vitro propagation of tribal endemic medicinal plant, Andrographis lineata has been established using mature nodal explants. High frequency of regeneration (91.4%) was achieved on MS medium containing BA (3.0 mg L\xe2\x80\x931) along with IAA (0.2 mg L\xe2\x80\x931). Strikingly, irrespective of the season and collection period, we observed axillary flower induction and fruit formation from the above in vitro cultures supplemented with BA and NAA. Transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase occurred within 2 months of culture, and importantly was influenced by factors such as sucrose and cytokinins. In vitro-regenerated flowers were morphologically identical to in vivo flowers. Furthermore, our scanning electron microscopic studies revealed that pollen external morphology of both in vitro and in vivo flowers were similar. The flowers self-fertilized and produced fruits in vitro. Elongated shoots rooted well on half-strength MS basal medium, and were successfully acclimatized to the garden conditions. Altogether, our established protocol can be utilized in plant breeding for the purpose of ex situ conservation, quick flowering, and fruit set.'

Title: 'Vegetative and reproductive phenology of some multipurpose tree species in the homegardens of Barak Valley, northeast India'

Abstract: 'Traditional homegardens are an important component of the farming systems in many rural communities and have been highlighted considerably due to their sustainability and role in the conservation of biodiversity. However, the functional aspect of the homegardens, which includes the phenological behavior of the dominant tree species in such agroforestry systems, has been undermined till date, and there is a lack of adequate data on this aspect of the traditional homegardens. As a step in this direction the present study was carried out to determine the phenological behavior of important multipurpose trees in the homegardens of the village of Dargakona, Assam, northeast India. The study revealed the dominance of periodic growth deciduous species from a total of 25 tree species selected for phenological observation. The diversity of multipurpose trees in the homegardens is represented by different plant functional types with different phenological behavior which showed significant changes in their responses to inter-annual climatic variations. The diversity of tree species with different phenological behavior has implications for the temporal partitioning of resources, especially during periods of scarcity, thereby resulting in efficient utilization of resources such as water. Also the diverse phenological behavior plays an important role in regulating the food supply for the herbivore population and the year-round availability of products, and such information can be useful in the selection of species for integration into other agroforestry systems which can be sustainable in the long run.'

Abstract: 'Description of biodiversity is often cited as one of the most important actions necessary for conservation programs. There are more than 600 species of stingless bees spread over the Tropical regions of the world; though for various species, little is known about their biology and taxonomy. We sampled bees from feral colonies from various regions of India and compared them using wing morphology. The results of population analysis of the patterns of wing venation, using geometric morphometric techniques, suggested the existence of at least two phenotypic clusters within our samples of the so-called Tetragonula iridipennis complex. These findings were supported by other features, including differences in nest architecture. This helps to explain the patterns of variability found in stingless bees in India and also will be valuable for conservation planning.'

Abstract: 'The herbaceous vine, twisted birthwort Aristolochia contorta Bunge, is a rare species listed in the Red Data Book of Primorsky krai (2008). On the northern boundary of its range (south of the Russian Far East), the species is represented by small isolated populations confined to the river drainages. Using allozyme analysis, genetic variation of nine natural populations of A. contorta (247 accessions), which represented the main part of the species range in Russia, was examined. The values of genetic variation indices (P = 22.7%; A = 1.28; H o = 0.129; H e = 0.101) were low and comparable with the data obtained for other rare plants. The proportion of unique genotypes (G/N) and Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s genotypic diversity index (D) ranged from 0.32 to 0.64 and from 0.60 to 0.98, respectively. This means that A. contorta is characterized by sexual and asexual reproduction. Moreover, the ratio between these types of reproduction varied among the populations. Complete absence of inbreeding and excess of heterozygotes (F IS = \xe2\x88\x920.282), which was low probable in case of free mating, was observed. Evidently, clonal growth and (or) apomixis enables the species to maintain certain level of heterozygosity despite of small population sizes and non-regular gene exchange.'

Abstract: 'India is the world\xe2\x80\x99s tenth most forested nation with 76.87\xc2\xa0M\xc2\xa0ha of forest and tree cover occupying 23.4% of its geographical area. Forests\xe2\x80\x94with their intrinsic of carbon sequestration and storage values\xe2\x80\x94are in the front line of India\xe2\x80\x99s climate change mitigation strategies. This paper provides estimates of sequestered carbon in India\xe2\x80\x99s forest and tree cover for the years 1995 and 2005 as per the IPCC good practice guidelines method. It is based on the primary data for the soil carbon pool through collecting soil samples by laying out quadrats across the country and secondary data for the growing stock of all forest and tree cover in the country. The estimates are compared with current and future projected emissions. It is found that conservation policies have resulted in increase of the country\xe2\x80\x99s forest carbon stocks from 6244.8 to 6621.6 Mt with an annual increment of 37.7 Mt of the carbon from 1995 to 2005. Annual CO2 removal by the forests is enough to neutralise 9.3% of the country\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 level emissions. Continued removals by the forest and tree cover would offset 6.5 and 4.9% of India\xe2\x80\x99s projected annual emissions in 2010 and 2020 respectively. Economically, the annual value of this forest carbon in the international market is about US $188 million. The result is of use in the REDD and REDD+ context for India.'

Abstract: ' Exacum bicolor, an endemic and endangered medicinal plant, belongs to the family Gentianaceae. A rapid protocol has been developed for efficient multiple shoot induction by testing nodal explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with various cytokinins. The cytokinins 6-benzyladenine (BA), 6-furfurylaminopurine (Kn), 2-isopentenyladenine (2-iP) and zeatin (Zn) were used individually and in combination at different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and\xc2\xa010.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM). The maximum number of shoots (19.33\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.09 per explant) as well as their fresh weight (5.1\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.68\xc2\xa0g) and dry weight (216.83\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.84\xc2\xa0mg) were obtained with 10.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x892.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM Kn. After 4\xc2\xa0wk, the multiple shoots from agar culture were subcultured into liquid medium containing the same growth regulator combinations. After 8\xc2\xa0wk of liquid culture, the best treatment had about tenfold increase in shoot number (199.5\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.14 per explant). The fresh weight (13.76\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.14\xc2\xa0g) and dry weight (909.33\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.92\xc2\xa0mg) were highest with full strength MS medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and containing 10.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x892.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM Kn. Maximum root development was observed after 30\xc2\xa0d with 0.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) supplementation. Regenerated plants were successfully transferred to pots containing coco peat:perlite mixture and showed a 75% survival rate. Genetic fidelity of in vitro plantlets compared to mother plant were assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. All the regenerated plants were genetically identical to their mother plant, showing no detectable genetic variation in the regenerated plantlets. Thus, this protocol could be successfully used for mass multiplication and germplasm conservation of E. bicolor.'

Abstract: 'Rapid extinction of species is one of the most serious ecological problems faced by humanity today. Species are disappearing at a pace unprecedented in the history of the planet putting the very future of life at risk. The irony is that the root of the crisis is another species, Homo sapiens rather than some physical events that is poised to threaten its own survival. This article gives a brief introduction to the crisis, its consequences and possible mitigation strategies.'

Title: 'Patterns of Fine Root Mass and Distribution along a Disturbance Gradient in a Tropical Montane Forest, Central Sulawesi (Indonesia)'

Abstract: 'Large parts of the remaining tropical moist forests of South-east Asia are encroached at their margins by selective logging, rattan harvesting and the establishment of small agroforest plantations under the rainforest canopy. These slight to heavy disturbances affect aboveground forest structure by reducing wood biomass and canopy cover; however, they may also have a profound impact on the belowground compartment. In a lower montane moist forest of Central Sulawesi, we studied the profile totals of fine root biomass (FRBtot, roots <2\xc2\xa0mm until 50\xc2\xa0cm of soil depth) and of fine root necromass (FRNtot), the vertical distribution of fine root mass, and the fine root live/dead ratio by root coring in 12 forest stands that represented a gradient in forest use (or disturbance) intensity (forest use type A: undisturbed natural forest, B and C: slightly or moderately disturbed forests with selective timber extraction, D: heavily disturbed cacao agroforest systems under a remaining rainforest cover; each forest types being replicated three times). FRBtot decreased significantly from forest A to the disturbed B, C and D forests, and reached less than 60% of the FRBtot value of A in the agroforest systems D. A similar decrease with increasing disturbance intensity was found for FRNtot. Forest disturbance intensity had no significant influence on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the profiles. According to correlation and principal components analyses, fractional canopy cover was the most important factor influencing FRBtot and FRNtot, whereas diameter at breast height, stand basal area, stem density, soil pH and base saturation had only a minor or no influence on root mass. A reduction in canopy cover from 90% (forest type A) to 75% (types C and D) was associated with a reduction in FRBtot by about 45% which indicates that timber extraction leads not only to canopy gaps but to corresponding \xe2\x80\x98root gaps\xe2\x80\x99 in the soil as well. We conclude that forest encroachment that is widespread in large parts of South-east Asia\xe2\x80\x99s remaining rainforests significantly reduces tree fine root biomass and associated carbon sequestration, even if it is conducted at moderate intensities only.'

Abstract: 'Understanding the spatial patterns of species distribution is essential to characterize the structure of communities, to optimize species inventories and to evaluate the impact of biotic and abiotic variables. Here we describe the spatial structure of the distribution of leaf litter ant species, and of biotic factors that could explain it, in a subtropical semi-deciduous forest of the Argentinian Chaco, characterized by a dense understorey of shrubs and terrestrial bromeliads. Environmental variables (leaf litter quantity and ground bromeliad density) were measured and ants were collected in 1\xc2\xa0m2 quadrats distributed along two 200\xc2\xa0m transects at intervals of 1.25\xc2\xa0m. Overall 87 species were collected. Sixteen positive associations and a single negative association were observed between the 11 most frequent species taken pair-wise. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of leaf litter ants was determined at two different scales. At a small scale (period below 10\xc2\xa0m) a periodic spatial structure, likely due to intraspecific competition, produced a succession of peaks of abundance separated by gaps. At a larger scale (period around 50\xc2\xa0m), periodically distributed environmental factors induced aggregates of colonies of species responding positively to these factors. A high quantity of leaf litter and, to a lesser extent, a high density of ground bromeliads promoted a high density and a high species richness of ants. Numerically dominant ants being generally positively associated, interspecific competition was apparently weak. All ant species whose abundance was correlated with an environmental factor were not completely spatially structured by it. This suggests that some other factors, such as intraspecific competition, may have counter-effects.'

Abstract: 'The present study estimates the net emission of carbon from the forest sector in India. For the reference year (1986), the gross emission from deforestation in that year, plus committed emissions from deforestation in the preceding years, is estimated to be 64 \xc3\x97 106 t of C. The carbon sequestration (or net woody biomass accumulation in trees for long-term storage) from the area brought under tree plantations and the existing forest area under forest succession is estimated to offset the gross carbon emission in India, leading to no net emissions of carbon from the forest sector. Medium-term projections for India (for the year 2011) show that under a \xe2\x80\x98business as usual\xe2\x80\x99 scenario at current rates of afforestation, projected carbon emissions would continue to be balanced by sequestration.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we used fire count datasets derived from Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) satellite to characterize spatial patterns in fire occurrences across highly diverse geographical, vegetation and topographic gradients in the Indian region. For characterizing the spatial patterns of fire occurrences, observed fire point patterns were tested against the hypothesis of a complete spatial random (CSR) pattern using three different techniques, the quadrat analysis, nearest neighbor analysis and Ripley\xe2\x80\x99s K function. Hierarchical nearest neighboring technique was used to depict the \xe2\x80\x98hotspots\xe2\x80\x99 of fire incidents. Of the different states, highest fire counts were recorded in Madhya Pradesh (14.77%) followed by Gujarat (10.86%), Maharastra (9.92%), Mizoram (7.66%), Jharkhand (6.41%), etc. With respect to the vegetation categories, highest number of fires were recorded in agricultural regions (40.26%) followed by tropical moist deciduous vegetation (12.72), dry deciduous vegetation (11.40%), abandoned slash and burn secondary forests (9.04%), tropical montane forests (8.07%) followed by others. Analysis of fire counts based on elevation and slope range suggested that maximum number of fires occurred in low and medium elevation types and in very low to low-slope categories. Results from three different spatial techniques for spatial pattern suggested clustered pattern in fire events compared to CSR. Most importantly, results from Ripley\xe2\x80\x99s K statistic suggested that fire events are highly clustered at a lag-distance of 125 miles. Hierarchical nearest neighboring clustering technique identified significant clusters of fire \xe2\x80\x98hotspots\xe2\x80\x99 in different states in northeast and central India. The implications of these results in fire management and mitigation were discussed. Also, this study highlights the potential of spatial point pattern statistics in environmental monitoring and assessment studies with special reference to fire events in the Indian region.'

Abstract: 'This study is based on a remarkable seventeenth-century Malay court chronicle, in which the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s rulers issue injunctions on their death-beds against cultivating pepper (Piper nigrum Piperaceae) for the colonial trade. The rulers say that pepper cultivation will lead to expensive food stuffs, malice, government disorder, pretensions on the part of the subject peoples, and inevitably the destruction of the kingdom. The \xe2\x80\x9cfatal attraction\xe2\x80\x9d of pepper cultivation is likened, in an indigenous metaphor, to having a flourishing banana tree in front of one\xe2\x80\x99s gate. Analysis of historic as well as contemporary evidence from Borneo suggests that this is a remarkably astute analysis of the relations of production in pepper cultivation, especially in the transition from small-scale household cultivation to larger-scale production with state involvement. This analysis demonstrates the potential value of historic, indigenous texts for the study of economic plants, and it also shows the value of historical depth for understanding contemporary issues.'

Abstract: ' Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek, popularly known as \xe2\x80\x9cmung bean,\xe2\x80\x9d is an important protein supplement in vegetarian diets in many countries of Asia. It has a short life cycle (55\xe2\x80\x9370 days) and fits well into many cropping systems, including rice and sugarcane, under rain-fed and irrigated conditions. The present review deals with the data available on plant regeneration of this species. Both shoot-tip multiplication and somatic embryogenesis have been compared on the basis of retrospective as well as recent reports. Molecular markers, especially random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), have been used to compare results obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies on various species ofVigna. Isozyme markers such as esterase and superoxide dismutase, which are expressed during in vitro regeneration and in vivo development ofVigna species, are also included in this article.'

The sum of cation studied is 412.29\xc2\xa0\xce\xbceq\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 and that of anions is 196.98\xc2\xa0\xce\xbceq\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921, showing cation excess of 215.31\xc2\xa0\xce\xbceq\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921. The cations, namely Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and NH 4 + , made a contribution of about 67% of the total ion strength, where as anion comprising of SO 4 2\xe2\x88\x92 , Cl\xe2\x88\x92, NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92 , and HCO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  contributed 33%. The chief acidic components were Cl\xe2\x80\x93 (12%) and HCO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  (8%), while the presence of SO 4 2\xe2\x88\x92  (5%) and NO 3 \xe2\x88\x92  (6%), respectively. Percentage contribution of bole to total aboveground biomass was \xe2\x88\xbc72.38% in comparison to 2.24\xe2\x80\x932.93% of leaf biomass, 10.34\xe2\x80\x9310.96% of branch biomass and 13.21\xe2\x80\x9317.07% of bark biomass. There was high and significant variation (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) in the total aboveground biomass produced at different sites. The aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in these sites ranged between 2.09 and 9.22\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The base cations and nitrogen immobilization was found to be maximum in bole.

The critical appraisal of soil showed that cation exchange capacity lied between 18.37 and 10.30\xc2\xa0Cmol (p+) kg\xe2\x88\x921. The base saturation percentage of soil was as high as 82.43% in Senkot, whereas in Kalusidh it was just 44.28%. The local temperature corrected base cation weathering rates based on soil mineralogy, parent material class, and texture class varied from 484.15 to 627.25\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, showing a weak potentiality of the system to buffer any incoming acidity and thus providing restricted acid neutralizing capacity to keep the ecosystem stable under increased future deposition scenarios in near future. The appreciable BS of the soil indicates the presence of intense nutrient phytorecycling forces within this climate and atmospheric deposition in replenishing base cations in the soil, which includes intrinsic soil-forming processes, i.e., weathering. The highest value of critical load for acidity was 2,896.50\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 and the lowest was 2,792.45\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921. The calculated value of the minimum critical loads for nitrogen varied from 69.77 to 265.01\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921, whereas the maximum nitrogen critical load ranged between 2,992.63 and 4,394.45\xc2\xa0eq\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921.

The values of exceedance of sulfur and nitrogen were negative, implying that in the current scenario Sal forests of the Doon valley are well protected from acidification.'

Abstract: 'India\xe2\x80\x99s growing self-sufficiency in food production and food stocks since independence suggest that soils have the capacity to produce. Therefore, a review of Indian soils and their capacity to sequester carbon; and the factors favouring C sequestration under different land uses is in order. Several researchers, especially those in The National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning and the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics monitored the changes in soil organic (SOC) and inorganic (SIC) carbon as influenced by land use in the Indo-Gangetic Alluvial Plains and black soil regions between 1980 and 2005. The results showed an increase in SOC stocks due to turnover of greater plant biomass into the soil. Results of long-term fertilizer experiments with rice-based double or triple cropping systems indicate soil\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to store greater C, and maintain higher C in passive pools and that active fraction of soil C can be used as an indicator of soil health. The inclusion of active pool/labile SOC is expected to improve the performance of Century eco-system model in predicting SOC changes under different climatic conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions from the tropical Indian soils (both zeolitic and non-zeolitic) do not seem to contribute significantly to the global warming potential. The application NPK plus FYM emerged as a cost effective technology for Indian farmers. In view of the potential of C sequestration by major zeolitic and non-zeolitic soils, the present SOC stock of about 30\xc2\xa0Pg can be further increased.'

Abstract: 'We developed a method for in vitro regeneration of Garcinia xanthochymus (yellow mangosteen) from matured seed segments. Multiple shoots were induced on woody plant (WP) medium supplemented with cytokinins. An average of 11 shoots per explant were regenerated from mature seed segments on WP medium containing 20\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 6-benzylaminopurine. Histological analysis revealed that hypodermal cells of seed segments were initially involved in active division, which later developed into meristemoids, subsequently leading to the formation of shoot buds. Shoot elongation was achieved by repeated subculturing of seed explants in shoot regeneration medium. Rooting of shoots was achieved on WP medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid or \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid. Plantlets were transplanted to pots containing soil: compost (1:1) and survival rate was 90\xc2\xa0%.'

Abstract: 'Earlier studies on Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus) around Jodhpur found them entirely vegetarian (Mohnot, 1974;Winkler, 1988). However, recent observations in the open scrub forests of Jodhpur reveal that scale insects may constitute a regular part of their diet and that insectivory is particularly prevalent in the monsoon months July \xe2\x80\x93 September. The insect eating in this habitat seems to support the \xe2\x80\x9cEnergy/nutrient maximization\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis ofHamilton andBusse (1978).'

Abstract: 'Geofractures play a crucial role in environmental degradation and environmental pollution. Such geofractures were interpreted using LANDSAT and IRS 1A imagery and integrated with seismic, erosion and groundwater-chemistry data. The study shows that mostly the N-S and NE-SW trending fractures are prone to seismicity and pollutant migration while NE-SW and WNW-ESE trending faults are prone to soil erosion. The study further shows that mostly the Quaternary fractures/lineaments and the Quaternary reactivated Precambrian fractures are having a dominant control over such phenomena. On the basis of such studies, suggestions are made to take adequate care while dealing with such regions for resource exploitation and developmental purposes.'

Abstract: 'In the present study, post-mortem was conducted on a female elephant aged about 37\xc2\xa0years died at Rajeev Gandhi National Park, Hunsur, Mathigoodu Elephant Camp, Karnataka state. The animal suffered with diarrhoea, anorexia, dehydration and was unable to walk for about one week before death and was treated with antibiotics and fluid therapy for three days. The post-mortem examination revealed that, the gastric mucosa was severely congested, hyperaemic and numerous stomach bots attached to the mucosa. The bots were recovered from the gastric mucosa and processed for species identification. The posterior spiracles of the bots showed three longitudinal parallel slits in each spiracle, the abdominal segments had a row of belt like triangular shaped spines and the anterior end had two powerful oral hooks with cephalo-pharyngeal skeleton. Based on the above said morphological characters, the bots were identified as Cobboldia elephantis. This seems to be the first report of C. elephantis in free range wild elephant from Karnataka state.'

Abstract: ' Curculigo orchioides Gaertn is an important medicinal plant of commercial value. A protocol for indirect regeneration from the leaf explants was developed. The leaf explants on MS (Murashige & Skoog) basal medium fortified with 6-benzylaminopurine (9\xce\xbcM) gave rise to proliferating green callus. The calli regenerated shoots on subculturing in the MS medium with 1.1\xce\xbcM 6-benzylaminopurine which was the optimum concentration for multiplication. Rooting was observed in MS medium supplemented with \xce\xb1-napthaleneacetic acid (5.3\xce\xbcM), indole-3-butyric acid (1.2\xce\xbcM), and on MS basal medium free of plant growth regulators. The rooted plants were hardened and transferred to field with 80% survival.'

Abstract: 'A new triggering mechanism for deep convection based on the heated condensation framework (HCF) is implemented into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction climate forecast system version 2 (CFSv2). The new trigger is added as an additional criterion in the simplified Arakawa\xe2\x80\x93Schubert scheme for deep convection. Seasonal forecasts are performed to evaluate the influence of the new triggering mechanism in the representation of the Indian summer monsoon in the CFSv2. The HCF trigger improves the seasonal representation of precipitation over the Indian subcontinent. The new triggering mechanism leads to a significant, albeit relatively small, improvement in the bias of seasonal precipitation totals. In addition, the new trigger improves the representation of the seasonal precipitation cycle including the monsoon onset, and the probability distribution of precipitation intensities. The mechanism whereby the HCF improves convection over India seems to be related not only to a better representation of the background state of atmospheric convection but also to an increase in the frequency in which SAS is triggered. As a result, there was an increase in convective precipitation over India favored by the availability of moist convective instability. The increase in precipitation intensity leads to a reduction in the dry bias.'

Abstract: 'A limnological study of seventeen man-made lakes has been made. Thermal features showed absence of stable thermal stratification. Cognisable thermocline did not exist. The South-Western reservoirs with low nutrient and salt content were very poor in productivity, but the high alkaline reservoirs were also not very productive. Some reservoirs with lower alkalinity, hardness and total solids developed algal blooms and were highly productive. Bhavanisagar and Stanley reservoirs with optimal levels of dissolved salts and alkalinity-hardness were fairly productive. Reservoirs with organic soils were better in productivity than those with higher silica content (Hope Lake, Poondi Reservoir, Vaigai etc.) Dissolved oxygen depletion in the bottom was characteristic of productive waters. Total oxygen depletion occurred in some of them but in a few depletion was rare and not of great severity. Klinograde curves were characteristic of productive reservoirs. Even when the bottom waters were low in or were devoid of dissolved oxygen the outflow from this level picked up oxygen within a short distance of 100 m. Effect of water replacement on plankton production is discussed. Primary production in the reservoirs has been compared and discussed. It is the silt-laden turbid waters that are poor in production. Water releases could be manipulated to assist spawning of fishes and for amelioration of pollution downstream.'

Abstract: 'The coexistence of multifaceted geodynamical situation in the Northeastern Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal) lithosphere inspires to investigate the origin, present day orientation and gravitational stability of its basement, crust and lithospheric structures. The origin, evolution and the present day configuration of these structures such as the northward down dipping of the Bay of Bengal basement and its lithosphere, the Moho of the 85\xc2\xb0E ridge, the formation of the Ninetyeast ridge median graben and ridge normal faults and their interaction with slow convergence and stress diffusion processes in the north Andaman trench, remain conspicuous. In this paper, we explain the above mentioned processes and the existence of the Bay of Bengal basement features through plausible tectonic scenarios that related with past time dynamics of the Indian Plate prior to the India-Eurasia collision and lithospheric thermal perturbation due to the Ninetyeast Ridge magmatism.'

Abstract: 'Gene sequences mediating sexual reproduction are more divergent within and between closely related species. Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are valuable molecular tools for analysis of genetic variability, phylogeny, and also for identifying sex at seedling stage in dioecious plant species. Calamus travancoricus Bedd. ex. Becc. and Calamus nagbettai R.R.Fernald & Dey are economically important rattan species. The dioecious nature of the Calamus spp. limits its breeding and cultivation. The sex of rattans can only be identified after attaining reproductive maturity which ranges from 5 to 15\xc2\xa0years. A study was carried out in this background and 9 putative sex-specific PCR products were identified as sex markers for C. travancoricus and C. nagbettai and sequenced by Sanger method. The sequence homology search revealed occurrence of identical sequences in many plant species across different families indicating the conserved nature of the sequences. However, these sequences were not present in opposite sex in the studied species, indicating divergent evolution favoring sex determination. Annotation of these sequences revealed that most of these are mediating sexual reproduction by and large. An adequate sex ratio is to be maintained for these dioecious palms in natural habitat for producing offsprings having equal gene complements for continual evolution and sustainable utilization. Developing scientific management strategies and improved utilization of canes could help to generate employment locally and thus contribute to the socioeconomics sustainably.'

Abstract: 'The effect of nitrogen addition and weed management on fibre properties of wood from 6.5-year-old Eucalyptus grandis and E. tereticornis from intensively managed short-rotation plantations were investigated. Trees for analyses were sampled from plots with zero nitrogen input (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04), plots with high level (187\xc2\xa0kg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) nitrogen input (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04), plots from which weed growth was not removed throughout the rotation (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04) and plots from which weeds were removed periodically (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04). Fibre characteristics were evaluated on wood samples collected from base, breast height, 50, 75 and 100\xc2\xa0% of merchantable bole height of trees. Though N input and weed management improved tree growth significantly irrespective of species, the treatment effects did not cause any significant change in fibre characteristics such as fibre length, fibre diameter, lumen width and wall thickness. Longest and widest fibres were observed at the outer most radial portion of wood in all cases. In general, within tree fibre length varied significantly along the radial direction of wood. Fibre diameter, lumen width and wall thickness lacked any specific pattern between species and treatments. Runkel ratio and felting and flexibility coefficients values showed high pulping quality of wood irrespective of species and treatments. The study concluded that the fibre properties that influence pulpwood quality of Eucalyptus have not been affected by silvicultural practices, like fertilizer input and weed management, aimed at improving productivity of short-rotation eucalypt plantations.'

Abstract: 'The present investigation deals with limnobiotic status of the Almatti reservoir from February, 2003 to January, 2005. The study revealed that there exists a fluctuations of the physical factors viz., rainfall, humidity, air and water temperature, pH and electrical conductivity (EC), and chemical factors viz., dissolved oxygen (DO), free carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, bicarbonate and total dissolved solids (TDS). From the data it was also apparent that correlations between the physico-chemical factors and dynamics of phytoplankton could be seen. The simple correlation coefficient test revealed that the cyanophytes number was positively correlated with DO, nitrate, phosphate and negatively significant with total hardness, total alkalinity, EC, calcium, magnesium, sulphate, bicarbonate and TDS. They are inversely correlated with pH, chloride, rainfall and humidity. Bacillariphyceae are correlated with total alkalinity, bicarbonates, magnesium and TDS, whereas inverse correlation was found with rainfall, humidity, pH and phosphate. Desmids showed positive correlation with nitrates, while it was inversely correlated with chloride, rainfall and humidity. Dinophytes density was positively correlated with total alkalinity, EC, total hardness, calcium, bicarbonate, while it showed inverse correlation with rainfall, humidity and phosphate. However, it is obvious that the absence of significant difference between sampling stations for all these parameters in the Almatti reservoir indicated fairly homogeneous conditions and the water quality is also found to be homogeneous.'

Abstract: 'Land use and land cover (LULC) change have considerable influence on ecosystem services. Assessing change in ecosystem services due to LULC change at different spatial and temporal scales will help to identify suitable management practices for sustaining ecosystem productivity and maintaining the ecological balance. The objective of this study was to investigate variations in ecosystem services in response to LULC change over 27\xc2\xa0years in four agro-climatic zones (ACZ) of eastern India using satellite imagery for the year 1989, 1996, 2005, 2011 (Landsat TM) and 2016 (Landsat 8 OLI). The satellite images were classified into six LULC classes, agriculture land, forest, waterbody, wasteland, built-up, and mining area. During the study period (1989 to 2016), forest cover reduced by 5.2%, 13.7%, and 3.6% in Sambalpur, Keonjhar, and Kandhamal districts of Odisha, respectively. In Balasore, agricultural land reduced by 17.2% due to its conversion to built-up land. The value of ecosystem services per unit area followed the order of waterbodies > agricultural land > forests. A different set of indicators, e.g., by explicitly including diversity, could change the rank between these land uses, so the temporal trends within a land use are more important than the absolute values. Total ecosystem services increased by US$ 1296.4\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 (50.74%), US$ 1100.7\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 (98.52%), US$ 1867\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 (61.64%), and US$ 1242.6\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105 (46.13%) for Sambalpur, Balasore, Kandhamal, and Keonjhar, respectively.'

Abstract: 'It is proposed, on the basis of evidence from geological history and paleoclimatology, that annual grasses and legumes did not appear as significant components of the vegetation of Asia until the Neothermal, some 11,000 years B.P. The new combination of environmental factors which then became operative induced a widespread physiological and genetic change from a perennial to an annual habit in ecoclimatic zones in which annual types of ancestral perennials had not earlier occurred in any number. The annual prototypes of the Asian cereals and grain legumes therefore became rather suddenly and abundantly available to primitive man in his still biological ecosystems. Once this botanical revolution had occurred throughout the isoxerothermic zones around the inner cores of Asia, progress towards what came to be called civilizations, based on increasingly economic agricultural ecosystems involving cultivation and domestication of crops, followed in a gradual step-by-step manner.'

Abstract: 'This study provides an analysis of biotic change in successive mammalian communities during the last 1.8 million years of the Cretaceous (67.3\xe2\x80\x9365.58 Ma) from the Hell Creek Formation in Garfield County, Montana. Results show changes in relative abundances of species, mean individual body size, and to some extent taxonomic composition through the Hell Creek Formation. These results are interpreted as \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d mammalian responses to fluctuating temperatures during the latest Cretaceous. By contrast, the extinction of 22\xe2\x80\x9327 mammalian species at or near the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary cannot be explained by the coincident cooling interval alone. At the scale of temporal resolution available, these fossil data are inconsistent with an extended gradual pattern of extinction (linear-response) and are most consistent with either a non-linear response pattern for the K-T extinction, resulting from the accumulated stress of multiple long- and short-term environmental perturbations (e.g., climate change, sea-level regression, volcanism, an extraterrestrial impact), or a single, short-term cause (an extraterrestrial impact).'

Abstract: 'This study assesses the potential impacts of future global warming on the carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems across monsoon Asia using the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) dataset. We used simulation results of two emission pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), climate projections of five climate models, and seven terrestrial biome models to analyze the changes in net primary production and carbon stocks in the South, Southeast, and East Asian subregions during the period 1981\xe2\x80\x932099. The simulations indicated that by the end of the 21st century, net primary production would increase by 9\xe2\x80\x9345\xc2\xa0% and ecosystem carbon storage would increase by 42\xe2\x80\x9386 Pg C. The clearest climatic impacts were found when using the adaptation-oriented emission scenario (RCP8.5), which assumes a greater CO2 increase and a larger change in climatic conditions. Substantial disparities in temporal trajectories and spatial patterns were found in the estimated changes, owing to the uncertainties in the emission scenarios, climate projections, and ecosystem models. We attempted to derive consistent patterns throughout the simulations to specify potential hotspots of climatic impacts (e.g., soil carbon change in the southern Tibetan Plateau). Finally, we discuss changes to the climatic characteristics in the study region (e.g., a change in the rainy season), the implications for ecosystem services, and the need for collaborative field monitoring studies.'

Abstract: 'A potential impact of climate change in the south Asian context in general and the Indian subcontinent in particular is an increase in rainfall, in some areas up to 50%. Using an extensive information base available on the dynamics of landscape structure and function of the northeastern hill areas of India, scenarios on landscape changes, as an adaptation to climate change, have been constructed. Climate change would impose a variety of stresses on sustainable livelihood of the inhabitants of the rain-forested areas through stresses on ecosystem function. It is concluded that appropriate management strategies for natural forests and plantation forestry should go hand in hand with a comprehensive rural ecosystem rehabilitation plan.'

Abstract: 'Young leaf segments from plants growing both in vivo and in vitro were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with auxins [naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)], cytokinins [kinetin (KN) and N6-benzyladenine (BA)] and coconut liquid endosperm (CW). The explants from mature leaves did not show any growth and turned necrotic, while those obtained from juvenile leaves growing in vitro developed protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) at their cut surfaces within 4\xe2\x80\x938 wk depending on the growth medium. An optimum of 18 PLBs developed from leaf explants on medium supplemented with 2.0 mg l\xe2\x88\x921 (8.87 \xce\xbcM) BA. Upon subculture in basal MS medium, the PLBs differentiated into plantlets within 6\xe2\x80\x938 wk.

Abstract: 'This paper explores the influence over time of past policies on people\xe2\x80\x99s attitudes towards the use of forestland in Bangladesh. The discourses of the attitudes of people were captured from the observed social tradition towards forest resources. Forests were reserved systematically and solely through the Forest Department. The conservation processes were not participatory, and rights and tenure were strictly controlled. People were socially excluded and alienated from the forest, and the socio-political factors stimulated negative attitudes among people. Forests were considered to be government property, and therefore managing forests was the responsibility of the government. People only used forest resources to meet their own requirements, either with formal permission or illegally. This situation continued even after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. As a result, the forests of Bangladesh have been degraded heavily in recent decades.'

Abstract: 'Studies on phenology and reproductive biology were carried out in 15 populations of Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz (2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa022). Two different sizes of pollen grains (82.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05 and 52.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5m) with viability up to 85\xe2\x80\x9395\xc2\xa0% were observed. The receptivity of stigma was found to be 1\xc2\xa0day prior to anthesis between 08.45 and 09.15\xc2\xa0a.m. Study revealed that this species is preferentially cross pollinated and is well adopted to achieve effective pollination. Reproductive success in terms of fruit set is poor due to limitation of compatible pollens.'

Abstract: 'The objective reality of uneven water resource distribution and imbalanced water demand of the human society makes it inevitable to transfer water. It has been an age-old method to adopt the inter-basin water transfers (IBTs) for alleviating and even resolving the urgent demand of the water-deficient areas. A number of countries have made attempts and have achieved enormous benefits. However, IBTs inevitably involve the redistribution of water resources in relevant basins and may cause changes of the ecological environment in different basins. Such changes are two-sided, namely, the positive impacts, including adding new basins for water-deficient areas, facilitating water cycle, improving meteorological conditions in the recipient basins, mitigating ecological water shortage, repairing the damaged ecological system, and preserving the endangered wild fauna and flora, as well as the negative impacts, including salinization and aridification of the donor basins, damage to the ecological environment of the donor basins and the both sides of the conveying channel system, increase of water consumption in the recipient basins, and spread of diseases, etc. Because IBTs have enormous ecological risk, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the inter-basin water balance relationship, coordinate the possible conflicts and environmental quality problems between regions, and strengthen the argumentation of the ecological risk of water transfer and eco-compensation measures. In addition, there are some effective alternative measures for IBTs, such as attaching importance to water cycle, improving water use efficiency, developing sea water desalination, and rainwater harvesting technology, etc.'

Title: 'An efficient micropropagation system for Celastrus paniculatus Willd.: a vulnerable medicinal plant'

Abstract: 'A micropropagation protocol was developed for Celastrus paniculatus, a vulnerable medicinal plant. Cultures were initiated from nodal explants collected from young shoots of a 12-year-old plant in MS basal medium. An average of five shoots were produced in MS medium supplemented with 1.5\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921 benzyl adenine (BA) and 0.1\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921 naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) after two subculture cycles with a 30-day interval. Continuous subculture in the same medium for three more cycles resulted in reduction of the number of multiple shoots (2 or 3 shoots), vitrification of the shoots, and callus formation. Vitrification of cultures could be overcome by the use of MS medium supplemented with lower concentrations of BA (0.05\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921) and NAA (0.01\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x88\x921). Among the various rooting trials, ex vitro rooting of shoots with simultaneous hardening was most efficient. The method standardized in the present study is simple, as it eliminated separate steps for in vitro rooting and hardening. Qualitative chemical similarity of the tissue culture regenerants with the mother plant was confirmed using high performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) profiling.'

Abstract: 'A protocol is described for rapid multiplication of Piper barberi Gamble (Piperaceae) through shoot tip and nodal explant cultures. Nodal explants with a single axillary meristem showed three times better response with respect to shoot proliferation when compared to shoot tip explants. The best shoot proliferation response of nodal explants was observed with a cytokinin combination of N6-benzyladenine (4.43 \xce\xbcM) and kinetin (2.32 \xce\xbcM), with 88% bud break. The number of shoot initials (2.4) produced per nodal explant was twice the number of shoot initials (1.2) per shoot tip. An average of 6.9\xc2\xb10.58 adventitious shoots were observed from the proximal end of the internodal explants on Mursashige and Skoog (1962) (Ms) basal medium supplemented with N6-benzyladenine (2.22 \xce\xbcM) and kinetin (0.46 \xce\xbcM). A multiplication rate of 82 shoots per explant could be achieved after 9 wk of subculturing. The in vitro shoots were rooted on one-half and one-quarter MS basal medium. The shoots rooted on one-quarter MS in the dark produced eight roots with an average root length of 3.36 cm and 98% survival. These plants were transferred to the field with a survival rate of 75%.'

Abstract: 'Salacia chinensis L., a perennial medicinal plant, is well-known for its well-documented anti-diabetic properties. The daily growing demand in pharmaceutical industry is stimulating the conservation and wide-ranging production of the plant using plant tissue culture techniques (micropropagation). In the present study, the plants generated by direct micropropagation from nodal explants were assessed using fluorescently labeled RAPD (FRAPD) primers. Although standard RAPD primer bands in agarose gel showed genetic stability, using FRAPD analysis in genetic DNA sequencer as a novel strategy showed more accurate and reliable method has indicated by the evidence in 5% genetic variation. Antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities of micropropagated plants versus mother plant were examined using DPPH, FRAP, \xce\xb1-amylase, and \xce\xb1-glucosidase assays. The results showed that the micropropagated plants, which are able to produce higher amount of secondary metabolites than the mother plant, possess higher in vitro antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties.'

Abstract: 'The present work deals with collection, handling, utilization, and management of the waste flowers that are coming out of the temples in Coimbatore District, Tamilnadu, India. An attempt has been made to provide a current situation and complete analysis of temple waste flowers (TWFs) with suggestions and recommendations. As a part of Clean India, Clean and Green Kovai (Green Coimbatore) mission, this paper gives an idea to reduce the volume of temple waste flowers by converting into activated carbon by direct pyrolysis process and chemical activation with sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid process, respectively. The products were analyzed and compared based on the results of physicochemical parameters including pH, conductivity, moisture content, ash content, volatile content, fixed carbon, bulk density, porosity, specific gravity, water soluble matter, acid soluble matter, iodine number, methylene blue number, yield, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (SBET) surface area. The structure, surface morphology, and chemical compositions of carbon were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FeSEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. From the comparison of results, the activated carbon produced from temple waste flowers by direct pyrolysis process is fairly better due to low moisture content, low ash content, better yield, and higher surface area.'

Abstract: 'A critical first step in establishing biosphere reserves\xe2\x80\x94under the Man and Biosphere Programme of UNESCO\xe2\x80\x94is to generate baseline information for future courses of action. The present study aims to assess the structure and composition of forests\xe2\x80\x94along with anthropogenic pressures mounting on these forests in the buffer zone of one such biosphere reserves\xe2\x80\x94the Pachmarhi biosphere reserve of India. The quadrat method was employed for sampling vegetation, and information on anthropogenic pressures was collected by conducting interviews with local people and forest officials and collecting it from secondary sources. A total of 39 tree species were sampled in 82 quadrats; of these 26 tree species were in standing stage, 25 in sapling, and 35 in seedling. Chloroxylon swietenia emerged as the most dominant tree species having highest importance value index, followed by Tectona grandis, Terminalia tomentosa, and Hardwickia binata. Nine tree species and their saplings, including Sterculia urens and Terminalia arjuna, were exploited so badly that they were only found in the seedlings stage. The unavailability of standing trees of 12 important tree species including Aegle marmelos and Phyllanthus emblica indicates the intensity and gravity of anthropogenic pressures on these important tree species. If the present anthropogenic pressure continues, which has inhibited the regeneration of several tree species, then substantial negative ecological and societal consequences can be expected.'

Abstract: 'Alborz Mountains host Caspian Hyrcanian forest ecoregion along the northern slopes and forest steppe ecoregion in highlands. Hyrcanian forest covers the southeastern part of Caucasus biodiversity hotspot and is of great biogeographic importance. Altitudinal pattern and correlation between woody species biodiversity (DIV), forest structure ((stem density (DEN), mean basal area (MBA) and mean height class (MHC)) and disturbance (DIS) were explored along 2,400 m altitudinal gradient in Hyrcanian relict forest, Central Alborz Mountains. Vegetation changes from lowland forest (LoF) to midaltitude forest (MiF) and montane forest (MoF) in this area. The altitudinal gradient was divided into twelve 200 m elevational belts. Point centered quarter method (PCQM) with 96 sampling points and 83 vegetation samples by plot method (PM) were used to record field data. Shannon-Wiener index and Pearson coefficient were used for diversity and correlation analysis. The results showed that DEN decreased linearly, MBA and MHC showed relatively hump shaped and DIS showed a reverse hump shaped pattern of change along altitudinal gradient. Woody species diversity decreased non-steadily from LoF to MoF. Transitional vegetations of Carpinus-Fagus and Fagus-Quercus represented higher diversity of woody taxa compared to adjacent homogenous communities. Significant correlation was observed between altitude and all parameters: DEN with MBA, DIS and DIV; MBA with DIS; MHC with DIS along with DIV; and DIS with DIV at the study area scale. Surprisingly, correlation between studied parameters differed within each vegetation type. Altitude probably acts as a proxy for human and environmental driving forces in this area. Stability of warm and wet condition, season length, soil depth along with forest accessibility probably influences the altitudinal pattern of the studied parameters. Disturbance affects forest structure and consequently diversity; especially in lowlands. The obtained results recommend using both forest biodiversity and mensuration data in management process of forest ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'Genetic diversity of Pongamia pinnata, a plant species emerging as biodiesel source, was assessed using three endonuclease (TE)-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 275 accessions from different Indian geographical regions were collected. High level of polymorphism (62.6%) was observed in 334 loci amplified using six primer combinations. The Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s dissimilarity coefficient ranged from 0.17 to 0.80. Based on the neighbour joining method of clustering, accessions were grouped into six major clusters congruent with their respective geographical locations. The mean values of effective multiplex ratio, polymorphic information content, marker index and resolving power were 34.83, 0.286, 9.700 and 14.29 respectively. In addition, a core collection consisting of 20 accessions was identified. Population STRUCTURE analysis produced the highest log likelihood score when the number of populations (K) was set at 2, which was not consistent with clustering analysis based on genetic diversity. Two TE-AFLP markers, E_ac x P_a04 and E_ac x P_a39, were significantly associated with oil content (at P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.005). The extent of genetic diversity detected and core germplasm of CPT identified in this study could be selected and used for tree breeding, germplasm conservation and suitable feed stock for biofuel.'

Abstract: 'The genetic diversity in the wild and semi-domestic populations of Daba ecorace of Antheraea mylitta was studied to ascertain the distribution of variability within and among populations of semi-domestic bivoltine (DB), trivoltine (DT) and nature grown wild populations (DN) with inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. A total of 138 markers were produced among 56 individuals of the three populations, of which 98% were polymorphic. For the individual populations, the percentage polymorphism was 58.69, 52.9 and 77.54 for DB, DT and DN, respectively. Average number of observed (1.791\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.408) and effective alleles (1.389\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.348) was also high in the wild populations in comparison to the bivoltine and trivoltine semi-domestic populations. Genetic diversity (Ht) in DB, DT and DN was 0.180\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.033, 0.153\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.032 and 0.235\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.033, respectively and within-population genetic diversity (Hs) ranged from 0.166 to 0.259 with a mean of 0.189. Mean gene differentiation (GST) was found to be 0.25. Shanon\xe2\x80\x99s diversity index was 0.278, 0.237 and 0.361 for DB, DT and DN and overall it was 0.391. Gene flow (Nm) among the populations was 1.509. The dendrogram produced by UPGMA with Dice\xe2\x80\x99s genetic distance matrices resulted in the formation of three major clusters separating the three populations. Considerable intra- and inter-population variability is found in all three populations. The population structure analysis further suggests that the semi-domestic populations of Daba ecorace are at the threshold of differentiating themselves. The high genetic variability present within wild Daba population of A. mylitta is of much importance for conservation as well as utilization in systematic breeding program.'

Abstract: ' Human disturbance of habitat has important consequences for the demography, the morbidity, the behavior, and ultimately the survival of non-human primates. This paper is an effort to define, qualitatively, the potential influence of humans on monkey habitats and behavior in South Asia. Four variables are proposed and scored on a fourpoint scale. These variables can be used in comparisons within and between species. The four variables are description of the home range, level of harassment of the animals, habituation of the animals to humans, and the presence of predators. These measures are intentionally simple and conventional so that information may be retrieved from earlier field studies, and sites scored retrospectively. Methods for some continuous numerical measures of human influence are proposed for future studies.'

Abstract: 'The escalating loss of biological diversity throughout the world has become a major concern for the conservation biologists. Like other threatened plant species, the natural populations of the orchids are also severely threatened. Dendrobium thyrsiflorum is one such representative of the family Orchidaceae whose natural populations are getting destroyed at an alarming rate and deserves special conservation attention. Both direct shoot organogenesis (DSO) and indirect shoot organogensesis (ISO) pathways were experimented and the highest regeneration frequency for DSO and ISO pathways were found to be 86.2 and 96\xc2\xa0% respectively. The regenerated shoots were best rooted in half-strength MS medium supplemented with 1\xc2\xa0mg/l indole butyric acid (IBA) and 0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l phloroglucinol. The genetic stability of the acclimatized plants derived from ISO and DSO pathways was assessed using Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) and Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) molecular markers. SCoT proved to be a superior marker over ISSR in detecting clonal variability. The phytochemical analysis of the micropropagated plants also revealed a comprehensively higher yield of various secondary metabolites with significantly higher antioxidant potentials in both ISO- and DSO-derived plants over the mother plant. However, the ISO-derived plants were more phytochemically enriched compared to the DSO-plants. The rapid multiplication rate, higher genetic stability and secondary metabolite production ensures the utility of this micropropagation method for D. thyrsiflorum in the ex situ conservation and commercial exploitation of other important orchid species.'

Abstract: ' Zingiber zerumbet (L) Smith, a wild clonal species related to the cultivated ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), is a potential resistance donor for soft rot disease in ginger caused by Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp. In this study we evaluated the genetic diversity and P. aphanidermatum resistance of 74 Z. zerumbet accessions belonging to 15 populations from eight districts in Kerala state, India. The disease index (DI) of the accessions varied from 0% to 72.24% and the accessions could be separated into six frequency classes according to their DI values. More than 65% of the accessions had a DI\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa020%. Eight accessions were found to be immune to the infection. The relative frequency of resistant accessions was higher in the central and northern regions of Kerala. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of Z. zerumbet accessions using five primer combinations yielded 215 bands in total, of which 175 (81.4%) were polymorphic. Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic diversity (h) of 0.2738 and Shannon information index (I) of 0.4012 revealed a high genetic diversity in Z. zerumbet unexpected for a clonal species. In the UPGMA dendrogram, accessions were clustered mostly according to their geographical origin and no clear correspondence was observed between the clustering pattern of accessions and their responses to Pythium aphanidermatum. The study revealed high genetic diversity and variability for pathogen resistance among Z. zerumbet accessions and confirmed the value of Z. zerumbet as a potential donor for soft rot resistance for the genetic improvement of ginger.'

Abstract: 'Analysis of the mean wind, equivalent potential temperature and virtual potential temperature profiles observed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Electra aircraft and obtained from dropwindsondes and ship-launched radiosondes were made in conjunction with synoptic observations to study the structure of the monsoon boundary layer over the Arabian Sea during MONEX 79. Comparison of mean profiles indicates the monsoon boundary layer to be much different from the trade wind boundary layer. Results confirm the existence of a boundary-layer jet known as East African or Somali Jet. Regions of multiple cloud layers at roughly the height of the capping inversion layer were associated with the jet. Regions in which a more well-mixed layer was observed showed a jet structure depressed in height. A free-jet surface-layer model appears to describe the mean wind structure of this jet observed during the present study and by others. An approximate balance of forces was found in the monsoon boundary layer between friction, advective acceleration, Coriolis and pressure gradient forces. Friction and advective acceleration terms were significant in the lower levels of the boundary layer. Forces in a typical trade wind boundary layer were found to be approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those observed in the monsoon boundary layer.'

Abstract: 'A population of the S. Indian cyprinid fishBarbus melanampyx was sampled monthly through 24 months. Seasonal cycles of the gonado-somatic index (GSI), ovarian stages, male breeding tubercles, spawning behaviour and population structure were assessed. These fish breed strictly seasonally during the main dry period: December/January through April. Comparison with other Barbus species of the same general region led to the conclusion that the patterns of reproductive investment ofB. melanampyx are similar to those of perennial species, and different from those of wet-season spawners. The reasons for this rather unexpected result were found in the more constant conditions prevailing during a dry season as compared to the monsoon. It was argued thatB. melanampyx and the species spawning perennially are in effect \xe2\x80\x98small-brood\xe2\x80\x99 spawners, rather than partial spawners.'

Abstract: 'Although Si is recognized as a beneficial element for crops, the determination of plant-available silicon (PAS) in soils has become challenging. A correlation between pH and PAS indicators has been reported in the literature due to the higher degree of weathering of acidic soil. We tested this hypothesis in the cultivated rice fields of Karnataka State, India, which exhibit gradients of pH and climate.'

Abstract: 'Comparative studies of sympatric species are essential in understanding those species\xe2\x80\x99 behavioral and ecological adaptations as well as the mechanisms that can reduce resource competition enough to allow coexistence. We collected data on diet, activity budget and habitat use from two sympatric macaque species, the Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) and the rhesus macaque (M. mulatta), in a limestone seasonal rainforest of Nonggang Nature Reserve, southwestern Guangxi, China. Our results show that the two sympatric macaques differ in diet, activity budget, and habitat use: (1) out of the 131 plant species that were used by both macaque species as food over the year, only 15 plant species (11\xc2\xa0%) were shared. Rhesus macaques used more plant species as major foods, and had higher dietary diversity and evenness indexes than Assamese macaques. (2) Assamese macaques fed predominantly on leaves, whereas rhesus macaques fed more selectively on fruits. The rhesus macaques\xe2\x80\x99 diet varied according to season, and was significantly correlated to season fluctuation in fruit availability. (3) Assamese macaques devoted more time to resting, and less time to feeding than rhesus macaques (4) Assamese macaques were present mostly on the cliff, and tended to stay on the ground, whereas rhesus macaques were present mostly on the hillside, and showed preference to lower and middle canopy. The observed differences in diet and habitat use between the two macaque species represent behavioral patterns enabling their coexistence.'

Abstract: 'Estimating animal distributions and abundances over large regions is of primary interest in ecology and conservation. Specifically, integrating data from reliable but expensive surveys conducted at smaller scales with cost-effective but less reliable data generated from surveys at wider scales remains a central challenge in statistical ecology. In this study, we use a Bayesian smoothing technique based on a conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution and Bayesian regression to address this problem. We illustrate the utility of our proposed methodology by integrating (i) abundance estimates of tigers in wildlife reserves from intensive photographic capture\xe2\x80\x93recapture methods, and (ii) estimates of tiger habitat occupancy from indirect sign surveys, conducted over a wider region. We also investigate whether the random effects which represent the spatial association due to the CAR structure have any confounding effect on the fixed effects of the regression coefficients.'

Abstract: 'Consumption of greens is a major source of vitamins and micro-nutrients for people using only vegetarian diets rich in carbohydrates. In remote rural settlements where vegetable cultivation is not practiced and market supplies are not organized, local inhabitants depend on indigenous vegetables, both cultivated in kitchen gardens and wild, for enriching the diversity of food. Knowledge of such foods is part of traditional knowledge which is largely transmitted through participation of individuals of households. A total of 123 households in six villages of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve buffer zone was surveyed using a schedule to assess the knowledge, availability and consumption pattern of wild leafy vegetables. Quantity estimations were done using regular visits with informants from 30 sample households of the six study villages during the collections. Monetization was used to see the value of wild leafy vegetables harvested during a year. The diversity of wild leafy vegetables being use by the local inhabitants is 21 species belonging to 14 genera and 11 families. This is far less than that being reported to be used by the communities from Western Ghats in India and some parts of Africa. Irrespective of social or economic status all households in the study villages had the knowledge and used wild leafy vegetables. The number of households reported to consume these wild leafy vegetables is greater than the number of households reporting to harvest them for all species except for Diplazium esculentum and Phytolacca acinosa. The availability and use period varied for the species are listed by the users. The study indicated that the knowledge is eroding due to changing social values and non participation of younger generation in collection and processing of such wild leafy vegetables.'

Abstract: 'The Balasore coastal groundwater basin in Orissa, India is under a serious threat of overdraft and seawater intrusion. The overexploitation resulted in abandoning many shallow tubewells in the basin. The main intent of this study is the development of a 2-D groundwater flow and transport model of the basin using the Visual MODFLOW package for analyzing the aquifer response to various pumping strategies. The simulation model was calibrated and validated satisfactorily. Using the validated model, the groundwater response to five pumping scenarios under existing cropping conditions was simulated. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the Balasore aquifer system is more susceptible to the river seepage, recharge from rainfall and interflow than the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities and specific storage. Finally, based on the modeling results, salient management strategies are suggested for the long-term sustainability of vital groundwater resources of the Balasore groundwater basin. The most promising management strategy for the Balasore basin could be: a reduction in the pumpage from the second aquifer by 50% in the downstream region and an increase in the pumpage to 150% from the first and second aquifer at potential locations.'

Abstract: 'The size class distribution in tree populations will continue to be used for analysing the regeneration of tree species and successional patterns in forest communities at extensive levels. However, information regarding the approximate estimates of lifetime expectancy (residence time) for each of the size classes, viz seedlings, saplings and trees, and the estimates of rate of net gain for them (population divided by residence time) can considerably enhance our understanding of the regeneration trends of species. It is shown that several population structures, based on size class distribution may indicate declining population trend, although the population, as indicated by rate of net gain parameter, in fact may foretell future expansion or stability. It appears that high species richness and high percentages of species with poor regeneration are interrelated with each other.'

Abstract: 'In persuasion of global commitment of the country on reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission, India\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98National Mission on Sustainable Habitat\xe2\x80\x99 has included promotion of energy efficiency in residential and commercial sector and has envisaged that energy use in buildings varies significantly across income groups, building construction typology, climate and several other factors. Though substantial energy savings can be achieved in the housing sector through implementation of various carbon mitigation options, it was stated that the incremental cost of implementing energy efficient measures is estimated to vary between 3 and 5% for residential houses. The challenge before the engineers, architects and other professionals associated with building construction sector is to find out appropriate technologies that will ensure reduction of GHG emission without increasing cost of construction. As majority of construction in government sector will come from construction of small residential house belonging to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as part of government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to provide housing for all by 2020, assessment of GHG reduction potential of various cost-effective construction technologies is very essential to provide guidance to the stakeholders. This paper has surveyed various prevalent construction technologies in different parts of the country, analyzed the cost and embodied GHG emission for construction of the building envelope by collecting data through extensive search of literature and information obtained from construction sites. It has been found that there is ample scope of adoption of location-specific, cost-effective and eco-friendly construction technologies for construction of houses for EWS which are capable of reduction of GHG emission without any increase in cost of construction. The technologies can meet the commitment of the country at international level on reduction of GHG emission without any extra burden to state exchequer.'

Abstract: 'The present paper deals with the distribution of sediment and sediment-bound nutrients in two important coastal lagoons of southern Kerala such as the Ashtamudi Estuarine Lagoon in the Kollam district and the Kadinamkulam Lagoon in the Thiruvananthapuram district. Among the two lagoons, the former is coast perpendicular, and the latter is coast parallel. An analysis of the textural characteristics reveals that, in both lagoons, the estuarine mouth and areas close to it are dominated by sand and sand-rich sediment species, indicating a high-energy depositional regime prevailing the region. On the other hand, the silt and clay dominant arms are almost sheltered and enjoy a low-energy depositional environment. The nutrient and organic carbon contents in the sheltered areas are significantly higher than the most dynamic high-energy estuarine mouth regions. This peculiar behaviour of these coastal water bodies has to be given adequate importance while laying down strategies for the conservation and management of these fragile aquatic systems in the south-western coast of India in particular and tropical coasts of the world in general.'

Abstract: 'Avifaunal study was carried out in Panipat refinery area before and after commissioning. A total of 63 birds were observed during the study, of which 39 and 49 birds were present during 1992 and 2001 respectively. Of these, 25 birds were common during both the study period. Blue rock pigeon was most dominant during 1992 whereas house sparrow was dominant during 2001. Species diversity index was found to be 5.26 and 6.64 in respective years. Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s and Sorenson similarity indices were 0.40 and 0.57 respectively. Majority of birds were insectivorous in habits followed by granivorous birds in 1992 and piscivorous birds in 2001. The study reveals that less diversity was observed in 1992 when Panipat refinery was commissioned, but more birds especially aquatic ones were observed after the commissioning of the refinery. This has been attributed to increase in birds habitats due to developments of wetlands in and outside refinery, development of green belt around refinery and increase in green cover of area due to boosting of agroforestry and social forestry.'

Abstract: 'Water balance of a basin involves estimation of input precipitation, runoff, infiltration and evapotranspiration (ET). Although ET may have large variations over a big basin, it is commonly estimated using a few point measurements and this makes the estimation error prone. Satellite based remote sensing data provides few parameters for estimation of energy fluxes, at the land surface and atmosphere interaction in a distributed manner using the meteorological parameters. These parameters through surface energy balance equation have been used for the estimation of ET in this study. Various spatially distributed variables required for ET estimation; viz. NDVI, surface albedo, surface temperature etc. have been derived using remote sensing and ancillary data for Tapi basin located in western India. Beside this field data such as rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours etc. have been used. For computation of runoff, Soil Conservation Services (SCS) approach has been considered. Tapi basin up to Ukai dam has been selected as the study area. Satellite data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite, which carries the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), have been used for preparation of various maps required for runoff and ET analysis. The results of runoff and ET have been compared with observed data for 2\xc2\xa0years, 2002\xe2\x80\x932003 and the results have been found in good agreement with observed data.'

Abstract: 'Wular Lake is the largest freshwater lake of India located in north western Himalayas of Kashmir Valley which has got deteriorated over the period of time due to the enough human interference within its catchment areas. The purpose of the present research study is to identify the changes in land use and land cover in the Wular catchment as well as its transformation into other classes and its impact on the overall water quality of the lake. For the present study Landsat (TM) image of 1992 and Landsat-8 (OLI) of 2015 have been used for assessing the changes in land use/land cover. Supervised classification technique was used to generate LULC maps of different categories pertaining to study area for years 1992 and 2015. Regarding water quality, water samples were collected from five different spots of the lake in four different seasons of the year\xe2\x80\x94from December 2014 to September 2015. The sites from which samples were collected are Vintage Park, Ashtungo, Watlab, Makhdomyari and Ningal as site 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Some parameters of water like temperature, transparency, depth, conductivity and pH were examined on the spot during the sample collection by their respective measuring instruments. The rest of the parameters were examined in hydrological laboratory within 24\xc2\xa0h after collection following the standard methods of APHA (Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 21st edn. American Public Health Association, Washington, DC, 2005). The relationship between the LULC classes and water quality parameters has been calculated with the help of SHDI which has shown both positive and as well as negative results.'

Abstract: 'Two of the key factors that drive agricultural growth and food production in India are access to arable land and utilizable water resources. These are examined with particular reference to their regional variation in order to make an assessment of the magnitude of the food security challenge they pose for the country. Recent official estimates of groundwater exploitation in India are compared with actual negative physical, social and economic consequences of over-exploitation, as are evident in different regions, and their implications for national food security discussed. The analyses show that the real food security and water management challenge lies in the mismatch between water availability and agricultural water demand: high demands occur in water scarce but agriculturally prosperous regions and low demands in naturally water-abundant but agriculturally backward regions. Serious groundwater depletion problems, which occur in the naturally water-scarce but surplus food-producing regions, magnify the challenge. The small area of arable land per capita is a major reason for low agricultural water demand in regions that have abundant water. Sustainability of well irrigation in the naturally water-scarce regions, which is the backbone of India\xe2\x80\x99s food security, could be achieved through judicious investment in surface water projects which encourage direct irrigation and replenishment of over-exploited aquifers. Other strategies include: pro rata pricing of electricity in the farm sector; volumetric pricing of water from public irrigation systems; improving the efficiency of utilization of green water or the rainwater held in the soil profile; preventing depletion of the residual soil moisture in the field after crop harvest by reducing the fallow period; and reducing the use of water through a shift to low water consuming crops'

Abstract: 'Palaeoclimate and Palaeoecological study was carried out in \xe2\x88\xbc2 m sediment core deposited since 4 ka in an estuarine environment along Uppanar River mouth, Cauvery Delta. Palynological and thecamoebian evidences indicate (1) a basal fluvial lacustrine depositional environment (\xe2\x88\xbc4\xe2\x80\x933 ka) characterized by sandy sediment, with low salinity and dominance of non-pollen forms like foraminiferal linings and thecamoebians with a low percentage of pollen and spores and (2) an estuarine environment (since 3 ka) characterized by clayey sediment with high salinity and a good percentage of mangrove and terrestrial pollen along with non-pollen forms. A shift in the depositional environment since \xe2\x88\xbc3 ka indicates monsoonal and geomorphological changes in the coastal wetland. During this period dominance of Avicennia and Cheno/Ams indicate low freshwater runoff from land suggesting a weakened monsoon condition enhanced by anthropogenic activity.'

Abstract: 'We investigated decomposition and nutrient release patterns of leaf and sheath litter of two important highland bamboo species (viz. Phyllostachys bambusoides Sieb. (Zucc.) and Arundinaria racemosa Munro) by using a litter bag technique. Our objective was to improve understanding of the addition of organic matter and nutrients to soil from the litter of two abundant highland bamboo species, species that support the local population of the region in many ways. N concentration and N/P ratio were significantly higher (p<0.01) in leaf litter of P. bambusoides. Significantly, larger values of lignin concentration, C/N ratio, and lignin/N ratio were found in the sheath litter of A racemosa. Weight loss of both leaf and sheath litter was strongly positively correlated with N and N/P ratio, and significantly negatively correlated (p<0.01) with C/N ratio. Lignin/N had a negative correlation with decay rate. In both species, only lignin concentration of the litter showed strong positive correlation with N release. Litter decomposition and N release patterns were similar for the two bamboo species, whereas, P release rate from leaf litter was higher in P. bambusoides and differed significantly between sheath and leaf litter for both species. The complex pattern of nutrient release through mineralization and immobilization during litter decomposition ensures nutrient availability in both managed and natural bamboo stands subjected to anthropogenic disturbances.'

Abstract: 'The paper presents the nature of annual cycles of tropospheric ozone, cloud occurrences, NO2, rainfall, SO2, SPM, CO, non-methane hydrocarbon and surface solar radiation for the period October 2004 to June 2009 over Alipore (22.52\xc2\xb0N, 88.33\xc2\xb0E), India. Annual cycle of low-level cloud occurrences depicts that the low-level cloud over Alipore had been noticed to occur for many days and nights, particularly from June to September. The low-level cloud occurrences were found in winter months and post-monsoon period. The effect of cloud occurrences on tropospheric ozone concentration has been critically analysed and explained. It has been observed that the concentration of ozone is oscillatory with cloud occurrences and has a slight linear decreasing trend with the increase of cloud occurrences and vice versa. The concentration of tropospheric ozone attained higher value at moderate cloud occurrences and comparatively lower value at both of the lower and higher cloud occurrences. The related possible chemical and physical explanation for role of cloud occurrences on tropospheric ozone has been offered.'

Abstract: 'Three frog species (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis, Limnodynastes fletcheri and Litoria  raniformis) were surveyed in rice bays of the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA), NSW, Australia, during the rice-growing seasons of 2005/2006 and 2006/2007. A total external morphological abnormality index of 7.0% was observed in frogs of the CIA (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891,209). The types and frequencies of abnormalities were typical of reports from agricultural areas with ectrodactyly being the most common aberration. A relatively low abnormality index of 1.2% was observed in L. raniformis (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8987) compared to indices of 7.1% and 8.2% observed in L. fletcheri (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89694) and L. tasmaniensis (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89428), respectively. No conclusive evidence was found of unnaturally high rates of intersex, gonadal maldevelopment or unbalanced sex ratios in any species. Rice bay  surface waters differed significantly in mean pesticide concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor on farms growing rice and corn compared to farms with rice as the sole crop. However, the similar abnormality indices observed in recent metamorphs emerging from these two farm types provided no evidence to suggest a link between larval exposure to the measured pesticides and developmental malformations.'

Abstract: 'A study was conducted to investigate the response of Jatropha curcas L., an important bio-diesel plant species, to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) inoculations. AM species, isolated from its rhizosphere could colonize its roots/rhizospheres, indicating that J. curcas does not retard the activities of AM fungi. However, the seedlings did not respond positively to the inoculations and mycorrhizal dependency (MD) for some inoculants was in the negative range. This could be due to the large amount of nutrients stored in cotyledons of big sized J. curcas seeds. Further results showed that the removal of cotyledons (metabolic reserves) immediately after seed germination did not increase MD of J. curcas. Workers from different countries have reported variable results on this aspect and it is generally admitted that different populations, varieties, cultivars or strains of any specific cultivated crop may react differently to different situations such as inoculation with AM fungi. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to test the different populations of J. curcas from various locations under a given set of conditions.'

Abstract: 'This paper tries to understand the soil erosion characteristics in a tropical plateau fringe region by the use of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Soil loss estimation is an important phenomenon to understand the land degradation. An integrated method needs to be adopted in tropical plateau fringe region to estimate the soil loss. RUSLE has been adopted for the present study. The river in the basin under consideration sees its origin from a plateau top region and flows through the plateau fringe region of eastern Chotanagpur plateau, India. The present study area reflects undulated plateau fringe landform with gently sloping dissected plateau topography. The different factors like, rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topographic factor (LS), crop and management factor (C), and support and practice factor (P) have been enumerated using field and remote sensing data. Each factors result has also been verified with previous literature. All factors have been multiplied in GIS environment to estimate soil loss. High-magnitude soil loss region (>\xe2\x80\x8910\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) covers 4.88% of the total area and extends up to the upper reaches of the watershed. Topographic and soil factors best represent this loss. Low-magnitude soil loss region (<\xe2\x80\x892.5\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921) in the lower reaches of the watershed is a result of successful land management activity. Soil erosion is dominated process of land degradation in the upper reaches of the watershed and estimation of soil loss is an important input for land-use land-cover management. The study also inferred that RUSLE soil erosion model could be effectively used in tropical plateau fringe environment.'

Abstract: 'The southwestern coast of India is drained by many small rivers with lengths less than 250\xc2\xa0km and catchment areas less than 6,500\xc2\xa0km2. These rivers are perennial and are also the major drinking water sources in the region. But, the fast pace of urbanization, industrialization, fertilizer intensive agricultural activities and rise in pilgrim tourism in the past four to five decades have imposed marked changes in water quality and solute fluxes of many of these rivers. The problems have aggravated further due to leaching of ionic constituents from the organic-rich (peaty) impervious sub-surface layers that are exposed due to channel incision resulting from indiscriminate instream mining for construction-grade sand and gravel. In this context, an attempt has been made here to evaluate the water quality and the net nutrient flux of one of the important rivers in the southwestern coast of India, the Manimala river which has a length of about 90\xc2\xa0km and catchment area of 847\xc2\xa0km2. The river exhibits seasonal variation in most of the water quality parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, HCO3, NO2-N, NO3-N, P\\(_{\\rm \\text{-}inorg}\\), P\\(_{\\rm \\text{-}tot}\\), chloride, SO4, and SiO2). Except for NO3-N and SiO2, all the other parameters are generally enriched in non-monsoon (December\xe2\x80\x93May) samples than that of monsoon (June\xe2\x80\x93November). The flux estimation reveals that the Manimala river transports an amount of 2,308\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x891 of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 87\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x891 dissolved inorganic phosphorus, and 9246\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x891 of SO4, and 1984\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x891 K into the receiving coastal waters. These together constitute about 23% of the total dissolved fluxes transported by the Manimala river. Based on the study, a set of mitigation measures are also suggested to improve the overall water quality of small catchment rivers of the densely populated tropics in general and the south western coast in particular.'

Abstract: 'Eight accessions of swordbean (Canavalia gladiata (Jacq.) DC.) were collected from eight agroclimatic regions of Tamil Nadu, India. A portion of the collected seeds of accessions will be deposited in NBPGR, New Delhi. The most pronounced differences in agrobotanical characters were observed in seed germination percentage, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of leaves (180th day) per plant, leaf area (150th day), early flowering, fertility index and 100-seed-weight. Differences in the contents of crude protein and crude lipid in the seeds of different accessions also appeared to be significant. Performance of Lowerkodiyar and Mundanthurai accessions under test conditions was superior and suggested that breeders might exploit the genome of these accessions in current pulse crop improvement programmes.'

Abstract: 'Teak (Tectona grandis L. f.; family Verbanaceae) is an important plantation tree species in the tropics and in India one of the first species to be prioritized for improvement. Improvement efforts for the last 50 years have essentially concentrated on augmenting quality seed production by establishing seed production areas (SPA) and clonal seed orchards (CSO). Presently, these two form the main sources of quality planting material for teak throughout the country. However, there is no information on the genetic quality of such sources nor information on the progeny used in plantation programmes. Reports of studies based on coniferous and tropical species provide conflicting results on the impact of domestication on the genetic diversity of populations (Chaisurisri and El Kassaby, 1994; Rajora, 1999; Moran et\xc2\xa0al., 2000; Godt et\xc2\xa0al., 2001; Icgen et\xc2\xa0al., 2006). Also the impact of domestication on the genetic diversity of progeny populations is poorly understood (Stoehr and...'

Elongated shoots were separated and rooted on MS medium supplemented with 9.8\xce\xbcM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and various phenolic compounds within 5\xe2\x80\x936 wk. Phloroglucinol and salicylic acid interaction with IBA stimulated in vitro rooting of shoots. Successful field transfer was achieved in rooted plantlets.'

Abstract: 'Shoot tip and single node explants from young shoots of 1-year old flowering plants of Rauwolfia micrantha Hook. f. were cultured on Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium variously supplemented with 6-benzyladenine (BA) and \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). A combination of 13.2 \xce\xbcM BA and 2.68 \xce\xbcM NAA induced high frequency (77%) formation of up to 3 shoots from each node in 8 weeks. The regeneration of shoot tips from the field-grown plants and in vitro shoots placed horizontally differed. Repeated subculturing of the shoot tips and single nodes at 6-week intervals for over a year in combination of 4.4 \xce\xbcM BA and 0.27 \xce\xbcM NAA enabled mass multiplication of shoots without any evidence of decline. Rooting of the excised shoots on medium containing 2.6 \xce\xbcM NAA was preceded by callus formation. The rooted plants were removed off the callus, hardened off and 80% established in pots. Micropropagated plants displayed uniform morphological, growth, flowering, fruiting and seed germination characteristics.'

Abstract: 'Wildlife poisoning is an important conservation threat for endangered species in India. There are no publications in the scientific literature that identify the specific poisons or chemicals involved in wildlife poisoning cases from the state of Kerala. In this report, all cases of wildlife mortality recorded between 2011 and 2013 at the office of the Assistant Forest Veterinary Officer, Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala were reviewed and cases where poisoning was considered as a differential diagnosis were identified. Specific poisons or chemicals were identified in three cases, while in a fourth, poisoning was determined to have occurred based on physical traces of the poison in gut contents. The poisons identified include carbofuran (a carbamate pesticide) in a bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata), warfarin (a rodenticide) in a mortality event involving four wild boars (Sus scrofa), endosulfan (an organochlorine pesticide) toxicity in a gaur (Bos gaurus) and imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid pesticide) toxicity in a wild adult Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). This communication thus reports for the first time on the specific chemical compounds identified in wildlife poisoning cases from Kerala state and argues for greater regulation of the sale and use of such toxic compounds in India.'

Abstract: 'Chintamani Abhayaranya in South 24-Parganas, West Bengal has an exposure to anthropogenic stress for its location. Soil mites here, constituted more than 73% of the population of soil microarthropods. Oribatid mites were found to be the most numerically abundant group among the soil mites, followed by order Mesostigmata. Population maxima and minima of the mite community were recorded during September and May respectively. Soil moisture and organic carbon content of the soil showed strong positive correlation with the abundance of mite population. One-way ANOVA revealed significant difference between the seasonal abundances of mite population. Group diversity of mite population was highest during July and lowest during January. No significant correlation, as per rank correlation analysis was noticed between the group diversity and edaphic factors. Regression analysis showed that only a small fraction variabilty of group diversity could be explained separately by four edaphic factors considered.'

Abstract: 'We compared morphological and genetic attributes of progeny obtained from three seed production areas (SPAs) and three corresponding unimproved stands (UIS) of teak (Tectona grandis L.f) at three broad teak growing regions in the state of Karnataka, India. In general, seed morphological parameters such as seed weight, seed size and seed emptiness were significantly superior in SPAs compared to UISs. Seed germination percentage was also higher in seeds from SPAs. Seedling performance measured at two monthly intervals for six months was observed to be superior in SPAs at two of the three regions compared. Although the genetic diversity of progeny of SPAs was lower than UIS at all regions, the values were moderately high. Germination percent was positively correlated with fruit weight and kernel weight per seed, while diversity indices were negatively correlated with fruit weight, fruit diameter and kernel weight per seed. SPAs proved important as a source of moderately improved planting material with no severe threat to the genetic diversity of future plantations.'

Abstract: 'The Naaf River estuary is one of the large estuaries in the Bangladesh coastal region not to have been affected by extensive human disturbance. This research provides information about the fisheries diversity status by Estuarine Set Bag Net (ESBN) sampling relation to physicochemical variables in both spatio-temporal scales. About 25\xc2\xa0km of the lower estuary was divided into six zones for sample collection by considering the accessibility and availability of the ESBN operation, fish landing centers and location of the fishing villages. In total 48 samples have been analyzed which were taken throughout March to October 2006. To quantify the species diversity, all fisheries data were analyzed by using EstimateS and EcoSim software which accounts the different diversity indices viz., species richness, Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener diversity Index, Dominance and Evenness index. The research results demonstrate that the Naaf River estuary is a habitat of 161 (species richness, Sobs\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89161, Choa 1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89162\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.34, ACE\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89161.73) different species which belong to 98 fin fishes, 23 shrimps and prawns, 13 crabs, 11 molluscs, 3 echinoderms, 4 other crustaceans; while 9 remain unidentified. Results on the aquatic environment, mainly salinity and turbidity were found to have a major influence on their occurrence and distribution. All the findings indicated that the Naaf River estuary is a highly productive system and provides a favourable environment for large variety of estuarine species assemblages.'

Abstract: 'This paper investigates how changes in neighborhood facilities\xe2\x80\x94new schools, health posts, bus services, mills, dairies, agricultural cooperatives, and other facilities\xe2\x80\x94influence perceptions of environmental degradation. We use three types of data from a rural area in Nepal: (1) data on changing neighborhood facilities from 171 neighborhoods, collected using ethnographic, survey, and archival methods; (2) survey data on household characteristics and environmental perceptions from 1,651 households; and (3) individual-level survey data. We find that new neighborhood facilities are associated with perceptions of environmental degradation. This is important because perceptions may indicate objective environmental degradation, encourage participation in programs to improve the environmental, and influence environmental behavior.'

Abstract: 'Fine root turnover (<2 mm) was determined from repeated measurements of root distribution up to 120 cm soil depth by core sampling in four month intervals. Sole cropped Sorghum bicolor and Acacia saligna were compared with the agroforestry combination in an alley cropping system in semiarid Northern Kenya. Three methods for the calculation of root production were used: the max-min, balancing-transfer and compartment-flow method. The highest root biomass was found in the topsoil for all cropping systems, though trees had a deeper root system. Trees and crops had a similar amount of below-ground biomass during the vegetation period (0.3 and 0.4 Mg DM ha-1 120 cm-1), but in the agroforestry combination root biomass was more than the sum of the sole cropped systems (1.1 Mg DM ha-1 120 cm-1). The tree system showed a very static root development with little fluctuation between seasons, whereas root biomasses were very dynamic in the crop and tree + crop systems. Root production was highest in the tree + crop combination with 2.1 Mg DM ha-1 a-1, with about 50% less in sole cropped trees and crops. Root N input to soil decreased in the order tree + crop>tree>crop system with 13.5, 11.0 and 3.2 kg N ha-1 a-1, and cannot be estimated from total below-ground biomass or carbon turnover, as N is accumulated in senescing roots. Such low N input to soil stresses the need for investigating other processes of nutrient input from roots to soil. Areas of highest N input were identified in the topsoil under the tree row in the tree system. Resource utilisation and C and N input to soil were highest with a combination of annual and perennial crops.'

Abstract: 'Forest plays a vital role in regulating climate through carbon sequestration in its biomass. Biomass reflects the health and environmental conditions of a forest ecosystem. In context to the climate change mitigation mechanisms like REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), an extensive forest monitoring campaign is especially important. Remote sensing of forest structure and biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bears significant potential for mapping and understanding forest ecological processes. Limitations of the conventional forest inventory procedures, like the extensive cost, labor and time, can be overcome through integrated geospatial techniques. Optical sensor or SAR data are suitable for extracting information about simple and homogeneous forest stand sites. However, optical sensors face serious limitations, specifically in tropical regions, like the cloud cover that SAR can overcome along with targeting saturation and penetration aspects. Simultaneous use of spectral information and image texture parameters improves the biomass assessment over undulating terrain and in radical conditions. Also, synergic use of multi-sensor optical and SAR has better potential than single sensor. Interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) SAR or a combination of the both (PolInSAR) serves as effective alternatives. These techniques could serve as valuable methods for biomass assessment of heterogeneous complex biophysical environments. However, SAR data have its own limitations and complexities. Identifying, understanding and solving major uncertainties in different stages of the biomass estimation procedure are critical. In this regard, the current study provides a review of radar remote sensing-based studies in forest biomass estimation.'

Abstract: 'Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is known for its nutritional, medicinal, and ornamental importance. It is conventionally propagated by hardwood and softwood cuttings, but about 1\xc2\xa0yr is needed before the rooted cuttings can be transplanted to the field. Propagation by seed is undesirable as populations are heterozygous and seed propagation leads to wide variations in tree and fruit characteristics. Several studies have been conducted on in vitro culture of pomegranate, and protocols have been developed for plant regeneration through organogenesis and embryogenesis from various types of explants. Tissue culture has enabled mass propagation of superior genotypes of both wild and cultivated varieties. However, successful application of tissue culture systems for genetic engineering of pomegranate is still limited. Molecular markers are essential for identification and discrimination of genotypes for genetic conservation, crop improvement, breeding programs, and commercialization of superior genotypes. These techniques may also be applicable to rapid identification and indexing of disease-free planting material. This review focuses on the biotechnological approaches that are being used for pomegranate improvement.'

Title: 'Study of cloudburst and flash floods around Leh, India, during August 4\xe2\x80\x936, 2010'

Abstract: 'Leh and surrounding region of the Ladakh mountain range in the trans-Himalaya experienced multiple cloudbursts and associated flash floods during August 4\xe2\x80\x936, 2010. However, 12.8\xc2\xa0mm/day rainfall recorded at the nearest meteorological station at Leh did not corroborate with the flood severity. For better understanding of this event, hydrological analysis and atmospheric modeling are carried out in tandem. Two small catchments (<3\xc2\xa0km2) were studied along the stream continuum to assess the flood characteristics to identify the cloudburst impact zones. Peak flood discharges were estimated close to the head wall region and at the catchment outlet of the Leh town and the Sabu eastern tributary catchments. Storm runoff depth is estimated by developing a triangular hydrograph by using the known time base of the flood hydrograph. This triangular hydrographs have been transformed further into storm hydrographs to gain a better understanding of the storm duration by using the dimensionless hydrograph method at selected cross sections. Storm duration is estimated by using the relationship between time to peak and time of concentration of the catchment. The peak flood estimates ranged from 122(\xc2\xb135\xc2\xa0%) m3/s for Leh town catchment (2.393\xc2\xa0km2), 545(\xc2\xb135\xc2\xa0%) m3/s for Sabu eastern tributary catchment (2.831\xc2\xa0km2) to 1,070(\xc2\xb135\xc2\xa0%) m3/sec for Sabu catchment (64.95\xc2\xa0km2). To assess the atmospheric processes associated with this event, a triple nest simulation (27, 9 and 3\xc2\xa0km) is performed using Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling system. The simulation does show the evolution of the event from August 4 to 6, 2010. Observation constraints, orographic responses, etc. make such analysis complex at such scale. Independent estimate by the atmospheric process model and the hydrological method shows the storm depth of 70\xc2\xa0mm and 91.8(\xc2\xb135\xc2\xa0%)\xc2\xa0mm, respectively, in catchment scale. Hydrological evaluation further refined the spatial and temporal extents of the cloudbursts in the respective catchments with an estimated storm depth of 209(\xc2\xb135\xc2\xa0%)\xc2\xa0mm in 11.9\xc2\xa0min and 320(\xc2\xb135\xc2\xa0%) in 8.8\xc2\xa0min occurring in an area of 0.842\xe2\x80\x931.601\xc2\xa0km2, respectively. This study shows that the insight developed on the cloudburst phenomena by the atmospheric and the hydrological modeling is hugely constrained by the spatial and temporal scales of data used for the analysis. Apart from this, study also highlighted the regular occurrence of cloudburst events over this region in the recent past. Most of such events go unreported due to lack of monitoring mechanisms in the region and weaken our ability to understand these events in complete perspective.'

Abstract: 'A Gram-negative, non-motile, catalase-positive and oxidase-positive, aerobic bacterium designated as NII-0918T was isolated from soil sample in Western ghat forest, India. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain NII-0918T belongs to the subclass \xce\xb1-Proteobacteria, being related to the genus Paracoccus, and sharing highest sequence similarity with Paracoccus chinensis NBRC 104937T (99.4%), Paracoccus marinus NBRC 100640T (97.3%), Paracoccus koreensis Ch05T (97.1%) and Paracoccus kondratievae GBT (97.0%). Other members of Paracoccus showed below 97.0% similarity. The DNA\xe2\x80\x93DNA hybridization values between these four strains and NII-0918T were 44.7, 28, 32 and 41%, respectively. The major fatty acids of strain NII-0918T were summed feature 7 (C18:1 \xcf\x897c/\xcf\x89 9t/\xcf\x89 12t) (83.0%) and C18:0 (12.5%). Ubiquinone Q-10 was detected as the major respiratory quinone. The G+C content of genomic DNA of NII-0918T was 66.6\xc2\xa0mol%. On the basis of physiological, morphological, chemotaxonomical and DNA\xe2\x80\x93DNA hybridization data, it is proposed that strain NII-0918T should be placed as a novel species, for which we propose Paracoccus niistensis sp. nov.

Abstract: 'Safe structures are the backbone of human coping capacity towards healthy living that can contribute significantly in reducing risk during hazards. However, due to various natural and anthropogenic activities, about 12.6% of land areas (excluding snow-covered area) in India are prone to landslide posing threat to life and property. Moreover, many structures in the hilly terrain of India are non-engineered which results in high vulnerability of buildings. Therefore, assessment of physical vulnerability is a fundamental step in reducing landslide risk. The study aims to present a methodology to assess vulnerability of the buildings using indicator-based approach at site-specific scale. Several studies to assess vulnerability of buildings due to landslides have been carried out by researchers from European countries. But these methodologies cannot be implemented successfully in India because of different geological and climatic condition. The different components of the discussed methodology for physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to landslides such as landslide intensity (a function of landslide velocity and volume) and resistance of buildings (a function of structural and non-structural features) are worked out and suggested by different researchers. However, putting them together, to present as a framework (specifically in Indian scenario) is the novelty of the present work. Further, consideration of the concept of \xe2\x80\x98proximity of buildings to landslides\xe2\x80\x99 in the process of site-specific vulnerability assessment is newly proposed. To address this issue, fifteen potential indicators contributing to vulnerability of buildings have been identified and a systematic form for documentation of data during field survey has also been prepared (keeping in view the construction bye-laws and techniques followed in India). The methodology discussed is further successfully implemented in ward number 10 of Gopeshwar Township (Chamoli District), Uttarakhand, India.'

Abstract: 'Improving quality of life (QoL) is one of the main goals of many public policies. A useful tool to measure QoL needs to get a good balance between indicators guided by theories (top-down approach) and indicators defined by local people (bottom-up approach). However, QoL measurement tools often neglect to include elements that define the standard of living at local level. In this paper, we analyse the correspondence between human development index, as an indicator adopted by governments to assess QoL, and the elements defined by local people as important in their QoL, called here local means. Using a free-listing technique, we collected information from 114 individuals from Kodagu, Kartanataka (India), to capture local means defining QoL. We then compared local means with the indicators used by Human development report (HDR) of Karnataka, the main measurement tool of QoL in Kodagu. The list of local means included access to basic facilities and many issues related to agriculture and natural resources management as elements locally defining QoL. We also found that HDR does not capture the means defined by people as indicators of QoL. Our findings suggest an important gap between current QoL\xe2\x80\x99s indicators considered by public policies and the means of QoL defined by people. Our study provides insights for a set of plausible local indicators useful to achieve a balance between top-down and bottom-up approaches for the local public policies.'

Abstract: 'Evaluation of litterfall production is important for understanding nutrient cycling, forest growth, successional pathways, and interactions with environmental variables in forest ecosystems. Litterfall was intensively studied during the period of 1982\xe2\x80\x932001 in two subtropical monsoon vegetation gradients in the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. The two gradients include: (1) a successional gradient composed of pine forest (PF), mixed pine and broadleaved forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (BF), and (2) an altitudinal gradient composed of Baiyunci ravine rain forest (BRF), Qingyunci ravine rain forest (QRF), BF and mountainous evergreen broadleaved forest (MMF). Mean annual litterfall production was 356, 861 and 849\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 for PF, MF and BF of the successional gradient, and 1016, 1061, 849 and 489\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 for BRF, QRF, BF and MMF of the altitudinal gradient, respectively. As expected, mean annual litterfall of the pioneer forest PF was the lowest, but rapidly increased over the observation period while those in other forests were relatively stable, confirming that forest litterfall production is closely related to successional stages and growth patterns. Leaf proportions of total litterfall in PF, MF, BF, BRF, QRF and MMF were 76.4%, 68.4%, 56.8%, 55.7%, 57.6% and 69.2%, respectively, which were consistent with the results from studies in other evergreen broadleaved forests. Our analysis on litterfall monthly distributions indicated that litterfall production was much higher during the period of April to September compared to other months for all studied forest types. Although there were significant impacts of some climate variables (maximum and effective temperatures) on litterfall production in some of the studied forests, the mechanisms of how climate factors (temperature and rainfall) interactively affect litterfall await further study.'

Abstract: 'Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of leaf and root tissues of Nothapodytes nimmoniana unravels several putative pathway genes, transcription factors and CYPs related to camptothecin (CPT) biosynthesis. Additionally, post-transcriptional suppression by artificial microRNA (aMIR) of NnCYP76B6 (geraniol 10-hydroxylase) suggests its role in CPT biosynthesis. Tissue-specific LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of secologanin as the central intermediate of MIA pathway in N. nimmoniana.'

Abstract: 'With Ernst Assmann\xe2\x80\x99s appointment to the chair of Forest Yield Science in Munich in 1951, he assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the extensive network of growth-and-yield plots of the Bavarian Forest Research Institute. This network, with some plots having been remeasured since 1870, proved to be a rich source of observations, and constituted the empirical basis for Assmann\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental theories in production ecology. Realizing the strategic value of long-term field observations, scientists are using (a) designed experiments and (b) observational studies to study forest structure and dynamics. This contribution is an attempt to clarify fundamental differences, and to present examples, of these two approaches. We present recent developments regarding the installation of Designed Experiments and show that rigorous experimental design, usually found in planted forests and based on very specific manipulations, that are normally not found in the natural environment is required to address a particular hypothesis that cannot be tested by merely using available observations. We also present examples of new Forest Observational Networks established in China, India, Africa and America. These alternative research infrastructures are especially suitable for the study of natural forests that exhibit a high diversity of tree species with varying size and age structures. Our conclusion is that Forest Observational Studies are emerging as an important alternative to Designed Experiments because they provide a vast amount of information about complex natural forest communities rather quickly. However, long-term commitment is essential to ensure a steady flow of observations about forest dynamics. Manipulated experiments and observational studies can be complementary, but the optimum use of both installations requires careful planning and coordination.'

Abstract: ' Asparagus racemosus Willd. is an important medicinal plant of tropical and subtropical India. Its medicinal usage has been reported in the Indian and British Pharmacopoeias and in traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha. The multiple uses of this species have increased its commercial demand, resulting in over-exploitation. Because of destructive harvesting, the natural population of A. racemosus is rapidly disappearing, and it is recognized as \xe2\x80\x98vulnerable\xe2\x80\x99 (Warner et al., Some important medicinal plants of the Western Ghats, India: a profile. International Development Research Centre, Artstock, New Delhi, India, 15 pp, 2001). The development of an efficient micropropagation protocol will play a significant role in meeting the requirements for commercial cultivation, thereby conserving the species in its natural habitat. In the present study, in vitro shoot proliferation was obtained by culturing single node segments in Murashige and Skoog\xe2\x80\x99s (MS) medium supplemented with 3.69\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 2-isopentyl adenine and 3% sucrose with a multiplication rate of 3.5. For proper root formation, the in vitro-formed shoot clusters were cultured on half strength (major salts reduced to half) MS medium with 1.61\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M 1-naphthalene acetic acid, 0.46\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M kinetin, 98.91\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M adenine sulfate, 500\xc2\xa0mg/l malt extract, 198.25\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M phloroglucinol, and 3% sucrose. On this medium, 85% rooting was observed within 20\xc2\xa0d. Following a simple hardening procedure involving sequential transfer of plants to a greenhouse, polyhouse, and shade net, the tissue-cultured plants were transferred to the field where the survival rate was 100%.'

Abstract: 'Genetic and genotypic variabilities of a rare relict aquatic plant Nelumbo komarovii Grossh. from six natural populations of Primorsky krai (Russia) were assessed using isozyme analysis. The highest genetic and genotypic diversities were observed in the Razdol\xe2\x80\x99noe and Okeanskaya populations, which can be explained by cross-pollination participation in the seed formation for maintenance of the Razdol\xe2\x80\x99noe population size and by sowing seeds from different habitats for the Okeanskaya population. Low polymorphism at the population level (P = 8.97, HO = 0.055, HE = 0.039) is determined by the history of existence of the species from the Tertiary Period as well as by the influence of gene drift. Clonal renewal plays a decisive role in the propagation of N. komarovii in most natural populations.'

Abstract: 'Soil erosion by water is ubiquitous, exhibits spatio-temporal variability, and is fundamental to determining sediment yield which is key to proper watershed management. In this study, we propose a relationship between the curve number and sediment yield index (SYI) using cubic splines. Using field data from four watersheds, the relation between observed and computed SYI is found to have a coefficient of determination (R2) value from 0.63 to 0.88 suggesting that such a relation can be used to determine SYI from the available CN value. It is found that cubic splines perform satisfactorily with Nash-Sutcliff efficiency ranging from 60.18 to 64.01%, absolute prediction error from 1.35 to 5.56%, integral square error from 1.21 to 5.82%, coefficient of correlation from 79.32 to 93.78%, and degree of agreement from 0.87 to 0.99%.'

Abstract: 'With the continuous increase in the population of developing countries and decline of natural resources, there is an urgent need to qualitatively and quantitatively augment crop productivity by using new tools and technologies for improvement of agriculturally important traits. The new scientific and technological omics-based approaches have enabled us to deal with several issues and challenges faced by modern agricultural system and provided us novel opportunities for ensuring food and nutritional security. Recent developments in sequencing techniques have made available huge amount of genomic and transcriptomic data on model and cultivated crop plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum etc. The sequencing data along with other data generated through several omics platforms have significantly influenced the disciplines of crop sciences. Gene discovery and expression profiling-based technologies are offering enormous opportunities to the scientific community which can now apply marker-assisted selection technology to assess and enhance diversity in their collected germplasm, introgress essential traits from new sources and investigate genes that control key traits of crop plants. Utilization of omics science and technologies for crop productivity, protection and management has recently been receiving a lot of attention; the majority of the efforts have been put into signifying the possible applications of various omics technologies in crop plant sciences. This article highlights the background of challenges and opportunities for augmentation of crop productivity through interventions of omics technologies in India.'

Abstract: 'Groundwater recharge is an important process for the management of both surface and subsurface water resources. The present study utilizes the application of analytical hierarchical process (AHP) on geospatial analysis for the exploration of potential zones for artificial groundwater recharge along Vaigai upper basin in the Theni district, Tamil Nadu, India. The morphology of earth surface features such as geology, geomorphology, soil types, land use and land cover, drainage, lineament, and aquifers influence the groundwater recharge in either direct or indirect way. These thematic layers are extracted from Landsat ETM+ image, topographical map, and other collateral data sources. In this study, the multilayers were weighed accordingly to the magnitude of groundwater recharge potential. The AHP technique is a pair-wise matrix analytical method was used to calculate the geometric mean and normalized weight of individual parameters. Further, the normalized weighted layers are mathematically overlaid for preparation of groundwater recharge potential zone map. The results revealed that 21.8\xc2\xa0km2 of the total area are identified as high potential for groundwater recharge. The gentle slope areas in middle-east and central part have been moderately potential for groundwater recharge. Hilly terrains in south are considered as unsuitable zone for groundwater recharge processes.'

Abstract: 'North east India is considered as one of the major biodiversity hotspots worldwide and centre of origin of several plant species including Musa. Musa acuminata Colla is known to be one of the wild progenitors of cultivated bananas and plantains. Three single primer based DNA marker techniques viz., random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and directed amplification of minisatellites DNA (DAMD) were used for diversity diagnostics among 25 genotypes of wild M. acuminata collected from Meghalaya province of north east India. A total of 58 primers (26-RAPD, 21-ISSR, and11-DAMD) yielded 451 DNA fragments, of which 395 (87.58\xc2\xa0%) were found to be polymorphic in nature. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values were almost identical for each marker system. The resolving power of the marker system was found to be highest in RAPD (3.96) whereas ISSR resolved highest marker index (16.39) in the study. Selected amplicon data obtained through single primer amplification reactions were utilized for determination of diversity within and among the populations of M. acuminata. Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic differentiation (Gst) value (0.451) indicated higher proportion of the genetic variation within the populations which is supported by the AMOVA analysis (88\xc2\xa0%). The study provides insight into the efficacy of RAPD, ISSR and DAMD to analyse the genetic variation existing in the wild Musa germplasm, which can further\xc2\xa0be exploited for quality trait improvement and domestication of such important horticultural crops. The genetic diversity based population structure may shed light on the genetic basis of speciation and evolution of various species within the genus Musa.'

Abstract: 'Insect visitors documented on cashew flowers during the present investigation include 40 species belonging to 13 families of three insect orders. The Hymenopterans were the major floral visitors comprising of bees, ants and wasps followed by dipterans. Among the 40 species recorded as flower visitors, only 13 are considered as pollinators of cashew, in which eight belong to Apidae and five belong to Halictidae. Among the two bee families, Apidae was the most abundant contributing 75.6% of the bee abundance. Within Apidae, the highest species abundance was recorded for Braunsapis picitarsus (20%) followed by Apis cerana indica (16.7%). Halictidae bees contributed to 24.4% of bee abundance, among which Pseudapis oxybeloides was most abundant (17.6%). Peak bee activity was recorded between 11.00 and 13.00\xc2\xa0h for most of the bees. During 10.00\xe2\x80\x9313.00\xc2\xa0h, B. picitarsus was the most abundant (22\xe2\x80\x9331%) followed by P. oxybeloides (18\xe2\x80\x9325%), A. c. indica (12\xe2\x80\x9315%), Ceratina sp. (8\xe2\x80\x9313%) and A. florea (6\xe2\x80\x9314%). Foraging rate was more for A. c. indica followed by B. picitarsus and A. florea. Lesser time was spent by A. c. indica for nectar and P. oxybeloides for pollen (i.e. 1\xe2\x80\x934\xc2\xa0s), while longer time of 3\xe2\x80\x9321, 8\xe2\x80\x9316 and 5\xe2\x80\x9311\xc2\xa0s was spent by A. florea, B. picitarsus and Tetragonula sp., respectively. Bees of C. hieroglyphica, Lasioglossum sp. and Seledonia sp. spent 2\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xa0s per flower. Foraging rate was higher in A. c. indica and B. picitarsus, while foraging speed was lesser in A. c. indica and P. oxybeloides. Nesting sites of different bee species and the common bee flora in the study area were also recorded.'

Abstract: "The circumscription and phylogenetic position of the tribe Durioneae (Bombacaceae or /Malvaceae/Helicteroideae) was investigated by supplementing a previously publishedndhF data set. The present analysis supports a narrow conception of Durioneae (excludingCamptostemon andPapuodendron) and confirms a close relationship withHelicteres, Reevesia, Ungeria, andTriplochiton (all of traditional Sterculiaceae). Phylogenetic relationships within Durioneae were inferred from a combined analysis ofndhF and ITS sequences. These data suggest thatNeesia is sister to a clade comprising all other five genera of core Durioneae, and thatCoelostegia +Kostermansia form a clade that is sister toCullenia +Boschia +Durio. Various morphological features support these relationships. However, characters usually considered diagnostic for the entirety of Durioneae, such as a densely lepidote lower leaf surface and uni- or polylocular anthers, appear to be apomorphic within this clade. Likewise, spiny fruits and large arils covering the seeds are not plesiomorphic for Durioneae, in contradiction to Corner's classic Durian Theory. The phylogeny suggests that bat- and bird-pollination evolved from beetle-pollination and that this transition was coincident with extensive androecial modification. Similarities due to convergent evolution of floral traits in relation to pollination by birds and mammals probably account for the erroneous, traditional placement of Durioneae in Bombacaceae."

Abstract: 'The present study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of meteorological drought in the Parambikulam-Aliyar basin, Tamil Nadu using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as an indicator of drought severity. The basin was divided into 97 grid-cells of 5\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0km with each grid correspondence to approximately 1.03\xc2\xa0% of total area. Monthly rainfall data for the period of 40\xc2\xa0years (1972\xe2\x80\x932011) from 28 rain gauge stations in the basin was spatially interpolated and gridded monthly rainfall was created. Regional representative of SPI values calculated from mean areal rainfall were used to analyse the temporal variation of drought at multiple time scales. Spatial variation of drought was analysed based on highest drought severity derived from the monthly gridded SPI values. Frequency analyse was applied to assess the recurrence pattern of drought severity. The temporal analysis of SPI indicated that moderate, severe and extreme droughts are common in the basin and spatial analysis of drought severity identified the areas most frequently affected by drought. The results of this study can be used for developing drought preparedness plan and formulating mitigation strategies for sustainable water resource management within the basin.'

Abstract: 'This paper reflects on the impacts of agrarian change and social reorganisation on gender-nature relations through the lens of an indigenous group named the Kuruma in South India. Building upon recent work of feminist political ecology, I uncover a number of dualisms attached to the gender-nature nexus and put forward that gender roles are constituted by social relations which need to be analysed with regard to the transformative potential of gender-nature relations. Three main themes are at the centre of the empirical inquiry: gender subjectivities, rural off-farm employment and the human-nature nexus. I seek to show that, first, the production of gendered subjectivities cannot be simplified through essentialist assumptions that romanticise women\xe2\x80\x99s relationships with nature; second, off-farm employment strategies both reinforce the social hierarchy in gender and contradict the Kuruma\xe2\x80\x99s moral economies; and, finally, environmental and agrarian change redefine the use of agrobiodiversity and are related to ideas on progressive versus nonprogressive cultivation practices. The research is informed by qualitative research methods and offers a conceptual approach to the deconstruction of gender-nature relations from a poststructuralist feminist perspective.'

Abstract: 'The island of Madagascar ranks second to the neotropics in diversity of Bignoniaceae. Tribe Coleeae (Bignoniaceae) is a monophyletic group of tropical trees endemic to Madagascar and surrounding islands. The Masoala assemblage of Coleeae, in northeastern Madagascar, utilizes four mechanisms for avoiding competition via niche specialization: (1) morphologically via characters that comprise syndromes, explaining part of the pattern in this system \xe2\x80\x93 although the syndrome concept is not perfect; (2) spatially via vertical stratification and potentially pollen placement; (3) temporally via phenological stagger; (4) ethologically via flowering duration and display. The 13 sympatric species of understory treelets and canopy trees did receive low flower visitor numbers. Contrary to the prevailing view of pollination systems where generalized systems predict equivalency between floral traits and pollinators, I found that different pollinators pollinated the 13 species of trees, that floral characters of different trees did not overlap in multidimensional phenotype space, and that few species of trees were visited by more than two pollinator groups. The use of multiple niches is potentially important in understanding both the origin and maintenance of tropical tree diversity.'

Abstract: 'The Swiss stone Pine (Pinus cembra L.) is an alpine species, fairly commonly occurring in the Alps and the Carpathians, close to the timberline. Natural sites of the Swiss stone pine in Poland are found exclusively in the Tatra Mountains, within the area of the Tatra National Park (TNP). In 2017, the health status of the needles of P. cembra was determined and their mycological analysis was carried out. As a result, 11 species of fungi were isolated from the needles showing disease symptoms, manifested by various shades of discoloration. The most frequently observed species was Fusarium oxysporum. It probably does not bring on disease symptoms, but may affect the development of other frequently isolated species (such as Sydowia polyspora, Lophodermium sp. and Lophodermium conigenum) that are pathogenic to Pinus spp.'

Abstract: 'Decalepis salicifolia (Bedd. ex Hook.f.) Venter is a new source of the commercially important flavor compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (2H4MB), a structural isomer of vanillin, with high pharmacological value and used as a flavoring agent at industrial level for making soft drink and bakery products. The natural availability of this high-valued plant is not able to meet the ever-increasing demands due to limited studies. Considering the importance of suspension culture over excised root culture, present communication provides a protocol for the suspension culture of root tuber derived callus of D. salicifolia for the first time. Maximum frequency (84.8%) callus induction was obtained on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium augmented with (1.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) thidiazuron (TDZ)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89(1.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) \xce\xb1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Two important biotic elicitors, chitosan (CH) and yeast extract (YE) at different concentrations (50, 100, 200 and 300\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M) were used as elicitor to investigate the effects on biomass content, 2H4MB content, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant activity in cell suspension culture with different contact periods i.e. 24, 48 72 and 96\xc2\xa0h. The results showed the supremacy of CH over YE and maximum biomass was 9.7 DW g/l at optimum contact period of 72\xc2\xa0h when suspension culture was treated with 200\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M CH. Maximum content of 2H4MB was14.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/g at 200\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M CH and it was found to be 1.4-fold increase in relation to the control (10.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/g). The maximum TPC and TFC were 4.8\xc2\xa0mg/g and 4.0\xc2\xa0mg/g respectively at 200\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M CH and 72\xc2\xa0h of the contact period. The DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity (RSA) had also been evaluated and most of the suspension culture showed the correlation with TPC and TFC. The maximum RSA (63.8%) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (HRSA) (55.2%) were revealed the ability of plant as a potent antioxidant agent. Thus, a new protocol has been developed for\xc2\xa0the elicitors-induced enhancement of metabolites and antioxidant activity in suspension culture of D. salicifolia.'

Abstract: 'Year-round flowering is widely reported in fig trees and is necessary for the survival of their short-living, specialized Agaonid pollinators. However, seasonality in both fig and leaf production has been noted in almost all published phenological studies. We have addressed the following questions in the present study: (1) Are reproductive and vegetative phenologies seasonal and, consequently, related to climate? (2) Does Ficus citrifolia produce ripe figs year round? (3) Is the fig development related to climate? And, (4) Are reproductive and vegetative phenologies independent? By investigating these questions with a F. citrifolia population over a two-year period, at the southern edge of the tropical region in Brazil, we detected phenological seasonality that was significantly correlated with climate. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Trees became deciduous during the cold and dry months; (2) The flowering onset was asynchronous among individuals, but with moderate concentration during the hot and rainy months; (3) There was a correlation between the onset of flowering and vegetative phenology, with significantly higher crop initiations in individuals with full-leaf canopy; (4) Fig developmental time was longer in cold months; and (5) Ripe fig production occurred year-round and was not correlated with climate. Our results suggest that there are strong selection pressures that maintain the year-round flowering phenology in figs, for we have observed little seasonality in the phenology of such species despite the strong seasonality in the environment.'

Abstract: 'Microsatellite markers in small cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum Maton) were developed using the selective hybridization enrichment method. A total of 140 microsatellite repeats were identified from 270 clones. Primers were designed for 58 microsatellites and 44 primer pairs amplified products of expected size in cardamom. These markers were used for studying the diversity of 20 important small cardamom genotypes, and six markers were found to be polymorphic. The number of alleles ranged from 2 to 7 with an average of 3.6 per locus. Polymorphic information content values ranged from 0.14 to 0.38 based on dominant scoring. The two markers ECM 47a and ECMG 28 generated specific banding patterns for the genotypes MCC7 (Pink tiller) and APG434 (MA18) respectively. Dendrogram illustrated the genetic similarity between different genotypes of Kerala and Karnataka regions. It differentiated the closely related genotypes and released varieties into separate groups. Principal coordinate analysis revealed PV1 and ICRI 1 as the most divergent genotypes. The study demonstrated that these markers are informative and can be further utilized for generating reliable molecular data for assisting the crop improvement of small cardamom. Cross generic transferability (71.4\xc2\xa0%) of the developed primers proved that they are useful for phylogenetic studies in the family Zingiberaceae. This is the first report of de novo isolation, characterisation and utilization of microsatellite markers for the genetic diversity analysis of small cardamom.'

Abstract: 'How water should be managed in Monsoon Asia is emerging as one of the core earth system governance challenges. In this article, we explore the politics around pursuits of adaptiveness in water management, emphasizing the major transboundary river basins draining the south and eastern Himalayas. We look at two main functions: storing, diverting and sharing water for periods of scarcity; protecting people and places from destructive floods. We find that the pursuit of adaptiveness will take place partly outside the range of human experience in a context of large differences in exposure and vulnerabilities, disparate interests and unequal power. Anticipatory policies and actions to adapt and improve adaptive capacity to the transboundary impacts of changes in water-use, land-use and climate on water resources and services are still in their infancy; but several problem-framing discourses are emerging that have longer-term implications for water governance. It is not yet clear how these competing policy-frames will evolve in Asia. Much will depend on how systems of water governance develop. Public scrutiny of how governments in Asia plan to adapt to climate change in the water sector\xe2\x80\x94on how risks of not enough and too much water are dealt with\xe2\x80\x94will need to continue to help sort out those projects and strategies which are driven primarily by political benefits from those which actually contribute to building adaptive capacities and maintaining social-ecological resilience.'

Abstract: 'Fuelwood is a predominant source of domestic energy for the Soliga, an aboriginal tribe, and non-Soliga people inhabiting the core and the fringe of the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) wildlife sanctuary in Karnataka, India. Approximately 7000 Soliga and 66000 non-Soliga people depend on the 540 km2 sanctuary for fuelwood. The demand for fuelwood is estimated to be 134.7 t d-1 or 49165 t y-1 against production of 66024 t y-1 for the entire sanctuary. Consumption patterns vary with the season and the altitude. The pressure for fuelwood is far greater on the fringe (85.8%) than in the core (14.2%). The fuelwood supply emanates from an activity zone of 20.1% of the total forest area which produces only 27% of the total demand. Furthermore, only selected species are preferred for fuel use, indicating that only a certain percentage of total productivity is available for extraction. Thus, the demandsupply gap is far greater than it actually appears. A wide gap between demand and supply demonstrates that the BRT forests cannot cater to the fuelwood needs sustainably with the prevailing patterns of extraction. Probable consequences of fuelwood extraction on biodiversity are discussed, and management options to meet energy requirement and to conserve biodiversity are explored.'

Title: 'Heavy metal distribution in sediments of Krishna River basin, India'

Abstract: 'Suspended and bed sediments collected from the entire region of the Krishna River and its major tributaries were analyzed for heavy metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb) by the thin-film energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence technique. There is considerable variation in the concentration of elements towards downstream, which may be due to the variation in the subbasin geology and various degrees of human impact. Suspended particles are enriched in heavy metals throughout the basin relative to bed sediments. The heavy metals are enriched in coarse size fractions (10\xe2\x80\x9390 \xc2\xb5m) throughout the Krishna River except its tributary Bhima, where finer fractions (2 \xc2\xb5m) dominate. Transition elements correlate very well with each other. There is a striking similarity between the bed sediments of Krishna River and the Indian average. When the annual heavy metal flux carried by the Krishna River was estimated, and viewed in relation to the other major riverine transport, the Krishna is seen to be a minor contributor of heavy metals to the Bay of Bengal.'

Abstract: 'This is the first report of in vitro propagation and alkaloid accumulation in callus cultures of Ceropegia juncea Roxb. a source of \xe2\x80\x9cSoma\xe2\x80\x9d drug in Ayurvedic medicine. Multiple shoots and callus induction was optimized by studying the influence of auxins [IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid), NAA (2-Naphthalene acetic acid) and 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.)] and cytokinins [BA (6-benzyladenine) and Kin (Kinetin)] alone and in combinations. The best response for multiple shoot induction was obtained in nodal explants on MS medium supplemented with 7.5 \xce\xbcM Kin (8.5 \xc2\xb1 3 shoots per explants). The shoots were rooted on half strength MS (Murashige and Skoog\xe2\x80\x99s) medium fortified with either IAA or NAA (0.5\xe2\x80\x932.0 \xce\xbcM). The plantlets were transferred directly to the field with 100 % success rate. Supplementation of MS medium with auxins and cytokinins enhanced the growth of callus but inhibited the shoot regeneration in nodal explants. Best callus induction and proliferation observed on MS + 1 \xce\xbcM 2,4-D+5 \xce\xbcM BA. However the maximum cerpegin content (470 \xce\xbcg/g dry weight) was recorded in dried callus derived on MS+10 \xce\xbcM IAA+5 \xce\xbcM BA. Quantitative TLC (Thin layer chromatography) studies of the callus revealed a phytochemical profile similar to that of naturally grown plants. The calli were maintained by subculturing at 4 weeks interval on fresh parent medium over a period of 34 months. The optimized in vitro propagation and callus culture protocol offers the possibilities of using organ/callus culture technique for vegetative propagation and production of cerpegin alkaloid.'

Abstract: 'To minimize the degradation of soil organic matter (SOM) content in conventional sugarcane cropping, it is important to understand how the fungal community contributes to SOM dynamics during the decomposition of sugarcane leaf litter. However, our knowledge of fungal diversity in tropical agroecosystems is currently limited. Thus, we determined the fungal community structure on decomposing sugarcane leaf litter and their response to different soil management systems using the internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS1) amplicon sequencing method afforded by Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). The results indicate that no-tillage had positive effects on the relative abundance of Zygomycota and of some taxa that may prefer a moist environment over conventional tillage, whereas bagasse mulching decreased the richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and had positive effect on the relative abundance of slow-growing taxa, which may prefer poor nutrient substrates. Furthermore, a combination of no-tillage and bagasse mulching increased the abundance of unique OTUs. We suggest that the alteration of fungal communities through the changes in soil management practices produces an effect on litter decomposition.'

Abstract: 'The wide knowledge gaps in invasion biology research that exist in the developing world are crucial impediments to the scientific management and global policymaking on biological invasions. In an effort to fill such knowledge gaps, we present here an inventory of the alien flora of India, based on systematic reviews and rigorous analyses of research studies (ca. 190) published over the last 120\xc2\xa0years (1890\xe2\x80\x932010 AD), and updated with field records of the last two decades. Currently, the inventory comprises of 1,599 species, belonging to 842 genera in 161 families, and constitutes 8.5% of the total Indian vascular flora. The three most species-rich families are Asteraceae (134 spp.), Papilionaceae (114 spp.) and Poaceae (106 spp.), and the three largest genera are Eucalyptus (25 spp.), Ipomoea (22 spp.), and Senna (21 spp.). The majority of these species (812) have no report of escaping from cultivation. Of the remaining subset of 787 species, which have either escaped from intentional cultivation, or spread after unintentional introduction, casuals are represented by 57 spp., casual/naturalised by 114 spp., naturalised by 257 spp., naturalised/invasive by 134 spp., and invasive by 225 spp. Biogeographically, more than one-third (35%) of the alien flora in India has its native ranges in South America, followed by Asia (21%), Africa (20%), Europe (11%), Australia (8%), North America (4%); and cryptogenic (1%). The inventory is expected to serve as the scientific baseline on plant invasions in India, with implications for conservation of global biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Climate change can be particularly hard-hitting for small underdeveloped countries, relying heavily on natural resources for the economy and livelihoods. Nepal is one among these countries, being landlocked, with diverse physiographical characteristics within a relatively small territory and with rugged terrain. Poverty is widespread and the capacity of people and the country to cope with climate change impact is low. The country is dominated by the Asian monsoon system. The main occupation is agriculture, largely based on rain-fed farming practices. Tourism based on high altitude adventures is one of the major sources of income for the country. Nepal has a large hydropower potential. While only 0.75% of the theoretical hydropower potential has been tapped, Nepal can greatly benefit from this natural resource in the future. Climate change can adversely impact upon water resources and other sectors of Nepal. The source of water is mainly summer monsoon precipitation and the melting of the large reserve of snow and glaciers in the Himalayan highlands. Observations show clear evidences of significant warming. The average trend in the country is 0.06\xc2\xb0C per year. The warming rates are progressively higher for high elevation locations. The warming climate has resulted in rapid shrinking of majority of glaciers in Nepal. This paper presents state-of-knowledge on the glacial dynamics in the country based on studies conducted in the past in Shorong, Khumbu, Langtang, Dhaulagiri and Kanchenjunga regions of Nepal. We present recent trends in river flow and an overview of studies on expected changes in the hydrological regime due to climate change. Formation, growth and likely outburst of glacial lake are phenomena directly related to climate change and deglaciation. This paper provides a synopsis of past glacial lake outburst floods impacting Nepal. Further, likely impacts of climate change on other sectors such as agriculture, biodiversity, human health and livelihoods are discussed.'

Title: 'Changes in landuse and landcover along the Dhansiri River channel, Assam \xe2\x80\x94 A remote sensing and GIS approach'

Abstract: 'Information on landuse/landcover change is a critical input for natural resource management policy decisions. Remote sensing data under GIS domain were utilized to evaluate the changes in land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) spanning a period of thirty three years during 1975 to 2008 along the Dhansiri River channel, Assam, India. Seven different types of LU/LC were categorized and out of them cropland was evident as the most important landuse/landcover practices followed by dense mixed jungle in 1975 and the settlement in 2008. Significant reduction (13.02%) in cropland area to settlement was observed. Moreover, teagarden also occupies 0.77% of the total area from cropland and open mixed jungle. The changes in the areas of swampy land as evident from the present study in turn will impact the environmental quality around it and will help to increase the surface run off leading to enhancement of erosion processes. It is believed that the present study will help to contribute towards sustainable land-use planning and management towards protection of extremely rich biodiversity of the North East India with mighty Brahmaputra River system.'

Abstract: 'For forest ecosystem management to be effective, knowledge of the horizontal and vertical structural diversity of a forest is essential. The moist Afromontane highlands of Wondo Genet in south-central Ethiopia present an opportunity to restore and rehabilitate and enhance the ecosystem services to be obtained from this forest sustainably. We focused on the forest structural characteristics to better understand the current forest conditions to assist in the sustainable management of this resource. A total of 75 (20 m \xc3\x97 20 m) quadrats were sampled and diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa5 2 cm and stem height \xe2\x89\xa5 2 m were measured. Species identity and abundance, elevation, slope, and aspect were recorded for each plot. Structural characteristics were computed for each plot. Relationship of topographic factors with vegetation characteristics was conducted using R-Software. A total of 72 woody species was recorded. Whereas, the overall diameter distribution shows an inverted J-shaped curve, the basal area followed a bell-shaped pattern. Five types of population structures are revealed. The mean tree density and basal area was 397.3 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 31.4 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. Only 2.8% of the tree species have densities of >25 stems\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921 and the percentage distribution of trees show 56.2% in the DBH class 2\xe2\x80\x9310 cm, indicating that the forest is dominated by medium-sized trees. Celtis africana (8.81 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921) and Pouteria adolfi-friedericii (5.13 m2\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921) make the highest contribution to the basal area and species importance value index. The families/species with the highest importance value index are Ulmaceae, Fabacea and Sapotaceae. Species abundance (r 2 =0.32, p <0.001) and species richness (r 2 =0.50, p <0.001) are positively related with tree density. Tree density is negatively related with elevation (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.36, p <0.001), slope (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.15, p <0.001) and aspect (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.07, p <0.05). While basal area is negatively related with elevation (r 2 =\xe2\x88\x920.14, p <0.001), it has a positive relationship with tree density (r 2 =0.28, p <0.001 and species richness (r 2 =0.098). Species with poor population structure should be assisted by restoration tasks and further anthropogenic disturbance such as illegal logging and fuel wood extraction should be restricted.'

Title: 'Linking vegetation structure and bird organization: response of mixed-species bird flocks to forest succession in subtropical China'

Abstract: 'As forests undergo natural succession following artificial afforestation, their bird assemblages also change. However, interspecific avian social organization associated with forest succession has not been fully understood, particularly for mixed-species bird flocks. To disentangle how mixed-species flocks change as a function of local forest structure, we analyzed flock characteristics (particularly species richness, flocking frequency and propensity) and vegetation physiognomies along a presumed successional series (early, middle, and advanced) simultaneously in subtropical forests in southern China. As hypothesized, monthly point counts demonstrated that complexity of flocks increases with the progression of natural forest succession at a local scale. Advanced forests differed significantly from pioneering plantations with respect to vegetation structure, flock characteristics and constituents (especially for understory specialists). Importantly, forest succession affected flock patterns particularly in relation to the flocking propensity of regular species, and the frequency of nuclear species (Huet\xe2\x80\x99s fulvetta Alcippe hueti), which in turn determined flocking occurrence at different successional stands. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that understory flocking species (mainly Timaliidae babblers) were significantly associated with intact native canopy cover, complex DBH diversity, as well as high densities of dead trees and large trees, representing a maturity level of successional stands. Our study reveals that the effect of natural forest succession on mixed-species bird flocks is species-specific and guild-dependent. From a conservation perspective, despite a high proliferation of pine plantation in southern China, priority should be placed on protecting the advanced forest with a rich collection of understory flocking specialists.'

Abstract: 'The highest percentage of shoot regeneration of Costus speciosus was achieved using thin rhizome sections and triacontanol (TRIA). Factors affecting the rate of shoot multiplication and rooting with TRIA have been investigated. Initiation of shoot buds was observed when rhizome thin sections were cultured on B5 basal medium supplemented with 5\xce\xbcgl\xe2\x88\x921 TRIA. Shoots with two to three leaves produced roots when cultured on B5 basad medium supplemented with 2 \xce\xbcgl\xe2\x88\x921 TRIA. The well-rooted shoots were hardened and transferred to soil where they showed normal growth and a 100% survival rate was achieved. Results of this study showed that TRIA can be used as an effective growth regulator in the micropropagation and conservation of C. speciosus.'

Abstract: 'Small freshwater fish species (SFFs) (length <25\xc2\xa0cm) are highly rich in vitamin A, calcium, iron etc. and hence, can contribute to social health through nutrient supplement to rural communities. Under the pressure of extensive modern agricultural practices and indiscriminate harvesting, stocks of SFFs are gradually declining and their habitats and breeding grounds are also being deteriorated at faster rate. A better conservationist approach could be carp-SFFs integration which will reduce indiscriminate mass capture fishing of SFFs and will ensure conservation of natural SFFs stocks in their habitats providing economic benefit to stakeholders. Different studies have already showed success story of SFF polyculture through carp\xe2\x80\x94SFFs integration. This production cum conservation practice leads to sustainability\xe2\x80\x94a better term in fishery is \xe2\x80\x98social fishery\xe2\x80\x99. However, the part which needs attention is the feeding ecology of SFFs to understand within and between species (with carps) food partitioning and habitat preference as better culture cum conservational approach.'

Abstract: 'Compilation of alien flora from phytogeographically distinct regions is of immediate relevance not only for better understanding the patterns of plant invasion but also for explicating the processes promoting invasion at local, regional or global scales. Despite being at higher risk of invasion by plants because of its European colonial past, south Asia has received very little attention in respect of characterization of its alien flora. This paucity of baseline data necessitated compilation of the first catalogue of alien flora from the Kashmir Himalaya\xe2\x80\x94a phytogeographically distinct south Asian region nestled in the northwestern folds of Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. Total alien flora of the region is represented by 571 plant species, belonging to 352 genera and 104 families. It constitutes a relatively higher (29%) proportion of the total flora of the region. Families with largest number of alien representatives are Poaceae (60 species), Asteraceae (54 species), and Brassicaceae (30 species). However, families such as Amaranthaceae (83%) and Chenopodiacae (71%) show higher percentage of aliens relative to their total number of plant species in the region. Most of the alien plant species (38%) trace their origin to Europe, followed by Asia (27%) and Africa (15%). Present study also reports, for the first time, occurrence of seven plant species in this region. Each alien plant species is provided with information on the origin, habit, mode/purpose of introduction, current invasion status, altitudinal range and the primary published source.'

Abstract: 'Although tropical rain forests represent the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem on the planet, the three main rain forest regions (Neotropics, South-East Asia and continental Africa) are not equally diverse. Africa has been labeled the \xe2\x80\x9codd man out\xe2\x80\x9d because of its perceived lower species diversity when compared to the Neotropics or South-East Asia. Understanding why, within a biome, certain regions have higher or lower species diversity provides important insights into the evolution of biodiversity. I review the evidence in favor of an \xe2\x80\x9codd man out\xe2\x80\x9d pattern and the different hypotheses that have been advanced to explain and test this pattern using recent ecological, biogeographical and diversification studies. The \xe2\x80\x9codd man out\xe2\x80\x9d pattern has yet to be formally tested using extensive inventory plot data (including non woody species) between all three major rain forest regions based on appropriate statistics in an area controlled manner. The lower species diversity is not the result of a single cause, but is probably linked to numerous intricate causes related to present and past events. Future comparative studies should combine numerous variables including novel ones such at plant functional diversity. Finally, though more extinction in Africa is apparent from the fossil record, it is still hard to precisely quantify to what degree extinction varied between the three major regions. Diversification studies of important tropical plant lineages tend to support higher speciation rates in the Neotropics and South-East Asia instead of higher extinction in Africa as the main cause explaining the differences in species diversity. The lower species diversity of African rain forests remains an understudied question with numerous preconceived and largely untested ideas for which we are still far from having a synthetic explanation. This review highlights that there are still very little intercontinental rain forest comparisons of plant species diversity hindering any solid conclusions. To better address this, an integrative approach involving archeologists, climatologists and biologists coupled with data from all three regions should be privileged.'

Abstract: 'The launch of Cartosat-1 turns into a new era for user communities of remote sensing and mapping. Generation of digital elevation model (DEM) of a particular geographic region of interest is the primary goal and advantage of Cartosat-1 mission. To generate the most accurate DEM from Cartosat-1 stereo data, 34 GCP points were used, and 122 tie points are automatically extracted with the aid of LPS-2011. Here, an attempt has been made to study the quantitative hypsometric analysis of six sub-watersheds of the Kuttiyadi River Basin (676\xc2\xa0km2) with a humid tropical setting, using Cartosat-1 DEM. An extension, CalHypso, an add-on tool to ArcGIS 9.2, was utilized to synthesize hypsometric data from Cartosat-1 DEM which reflects the erosional signature of sub-watersheds based on geological stages of development. From hypsometric analysis, it is found that three sub-watersheds are in old stage, and the remaining three are of mature stage.'

Abstract: 'Ridge top ecosystems (RTEs) are considered to be more sensitive to global warming as they are characterized by uniform sunlight exposure and low human interferences and hence are perfect places for monitoring and comparing the effects of climate change in species composition. The present study was carried out on RTEs of four different mountain ranges, viz. (1) Narendranagar\xe2\x80\x93Hindolakhal (2) Mussoorie\xe2\x80\x93Dhanolti (3) Chaurangikhal\xe2\x80\x93Harunta and (4) Dayara\xe2\x80\x93Gidara, along altitudinal gradient (situated below 2000 to above 3500\xc2\xa0m), in Garhwal Himalaya to understand the variation in tree composition and distribution range. 0.1\xc2\xa0ha-sized sample plot was used to analyze the tree species, whereas 5\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0m for saplings and 1\xc2\xa0m\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0m for seedlings. The tree layers on RTEs were consisted of total 69 tree species, belonging to 55 genera and 39 families. Shorea robusta, Pinus roxburghii, Rhododendron arboreum, Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. floribunda, Q. semecarpifolia, Cedrus deodara, Pinus wallichiana and Abies spectabilis were found as the dominant and well-occupied tree species on the RTEs from lower to higher elevations. The mean stand density was recorded as 597\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa029 trees ha\xe2\x88\x921 (ranged between 546 and 616 trees ha\xe2\x88\x921) with a mean basal cover of 77.25\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa017.90\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 (ranged between 54.43 and 102.83\xc2\xa0m2 ha\xe2\x88\x921). A traditional pattern for tree diversity was recorded which decreased with increasing altitude. The detrended correspondence analysis ordination plot clumped the species together which shared the same habitat and environmental conditions which revealed that elevation and geographic location were the dominant factors for regional differences in species composition among RTEs.\n\n'

Title: 'Soil moisture response to rainfall in forestland and vegetable plot in Taihu Lake Basin, China'

Abstract: 'Soil moisture and its spatial pattern are important for understanding various hydrological, pedological, ecological and agricultural processes. In this study, data of rainfall and soil moisture contents at different depths (10 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm and 60 cm) in forestland and vegetable plot in the Taihu Lake Basin, China were monitored and analyzed for characteristics of soil moisture variation and its response to several typical rainfall events. The following results were observed. First, great temporal variation of soil moisture was observed in the surface layer than in deeper layer in vegetable plot. In contrast, in forestland, soil moisture had similar variation pattern at different depths. Second, initial soil moisture was an important factor influencing the vertical movement of soil water during rainfall events. In vegetable plot, simultaneous response of soil moisture to rainfall was observed at 10- and 20-cm depths due to fast infiltration when initial soil was relatively dry. However, traditional downward response order occurred when initial soil was relatively wet. Third, critical soil horizon interface was an active zone of soil water accumulation and lateral movement. A less permeable W-B soil horizon interface (40-cm depth) in vegetable plot can create perched water table above it and elevate the soil water content at the corresponding depth. Fourth, the land cover was an effective control factor of soil moisture during small and moderate rainfall events. In the forestland, moderate and small rainfall events had tiny influences on soil moisture due to canopy and surface O horizon interception. Fifth, preferential flow and lateral subsurface interflow were important paths of soil water movement. During large and long duration rainfall events, lateral subsurface flow and preferential flow through surface crack or soil pipe occurred, which recharged the deep soil. However, in more concentrated large storm, surface crack or soil pipe connected by soil macropores was the main contributor to the occurrence of preferential flow. Findings of this study provide a theoretical foundation for sustainable water and fertilizer management and land use planning in the Taihu Lake Basin.'

Abstract: 'Ecotones have received great attention due to its critical function in energy flux, species harbor, global carbon sequestration, and land-atmosphere interaction. This study investigated land use pattern and spatial heterogeneity of the ecotones among agricultural land, forest land, and grassland of the southeastern Da Hinggan Mountains in the northeastern China. The change of these delineated ecotones under different slopes and aridity conditions was analyzed by two landscape indices, edge density (ED) and core area percentage of landscape (CPL), to explore the inter-linkage between spatial structure of ecotones and socioeconomic development and land management. Specifically, the ecotones such as agriculture-forest (AF) ecotone, forest-grassland (FG) ecotone, and agriculture-forest-grassland (AFG) ecotone moved from the arid southeast to the humid northwest. The flat area with small slope is more edge-fragmented than the steep area since the ED decreases as the slope increases. The AF ecotone mostly found in the humid region is moving to more humid areas while the agriculture-grassland (AG) ecotone mostly found in the dry region is moving towards the drier region.'

Abstract: 'In the present study, a simple one medium formulation protocol for callus culture, somatic embryogenesis and in vitro production of \xce\xb2-carboline alkaloids and diosgenin in Tribulus terrestris L. was developed. Extensive callus induction and proliferation was obtained in leaf explant on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 5.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM 6 benzyl adenine (BA) and 2.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The embryogenic callus was maintained on subculture to fresh parental medium at 4-week intervals over a period of 28\xc2\xa0months. The frequency of embryo formation was at a maximum (18.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.9 per g of callus) on MS medium containing 5.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA and 2.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM NAA together with 75\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 casein hydrolysate. Globular embryo developed into torpedo stage embryo under the influence of starvation. The accumulation of \xce\xb2-carboline alkaloids (harmaline and harmine) and steroidal saponin (diosgenin) in non-embryogenic and embryogenic callus culture derived from leaf explant was compared with root, leaf, stem, and fruit of the mother plant. The embryogenic callus accumulated equivalent amounts of harmaline (66.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g dry weight), harmine (82.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.6\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g dry weight), and diosgenin (170.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.0\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g dry weight) to that of the fruit of T. terrestris. The embryogenic callus culture of this species might offer a potential source for production of important pharmaceuticals.'

Abstract: '\nThis study quantifies biomass, aboveground and belowground net productivity, along with additional environmental factors over a 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0year period in Barnawapara Sanctuary of Chhattisgarh, India through satellite remote-sensing and GIS techniques. Ten sampling quadrates 20\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa020, 5\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05 and 1\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0m were randomly laid for overstorey (OS), understorey (US) and ground vegetation (GS), respectively. Girth of trees was measured at breast height and collar diameters of shrubs and herbs at 0.1\xc2\xa0m height. Biomass was estimated using allometric regression equations and herb biomass by harvesting. Net primary productivity (NPP) was determined by summing biomass increment and litter crop values. Aspect and slope influenced the vegetation types, biomass and NPP in different forests. Standing biomass and NPP varied from 18.6 to 101.5\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 5.3 to 12.7\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 a\xe2\x88\x921, respectively, in different forest types. The highest biomass was found in dense mixed forest, while net production recoded in Teak forests. Both were lowest in degraded mixed forests of different forest types. OS, US and GS contributed 90.4, 8.7 and 0.7%, respectively, for the total mean standing biomass in different forests. This study developed spectral models for the estimation of biomass and NPP using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and other vegetation indices. The study demonstrated the potential of geospatial tools for estimation of biomass and net productivity of dry tropical forest ecosystem.\n'

Abstract: 'The purpose of this study is to address prediction of the start date and the duration of breaks in the summer monsoon rains using multi-model superensemble. The availability of datasets from the \xe2\x80\x98observing system research and predictability experiment (THORPEX)\xe2\x80\x99 initiated a forecast data archive, called THORPEX interactive grand global ensemble (TIGGE), makes it possible to use forecasts from a suite of individual ensemble prediction systems (member models) and to construct multi-model superensemble forecasts that are designed to remove the collective bias errors of the suite of models. Precipitation datasets are important for this study, we have used high resolution daily gridded rainfall dataset of India Meteorological Department (IMD), in addition to rainfall estimates from tropical rainfall microwave mission (TRMM) satellite and the CPC morphing technique (CMORPH). The scientific approach of this study entails the use of a multi-model superensemble for forecast and to verify against the rainfall information during a training phase, as well as during a forecast phase. We examine the results of forecasts out to day-10 and ask how well do forecast strings of day-1 through day-10 handle the prediction of the onset and duration of the breaks in the summer monsoon rains. Our results confirm that it is possible to predict the onset of a dry spell, around week in advance from the use of the multi-model superensemble and a suite of TIGGE models. We also examine trajectories of the parcels arriving in India in such forecasts from member models and from the multi-model superensemble to validate the arrival of descending dry desert air from the Arabian region during the dry spells and its mode of transition from wet spell. Some phenological features such as a shift in the latitude of the tropical easterly jet and changes in its intensity during break periods are additional observed features that are validated from the history of multi-model superensemble forecasts. Invariably this multi-model superensemble performs better than any single model in proving the better forecasts during our experiment period.'

Abstract: 'Belgaum city is a developmental hub of Karnataka State in India. In the recent time, the Government of Karnataka has planned to set up many processing industries in the vicinity of Belgaum to meet the growing needs of the region and to ease out the pressure on the already existing industrial hubs in Karnataka State. Ghataprabha, a tributary of river Krishna, is one of the major sources of water supply to Belgaum city and adjoining areas. During the last decade, a lot of anthropogenic activities such as unplanned agricultural activities are ongoing in many parts of the catchment. Therefore, people of Belgaum are more concerned about the quality of water in Ghataprabha river. Considering the significance of water quality of the river, surface water samples were collected during Pre- and Post-monsoon season from selected locations and analyzed for both physical and chemical constituents in the laboratory. The results indicate that the chemical parameters such as bicarbonates, sulphates, chlorides, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium are within the permissible limits. QUAL2E model was applied to assess the impact of point and non-point sources of pollution on the river water quality. Results show that the water quality conditions are highly acceptable all along the river stretch. Further, the variation of DO\xe2\x80\x93BOD5 with river discharge was also estimated. Also, a significant variations in DO (decrease in DO) with the increase in river flow was observed. However, at the downstream end, considerable improvement in DO was noticed which is attributed to the damming effect of the reservoir.'

Abstract: 'Knowledge of the genetic diversity in the germplasm accessions is important for the efficient germplasm management. We studied 45 colored rice accessions, which had been earlier collected from peninsular India. The accessions were evaluated at two diverse locations for 12 morpho-agronomic traits and genotyped using 50 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Significant genotypic variability was observed for all morpho-agronomic traits studied. Dendrogram and principal component analysis based on morpho-agronomic traits separated the accessions into three clusters. The first two principal components accounted for 82% of the total variation. The most discriminatory traits were number of grains per panicle, biomass yield, and days to flowering and maturity. The SSR analysis revealed high polymorphic information content value of 0.84. Though, Mantel test did not show a significant correlation, yet the classification based on phenotyping and genotyping data showed good agreement for the expression of morpho-agronomic traits in the formation of clusters. Five accessions had high concentration (>\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/g) of Fe and one of Zn. Our study revealed the presence of large genetic variation among the colored rice accessions evaluated and moderate agreement between morpho-agronomic and SSR\xe2\x80\x93based classifications and of these with geographic diversity.'

Abstract: 'This paper is intended to compute long-term spatiotemporal variability of precipitation on annual and seasonal scale of Damodar River Basin over the period of 113\xc2\xa0years (1901\xe2\x80\x932013). The lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient was applied to check serial dependence in the dataset. After this, non-parametric Mann Kendall and modified Mann Kendall test were used to identify trends and the Theil-Sen\xe2\x80\x99s slope method to estimate magnitude of trend line. Sequential Mann Kendall test was also applied to detect the potential turning point. Results found significant decreasing precipitation trend in annual and monsoon season over the basin except the southeastern part. The maximum decrease was found for annual and monsoon season at the northwestern part while minimum at the northeastern region. The sequential Mann Kendall test identified several non-significant as well as significant turning points for seasonal and annual rainfall at most of the locations.'

Abstract: 'The present work accentuated the expediency of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) applications in groundwater studies, especially in the identification of groundwater potential zones in Ithikkara River Basin (IRB), Kerala, India. The information on geology, geomorphology, lineaments, slope and land use/land cover was gathered from Landsat ETM + data and Survey of India (SOI) toposheets of scale 1:50,000 in addition, GIS platform was used for the integration of various themes. The composite map generated was further classified according to the spatial variation of the groundwater potential. Four categories of groundwater potential zones namely poor, moderate, good and very good were identified and delineated. The hydrogeomorphological units like valley fills and alluvial plain and are potential zones for groundwater exploration and development and valley fills associated with lineaments is highly promising area for groundwater extraction. The spatial variation of the potential indicates that groundwater occurrence is controlled by geology, structures, slope and landforms.'

Abstract: 'Urdbean leaf crinkle disease (ULCD) is an economically significant widespread and devastating disease resulting in extreme crinkling, puckering and rugosity of leaves inflicting heavy yield losses annually in major urdbean-producing countries of the world. This disease is caused by urdbean leaf crinkle virus (ULCV). Urdbean (Vigna mungo L. Hepper) is relatively more susceptible than other pulses to leaf crinkle disease. Urdbean is an important and useful crop cultivated in various parts of South-East Asia and well adapted for cultivation under semi-arid and subtropical conditions. Aphids, insects and whiteflies have been reported as vectors of the disease. The virus is also transmitted through sap inoculation, grafting and seed. The loss in seed yield in ULCD-affected urdbean crop ranges from 35 to 81\xc2\xa0%, which is dependent upon type of genotype location and infection time. The diseased material and favourable climatic conditions contribute for the widespread viral disease. Anatomical and biochemical changes take place in the affected diseased plants. Genetic variations have been reported in the germplasm screening which suggest continuous screening of available varieties and new germplasm to search for new traits (new genes) and identify new sources of disease resistance. There are very few reports on breeding programmes for the development and release of varieties tolerant to ULCD. Mostly random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) as well as inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular markers have been utilized for fingerprinting of blackgram, and a few reports are there on sequence-tagged micro-satellite site (STMS) markers. There are so many RNA viruses which have also developed strategies to counteract silencing process by encoding suppressor proteins that create hindrances in the process. But, in the case of ULCV, there is no report available indicating which defence pathway is operating for its resistance in the plants and whether same silencing suppression strategy is also followed by this virus causing leaf crinkle disease in urdbean. The antiviral principles (AVP) present in leaf extracts of several plants are known to inhibit infection by many viruses. Many chemicals have been reported as inhibitors of virus replication in plants. Raising the barrier crops also offers an effective solution to control the spread of virus.'

Abstract: 'Due to increasing trend of intensive rice cultivation in a coastal river basin, crop planning and groundwater management areimperative for the sustainable agriculture. For effective management, two models have been developed viz. groundwater balance model and optimum cropping and groundwater management model to determine optimum cropping pattern and groundwater allocation from private and government tubewells according to different soil types (saline and non-saline), type of agriculture(rainfed and irrigated) and seasons (monsoon and winter). A groundwater balance model has been developed considering mass balance approach. The components of the groundwater balance considered are recharge from rainfall, irrigated rice and non-rice fields, base flow from rivers and seepage flow from surface drains. In the second phase, a linear programming optimization model is developed for optimal cropping and groundwater management for maximizing the economic returns. Themodels developed were applied to a portion of coastal river basin in Orissa State, India and optimal cropping pattern forvarious scenarios of river flow and groundwater availability wasobtained.'

Abstract: 'Clado- and semogenetic approaches, when used in concert, make it possible to resolve questions concerning the phylogenetic relationships between group representatives, as well as the phylogenesis of those representatives\xe2\x80\x99 characters. Parental care patterns and other forms of reproductive behavior, along with the reproductive strategy as a whole, can be the subject of semogenetic analysis to no less an extent than morphological structures sensu stricto. One highly specialized form of parental care in fish, including representatives of the suborder of labyrinth fishes and their sister groups, appears to be parental food provisioning. In our view, the evolutionary origin of postembryonic brood provisioning in bony fishes is characterized by three main features: (1) in fish, different forms of postembryonic food provisioning are convergent in their origin; (2) any kind of brood provisioning is realized through exploitation of the already existing character and is maintained by selection due to an enhancement of offspring fitness; (3) the main evolutionary path of the emergence and development of this phenomenon consists in function expansion and replacement. The hypothesis does have heuristic power, since it enables prediction of the presence of the reproductive strategy component in question through the identification of adequate basic adaptations. Although parental care occurs in the majority of anabantoid fishes, there are still several species for which such care is not known. On the cladogram, these species by no means take the basal position but are surrounded by fishes that provide care for their eggs, or even their hatchlings. The parsimony principle leads to the suggestion that parental care is a plesiomorphic character in the suborder Anabantoidei (or in the order Anabantiformes). It seems that the ancestors of present day noncarrying species that take various positions within this phylogenetic group were fishes showing parental care. Their reproductive strategy later changed as a result of r selection. If this hypothesis is correct, the absence of parental care should be considered a case of reproductive strategy degradation. It is quite probable that parental food provisioning was a component of the ancestral reproductive strategies. It is also possible that the reproductive strategy of present-day anabantoids that supposedly do not care for their offspring actually includes some optional forms of parental care.'

Abstract: 'This paper looks at the crucial issue of dry-season groundwater-availability in the state of Maharashtra, India. We look at the two key hydro-climatological measurements which are used to implement groundwater policy in the state, viz., water levels in 5000 + observation wells across the state and aggregate rainfall data. We see that there is substantial variation in groundwater levels within and across the years in most wells. We argue that for a large number of these observation well locations, aggregate rainfall data is inadequate to model or to predict groundwater levels. For this, we use a novel random rainfall coefficient model for the purpose of modelling the effect of rainfall in a composite setting where extraction and changing land-use data is unknown. The observed high variance of this coefficient points to significant variations in groundwater levels, which may only be explained by unmeasured anthropogenic factors. Next, we see that the uncertainty in actual groundwater levels along with scarcity are two distinct features of groundwater availability and will elicit different behaviours from the typical user. Finally, we recommend that quantitative groundwater assessment protocols of the state should move to incorporating data from which extraction and land-use may be modelled. We believe this is one of the first studies where large spatio-temporal scale data gathered by state agencies have been analysed for scientific adequacy.'

Abstract: 'The performance of 11 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center (APCC) global climate models (coupled and uncoupled both) in simulating the seasonal summer (June\xe2\x80\x93August) monsoon rainfall variability over Asia (especially over India and East Asia) has been evaluated in detail using hind-cast data (3\xc2\xa0months advance) generated from APCC which provides the regional climate information product services based on multi-model ensemble dynamical seasonal prediction systems. The skill of each global climate model over Asia was tested separately in detail for the period of 21\xc2\xa0years (1983\xe2\x80\x932003), and simulated Asian summer monsoon rainfall (ASMR) has been verified using various statistical measures for Indian and East Asian land masses separately. The analysis found a large variation in spatial ASMR simulated with uncoupled model compared to coupled models (like Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia, National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Japan Meteorological Agency). The simulated ASMR in coupled model was closer to Climate Prediction Centre Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) compared to uncoupled models although the amount of ASMR was underestimated in both models. Analysis also found a high spread in simulated ASMR among the ensemble members (suggesting that the model\xe2\x80\x99s performance is highly dependent on its initial conditions). The correlation analysis between sea surface temperature (SST) and ASMR shows that that the coupled models are strongly associated with ASMR compared to the uncoupled models (suggesting that air-sea interaction is well cared in coupled models). The analysis of rainfall using various statistical measures suggests that the multi-model ensemble (MME) performed better compared to individual model and also separate study indicate that Indian and East Asian land masses are more useful compared to Asia monsoon rainfall as a whole. The results of various statistical measures like skill of multi-model ensemble, large spread among the ensemble members of individual model, strong teleconnection (correlation analysis) with SST, coefficient of variation, inter-annual variability, analysis of Taylor diagram, etc. suggest that there is a need to improve coupled model instead of uncoupled model for the development of a better dynamical seasonal forecast system.'

Abstract: 'Mountain ecosystem, on the earth, has plenty of natural resources. In Himachal Pradesh all the rivers are snowfed and therefore rich in water resources. These resources have been supporting enough for the generation of electricity through introducing hydropower projects since the last decade. However, every developmental activity has its own negative impacts on the surrounding environment. Due to the fragile nature of topography and delicacy of ecology of the Himalaya, it results in lot of disturbances because of high degree of human interferences like construction of major hydropower projects. The increased extent of geological hazards, such as landslides, rock fall and soil erosion, have mainly due to alike developmental interventions in the natural ecosystem. So understanding and analysing such impacts of the hydropower projects have mainly been on the environment in various forms but natural hazards have been frequent ones. The present study, therefore, focuses mainly on the Parbati Stage II (800 MW) and the Parbati Stage III (520 MW) hydropower projects; both of which fall within the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. Based on the perception survey of the local communities, the existing land use pattern, status of total acquired land of the residents by hydropower projects, frequent natural hazards and resultant loss to the local communities due to upcoming construction of hydropower projects surrounding to the Parbati Stage II and III have been analysed in the paper. Also, the preventive measures to mitigate these adverse impacts have been suggested to strengthen these projects in eco-friendly manner in the mountain context.'

Abstract: ' Corallodiscus lanuginosus is distributed 12,000\xc2\xa0km across its northeast\xe2\x80\x93southwest boundaries, showing its highest morphological diversity in the Hengduan Mountains, Southwest China. We investigated the mechanisms behind the high diversity in this species. We acquired ITS sequence data across the distribution range of the genus, reconstructed dated phylogenies, projected the resulting clades onto geographic maps and linked the results with inferred ploidy levels of the populations. We found strong geographic patterns for the ITS clades but with extensively overlapping ranges, particularly in the Hengduan Mountains area. We deduced an origin of C. lanuginosus in the mid-Oligocene. We used the presence of ITS polymorphisms to infer a high level of hybridization events mainly in areas of clade overlap, where we also inferred repeated tetraploidization events to have taken place. Pre- and post-Quaternary climate oscillation-driven expansions and contractions of distribution ranges have allowed secondary contacts, hybridization and introgression that shaped the current patchy distribution of morphological diversity in the species. Polyploidization as a reinforcing genetic barrier added to the genetic diversity in space and time particularly in the Hengduan Mountains.'

Abstract: ' The broad climatological features associated with the Asian monsoon circulation, including its mean state and intraseasonal and interannual variability over the Indian subcontinent as simulated in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) global coupled climate system model (CSM) in its control reference experiment, are presented in this paper. The CSM reproduces the seasonal cycle as well as basic observed patterns of key climatic parameters reasonably well in spite of some limitations in simulation of the monsoon rainfall. However, while the seasonality in rainfall over the region is simulated well, the simulated area-averaged monsoon rainfall is underestimated to only about 60% of the observed rainfall. The centers of maxima in simulated monsoon rainfall are slightly displaced southward as compared to the climatological patterns. The cross-equatorial flow in simulated surface wind patterns during summer is also stronger than observed with an easterly bias. The transient experiment with a 1% per year compound increase in CO2 with CSM suggests an annual mean area-averaged surface warming of about 1.73\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C over the region at the time of CO2 doubling. This warming is more pronounced in winter than during the monsoon season. A net increase in area-averaged monsoon rainfall of about 1.4\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0day\xe2\x80\x931, largely due to increased moisture convergence and associated convective activity over the land, is obtained. The enhanced intraseasonal variability in the monsoon rainfall in a warmer atmosphere is confined to the early part of the monsoon season which suggests the possibility of the date of onset of summer monsoon over India becoming more variable in future. The enhanced interannual and intraseasonal variability in the summer monsoon activity over India could also contribute to more intense rainfall spells over the land regions of the Indian subcontinent, thus increasing the probability of extreme rainfall events in a warmer atmosphere.'

Title: 'Litter decomposition and nitrogen mineralization of soils in subtropical plantation forests of southern China, with special attention to comparisons between legumes and non-legumes'

Abstract: 'Litter decomposition and nitrogen mineralization were investigated in subtropical plantation forests in southern China. The CO2 \xe2\x80\x93C release from incubated litter and the forest floor of Acacia mangium, Acacia auriculaeformis, Eucalyptus citriodora, Pinus elliotii and Schima superba stands were used to estimate relative rates of litter decomposition. Decomposition was not positively correlated with litter nitrogen. E. citridora litter decomposed most rapidly and A. mangium litter most slowly, both with and without the addition of exotic nitrogen. Aerobic incubation and intact soil core incubation at 30 \xc2\xb0C over a period of 30 days were used to assess nitrogen mineralization of six forest soils. Although there were differences in results obtained using the two methods, patterns between legume and non-legume species were the same regardless of method. All soils had pH values below 4.5, but this did not prevent nitrification. The dominant form of mineral nitrogen was nitrate for legume species and ammonium for non-legume species. The nitrogen mineralization potential was highest for soils in which legumes were growing.'

Title: 'Nitrogen deep-placement technologies for productivity, profitability, and environmental quality of rainfed lowland rice systems'

Abstract: 'The recovery of applied nitrogen by rice is low due to several loss processes operating in the ricefields. Split application of fertilizer suggested for increasing nitrogen-use efficiency is often not practical in rainfed lowland rice due to adverse soil\xe2\x80\x93water situations. Hence, the entire required amount of N has to be applied in one single application when the water regime is favorable. A single broadcast application, however, increases N loss. Deep placement of urea supergranules (USG) has been proven to improve N fertilizer efficiency. The placement technology is best suited to conditions where the predominant N loss mechanism is ammonia volatilization rather than leaching or denitrification. Deep placement of USG thus has greater benefit over surface split application on soils with moderate to heavy texture, low permeability and percolation rate, and high cation exchange capacity and pH. Environments and management factors conducive to high ammonia volatilization potential would benefit most from deep-placement technology. Improved N recovery and efficiency of USG has been well-documented for lowland rice, but its market availability and methods to achieve placement pose problems. The technology has very limited adoption because USG is not commercially available or manufactured in most countries, and labor requirement is high with hand placement. Manual application creates more difficulties in handling the granules, besides taking 36\xe2\x80\x9342 more hours per hectare, than 2 split broadcast applications of prilled urea. Applicators developed so far have not worked satisfactorily under standing water conditions and in direct-seeded rice conditions due to hardness of the soil. Hence, it is necessary to develop a suitable applicator to overcome these difficulties. Alternatively, for direct-seeded rice, N-fertilizers can be subsoil-banded near seedrows. The placement technology, if adopted by the farmers of the potential lowland areas in eastern India, is expected to give an additional production of 5.6 million tons of rice.'

Title: 'Hydrogeochemical characterization and evaluation of groundwater quality in Kangayam taluk, Tirupur district, Tamil Nadu, India, using GIS techniques'

Abstract: 'The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater and its suitability for drinking water supply in Kangayam taluk, Tirupur district, Tamil Nadu, India. To achieve this objective, seventy-eight groundwater samples were collected from the wells spread over the study area during December 2016. The collected groundwater samples were tested in the laboratory for various hydrogeochemical parameters such as hydrogen ion concentration (pH), electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, carbonate, nitrate, sulphate and fluoride. The analytical results were compared with WHO drinking water standards to assess the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes. To understand the spatial variation of hydrogeochemical parameters over the study area, choropleth (zonation) maps were prepared using geographical information system (GIS). Overall groundwater quality zones were demarcated by overlaying and integrating all the spatial plots using GIS. Three groundwater quality zones such as (1) most desirable, (2) maximum allowable and (3) not permissible were demarcated based on the limits prescribed by the WHO for drinking purposes. This study indicates that 49% of the study area does not possess potable groundwater. About 21% of the area represents \xe2\x80\x9cmost desirable\xe2\x80\x9d category, and the remaining 30% area represents \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum allowable\xe2\x80\x9d category for drinking purposes. The Piper\xe2\x80\x99s trilinear diagram indicates that groundwater of this region is Mixed CaMgCl type. As the groundwater quality is poor nearly 49% of the total area, it is necessary to go for treatment before drinking water supply. It is also essential to recharge the aquifer artificially to improve the quantity and quality of groundwater.'

Abstract: 'IAEG Commission No. 1\xe2\x80\x94Engineering Geological Maps\xe2\x80\x94is developing a guide to hazard maps. Scientists from 17 countries have participated. This paper is one of a series that presents the results of that work. It provides a general review of GIS landslide mapping techniques and basic concepts of landslide mapping. Three groups of maps are considered: maps of spatial incidence of landslides, maps of spatial\xe2\x80\x93temporal incidence and forecasting of landslides and maps of assessment of the consequences of landslides. With the current era of powerful microcomputers and widespread use of GIS packages, large numbers of papers on the subject are becoming available, frequently founded on different basic concepts. In order to achieve a better understanding and comparison, the concepts proposed by Varnes (Landslide hazard zonation: a review of principles and practice, 1984) and Fell (Some landslide risk zoning schemes in use in Eastern Australua and their application 1992; Landslide risk assessment and acceptable risk. Can Geotech J 31:261\xe2\x80\x93272, 1994) are taken as references. It is hoped this will also add to the international usefulness of these maps as tools for landslide prevention and mitigation. Six hundred and sixty one papers and books related to the topic are included in the references, many of which are reviewed in the text.'

Title: 'Soil organic carbon content at a range of north Australian tropical savannas with contrasting site histories'

Abstract: 'Soils play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and can be major source or sink of CO2 depending upon land use, vegetation type and soil management practices. Natural and human impact on soil carbon concentration and storage is poorly understood in native north Australian savanna, yet this represents the largest carbon store in the ecosystem. To gain understanding of possible management impacts on this carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) of the top 1m of red earth sands and sandy loams common in the region was sampled at 5 sites with different vegetation cover and site history (fire regime and tree removal). SOC was high when compared to other published values for savannas and was more comparable with dry-deciduous tropical forests. Sites sampled in this study represent high rainfall savannas of northern Australia (> 1700\xc2\xa0mm annual rainfall) that feature frequent burning (2 in 3\xc2\xa0years or more frequent) and a cycle of annual re-growth of tall C4 grasses that dominate the savanna understorey. These factors may be responsible for the higher than expected SOC levels of the surface soils, despite high respiration rates. Medium term fire exclusion (15\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0years) at one of the sampled sites (Wildlife Park) dramatically reduced the grassy biomass of the understorey. This site had lower SOC levels when compared to the grass dominated and frequently burnt sites, which may be due to a reduction in detrital input to surface (0\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xa0cm) soil carbon pools. Exclusion of trees also had a significant impact on both the total amount and distribution of soil organic carbon, with tree removal reducing observed SOC at depth (100\xc2\xa0cm). Soil carbon content was higher in the wet season than that in the dry season, but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results indicated that annual cycle of grass growth and wildfire resulted in small carbon accumulation in the upper region of the soil, and removal of woody plants resulted in significant carbon losses to recalcitrant, deep soil horizons greater than 80\xc2\xa0cm depth.'

Abstract: 'At an elephant camp in central Myanmar (Burma), we interviewed mahouts and veterinarians to describe the diet of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in a mixed-deciduous forest. Elephants showed a broad dietary breadth (103 plant species from 42 families); consumed mostly browse (94% of plant species); and were very selective about plant parts [e.g., many trees were eaten exclusively for their bark (22%) or fruits (14%)]. The fruits from 29 plant species were recorded to be eaten by elephants. Several of these were found as fruit remains, seeds, or seedlings in elephant dung, suggesting a role of Asian elephants in seed dispersal. Work elephants and their mahouts prove to be a rich source of information to understand wild elephant ecology.'

Title: 'Improved in vitro propagation, genetic stability and analysis of corosolic acid synthesis in regenerants of Lagerstroemia speciosa (L.) Pers. by HPLC and gene expression profiles'

Abstract: 'A rapid in vitro propagation protocol for large-scale cultivation of Lagerstroemia speciosa L., an important medicinal and ornamental tree was established using nodal explants in Schenk and Hildebrandt (SH) medium optimized with various concentration and combinations of auxins and cytokinins. The study revealed, for the first time, accumulation of corosolic acid (CRA), an anti-diabetic and anti-obese pentacyclic triterpene in the in vitro plantlets. Multiple shoot induction was maximum in SH medium supplemented with 4.44\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M Benzyl Amino Purine (BAP) and shoot initials, when transferred to SH medium supplemented with 2.22\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5M BAP, resulted in shoot multiplication and elongation. Rooted plantlets, after 2\xc2\xa0weeks of hardening in mist-house and 3\xc2\xa0months of rearing under shade-net, transferred to forest segments showed successful establishment (100\xc2\xa0%). In a short duration of 24\xc2\xa0weeks, ~2,450 hardened plantlets were obtained from a single nodal explant. The ISSR banding profiles of the regenerants and the mother plant were highly monomorphic and similarity matrix (0.96\xe2\x80\x930.99) confirmed genetic fidelity of the clones. Chemical analysis using HPLC showed that CRA content is more in mature (0.012\xe2\x80\x930.062\xc2\xa0% DW) than young leaves (0.004\xe2\x80\x930.007\xc2\xa0% DW) of the in vitro derived plantlets. The differential synthesis of CRA in micropropagated and mother plant was studied using gene expression profiles. The expression of upstream rate limiting genes in terpenoid biosynthesis was relatively high in young leaves while downstream Cytochrome P450 hydroxylase (CYP450H), catalyzing the final step(s) in CRA synthesis, was more in mature leaf, suggesting a strong correlation between observed CRA variation and gene expression. The study signifies the role of in vitro methodology for true-to-type regeneration and its possible utility for biosynthesis of CRA, throughout the year.'

Abstract: '60% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystems are not used in a sustainable way. Modern agriculture is blamed for declining soil carbon and biodiversity. Climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles impede the movement of many animal species, and distribution changes are projected to continue. Therefore, we need alternative management strategies. The colony organisation of social insects, especially of ants, is seen as a model to design an improved agricultural management, because ants are very experienced agriculturists. Ants represent half of the global insect biomass. Their individuals work like a super organism. This article focuses on harvester and leaf cutter ants by considering Lasius species. It reviews the organisation structure of social ant communities. Harvester and leaf cutter ants represent a high percentage of the worldwide ant societies. They collect plant saps with carbon nitrogen (C/N) ratios of about 40 for their own nourishment and leaf fragments with C/N ratios of about 100 for fungi gardens and brood nourishment. They sustain huge numbers of individuals with their low N-based organic imports and their colony commensalisms enable them to convert these polymers into lower molecular, partly volatile compounds, adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), and heat. Digging improves water infiltration, drainage and soil aeration. Ants maintain fungi as a food source for the scleroproteinous brood, carry out food preservation, infection control and waste management, and construct with endurance new nests and rebuild them after damage. All these activities move the nest sites far away from the thermodynamic equilibrium. Physical, chemical and biological gradients emerge and the growing populations, together with nest-penetrating mycorrhized plant roots, absorb the released nutrients and form biomass by lowering energy flows into potentially strong consumer-resource interactions or runaway consumptions. The plant material import of leaf cutter ants, rich in carbon but low in proteins, amounts to 85\xe2\x80\x93470 kg dry weight per year. It keeps the electron donor/acceptor ratio in favour of the electron donor so that denitrifiers can reduce nitrate predominantly to N2. Ants living in highly N-polluted areas bind the pollutant in the cuticle. In their low N-input environments harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants furnish the N demand of adult ants with the help of N2-fixing bacteria. The low N-input management of harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants is therefore a resourceful concept for approaching a highly productive agriculture by avoiding soil carbon decline and N2O emissions increase.'

Abstract: 'Wild edibles continue to be a significant contributor to the global food basket in much of the developing world. A consensus has now been formed that information on wild edibles is an important part of ethnobotanical knowledge and hence elucidating region-specific patterns of habitat management and consumption assists policy making with regard to natural conservation, human nutrition, and human health. Using an original data set from Gujarat, India, the present research aims to document the collective knowledge of wild edibles possessed by the local Vasava tribe, as well as the habitat usage and consumption trends of these species.'

Title: 'Water Balance Study and Irrigation Strategies for Sustainable Management of a Tropical Ethiopian Lake: A Case Study of Lake Alemaya'

Abstract: 'Lake Alemaya in the Ethiopian Highlands has historically provided the surrounding area with water for domestic use, irrigation, and livestock and has served as a local fishery tank. Increasing irrigation and domestic water use, change in the local climate and changes in the surrounding land cover are believed to be the causes of Lake Alemaya\xe2\x80\x99s demise. Expansion of major irrigated crops in particular chat (Catha Edulis), potato and vegetables and non-judicious use of irrigation water in the Lake Alemaya watershed led to presumption that irrigation is partly responsible for the withdrawal of large quantity of water from the lake. Thus, water balance study of Lake Alemaya was carried out under presumed scenarios in order to study the possible trends and fluctuations of the lake water level in response to proposed scenarios. Further, it is essential to study the irrigation performance for developing optimal irrigation schedules in the study area to make the best use of available water for long term sustainability of the water resources of Lake Alemaya. It was identified that expansion of the irrigated area in general and chat cultivation in particular in the study area have been the key to sustainable management of lake water, hence its expansion during the past 37\xc2\xa0years (1965\xe2\x80\x932002) was studied through interpretation of satellite data. Subsequently, performance evaluation of the small-scale irrigation practices for major irrigated crops was carried out. Optimal irrigation schedules for different crop seasons were also developed for these irrigated crops using CROPWAT software. It was found that chat area increased from 190\xc2\xa0ha in 1996 to nearly 330\xc2\xa0ha in 2002. Further, it was observed that 43% surface area of the lake has reduced within a span of 37\xc2\xa0years. Overall, maximum irrigation intensity of chat, potato and vegetables is observed during the first irrigation season of the crop calendar. Particularly, in case of chat, irrigation performance indicators such as Relative Water Supply (RWS), Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS), Depleted Fraction (DF) and Overall Consumed Ratio (OCR) values indicated poor performance of irrigation practices. From the analysis, it was found that the application of a fixed irrigation depth and fixed irrigation interval combinations of (25\xc2\xa0mm\xe2\x80\x9425\xc2\xa0day), (20\xc2\xa0mm\xe2\x80\x9420\xc2\xa0day), or (20\xc2\xa0mm\xe2\x80\x9425\xc2\xa0day) are recommended for chat in the study area. Optimal irrigation schedules were decided on the basis of combination of irrigation interval and depth that results in low loss of irrigation water with reasonable yield reduction. Thus, determination of appropriate water management strategy can ensure proper utilization of the available water resources and improve the water application efficiency of the small-scale irrigation practices around Lake Alemaya, Ethiopia.'

Abstract: 'Watershed characterization and prioritization is carried out before taking up the task of management. Morphometric analysis plays significant role in prioritization of watersheds for proper use and various economic activities like animal husbandry. In the present study, morphometric investigations are used to ascertain plant growth potential of watershed for environmental management. Analysis was carried out in four sub-watersheds of Shivganga\xc2\xa0watershed using\xc2\xa0Geographic information system (GIS) technique for determining plant growth potential. The analysis includes linear aspects, aerial aspects and relief aspects. Exhaustive data requirements and individual biasness for assigning weights to various morphometric parameters affect the prioritization process. Thus, Weighted Sum Analysis (WSA) method is used in the present study for identifying sub-watersheds\xc2\xa0suitable for potential plant growth. The maximum elevation in Shivganga watershed is 1264\xc2\xa0m in sub-watershed 1\xc2\xa0(SW1) which increases stream flow velocity, erosion, minimized length of overland flow and quick water flow into streams contributing to hydrograph rise. It has been observed that sub-watershed 3 and 4 with low average slope show significant plant growth and contribute less runoff, relatively less land erosion and low peaks in hydrograph. The SW3 has highest potential for plant growth as it matches with the lowest weighted sum analysis. Thus, SW1 is given rank 1 with least compound factor value 1.317. The result illustrated that 13.64 to 45.40% of total area, falls in the good potential growth zone. The results of the work may be useful for watershed administrators and managers while planning conservation measures in the area.'

Abstract: 'Tropical and subtropical hilly vegetation in Himalayan regions are well suited for the taxonomical research because of the diverse habitat available in close proximity and the regions promote high species richness and endemism due to variation in slopes, soils, rocks, microclimate, exposure, latitude and altitude. Pteridophytes have evolved to fill the ecological niche between the angiosperms and the gymnosperms. During the course of recent study towards the pteridophytes of Nokrek Biosphere Reserve in eastern Himalaya, a few new taxa are described and geographical distribution extension of several previously reported species have also come to light. Studies based mainly on collections made during the last 6\xc2\xa0 years have resulted in the revised description of the 19 species of lycophyta and ferns viz. Asplenium gueinzianum, Argostemma perakense, Asplenium sinense, Cyclosorus crinipes, Diplazium pseudosetigerum, Hymenasplenium cheilosorum, Lemmaphyllum microphyllum, , Lemmaphyllum rostratum, Loxogramme chinensis, Lygodium microphyllum, Microlepia hancei, Microlepia rhomboidia, Neocheiropteris zippelii, Pleopeltis macrosphaera, Pseudocyclosorus falcilobus, Pteris cadieri var. hainanensis, Pyrrosia lanceolata, Pyrrosia longifolia and Tectaria paradoxa from the Meghalaya state recorded for the first time. Full species citations, taxonomic notes, phenology time, chromosome counts, ecology, specimen studied, previously known distributions and citation records are given for all taxa. Recent collections show the richness of the flora of Meghalaya and permit more accurate taxonomic and phytogeographic comparisons with lycophyta and fern flora from adjacent areas.'

Abstract: 'India has reasons to be concerned about climate change. Over 650\xc2\xa0million people depend on climate-sensitive sectors, such as rain-fed agriculture and forestry, for livelihood and over 973 million people are exposed to vector borne malarial parasites. Projection of climatic factors indicates a wider exposure to malaria for the Indian population in the future. If precautionary measures are not taken and development processes are not managed properly some developmental activities, such as hydro-electric dams and irrigation canal systems, may also exacerbate breeding grounds for malaria. This article integrates climate change and developmental variables in articulating a framework for integrated impact assessment and adaptation responses, with malaria incidence in India as a case study. The climate change variables include temperature, rainfall, humidity, extreme events, and other secondary variables. Development variables are income levels, institutional mechanisms to implement preventive measures, infrastructure development that could promote malarial breeding grounds, and other policies. The case study indicates that sustainable development variables may sometimes reduce the adverse impacts on the system due to climate change alone, while it may sometimes also exacerbate these impacts if the development variables are not managed well and therefore they produce a negative impact on the system. The study concludes that well crafted and well managed developmental policies could result in enhanced resilience of communities and systems, and lower health impacts due to climate change.'

Abstract: 'We examined the effects of treefall gap size and soil properties on microbial biomass dynamics in an undisturbed mature-phase humid subtropical broadleaved forest in north-east India. Canopy gaps had low soil moisture and low microbial biomass suggesting that belowground dynamics accompanied changes in light resources after canopy opening. High rainfall in the region causes excessive erosion/leaching of top soil and eventually soil fertility declines in treefall gaps compared to understorey. Soil microbial population was less during periods when temperature and moisture conditions are low, while it peaked during rainy season when the litter decomposition rate is at its peak on the forest floor. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season (the peak vegetative growth period) limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and, therefore, low microbial C, N and P. Weak correlations were also obtained for the relationships between microbial C, N and P and soil physico\xe2\x80\x93chemical properties. Gap size did influence the microbial nutrients and their contribution to soil organic carbon, total Kjeldhal nitrogen and available-P. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic carbon, microbial N to total nitrogen were similar in both treefall gaps and understorey plots, while the contribution of microbial P to soil available-P was lower in gap compared to the understorey. These results indicate that any fluctuation in microbial biomass related nutrient cycling processes in conjunction with the associated microclimate variation may affect the pattern of regeneration of tree seedlings in the gaps and hence be related with their size.'

Abstract: 'The paper deals with the hydrochemical characterization and water quality assessment of springs emerging from the Archaean crystalline basements at the foothills of Western Ghat mountains in the highlands and Neogene sedimentary formations in the coastal lowlands of Kerala in south west India. A total of 19 springs from two important river basins of southern Kerala such as Ithikkara and Kallada river basins were studied for 18 physico-chemical (temperature, pH, electrical conductivity\xc2\xa0(EC), total dissolved solids\xc2\xa0(TDS), dissolved oxygen\xc2\xa0(DO), total hardness (TH), Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, CO3 2\xe2\x88\x92, HCO3 \xe2\x88\x92, Cl\xe2\x88\x92, SO4 2\xe2\x88\x92 , NO3 \xe2\x88\x92,\xc2\xa0SiO2, Fe2+, and F\xe2\x88\x92 ) as well as bacteriological parameters. The discharge computations show that free-falling type of springs in the area discharge about 256.23 million liters of water a year. A comparative study between the spring water samples of highland and lowland regions reveal that the quality of spring water, except pH and bacteriological contents, satisfies the standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards and World Health Organization for drinking water. Spring water samples collected from the lowlands register high value of Na+ and Cl\xe2\x88\x92 compared with the highlands. Bicarbonate, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ values are high in highland than lowland springs. The present study reveals that the spring water sources in the region can be developed as an alternate source for drinking water, provided pH correction and proper disinfection are done prior to its end use.'

Abstract: 'Hyposidra talaca (Walk.) is a major pest of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) in Northeastern (NE) India. The present study examined (1) the likely causes of expansion of H. talaca to tea from its ancestral home of sal forests, and (2) the anti-predatory mechanisms that helped it to build up in tea plantations. Studies were made on the role of the regulating agents of the eggs and caterpillars of the pest and responses of caterpillars to different predator-like stimuli (predatory wasps, ants and birds) and mechanical vibrations. Eggs collected from the fields were reared in the laboratory to study egg parasitization and monitored in the field to study the role of natural predators. Prolonged drought and inconsistent rainfall influenced the range expansion of H. talaca. In tea plantations, female moths preferred to conceal the eggs in the scaly bark of shade trees. Excluding woodpeckers, H. talaca eggs were scarcely attacked by other natural enemies.

Abstract: 'Dynamics of heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb, and Cd in surface water of Mahanadi River estuarine systems were studied taking 31 different stations and three different seasons. This study demonstrates that the elemental concentrations are extremely variable and most of them are higher than the World river average. Among the heavy metals, iron is present at highest concentration while cadmium is at the least. The spatial pattern of heavy metals suggests that their anthropogenic sources are possibly from two major fertilizer plants and municipal sewage from three major towns as well as agricultural runoff. The temporal variations for metals like Fe, Cu, and Pb exhibit higher values during the monsoon season, which are related to agricultural runoff. Concentrations of Ni, Pb, and Cd exceed the maximum permissible limits of surface water quality in some polluted stations and pose health risks. Dissolved heavy metals like Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Pb exhibit a non-conservative behavior during estuarine mixing, while Zn, Cu, and Co distribution is conservative. Distribution of cadmium in the estuarine region indicates some mobilization which may be due to desorption. The enrichment ratio data suggest that various industrial wastes and municipal wastes contribute most of the dissolved metals in the Mahanadi River. The Mahanadi River transports 18.216 \xc3\x97 103\xc2\xa0t of total heavy metals into the Bay of Bengal and the calculated rate of erosion in the basin is 128.645\xc2\xa0kg km\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x891.'

Abstract: 'Genetic uniformity is one of the most important prerequisites for successful micropropagation of crop species. Genetic fidelity of in vitro raised 40 plants of Ocimum basilicum L. derived from nodal explants was assessed by 56 RAPD and 17 ISSR markers, for their genetic stability. Out of 56 RAPD and 17 ISSR primers screened, only 31 RAPD and 11 ISSR primers produced clear, reproducible, and scorable bands. The 31 RAPD primers produced 92 distinct and scorable loci, with an average of 2.96 loci per primer. The number of scorable loci for ISSR primers varied from three (ISSR-BG09 and ISSR-BG11) to eight (ISSR-BG01), with an average of 4.81 loci per primer. The number of loci generated per primer was greater in ISSR than RAPD. The markers designed from AG motif amplified more number of loci. The markers anchored at 3\xe2\x80\x99 ends produced a higher number of consistent bands than unanchored markers. All banding profiles from micropropagated plants were monomorphic and similar to those of the mother plant. A similarity matrix based on Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s coefficient revealed that the pair-wise value between the mother and the in vitro-raised plantlets was 1, indicating 100% similarity. This confirmed the true-to-type nature of the in vitro-raised clones.'

Abstract: 'The current anthropogenic activities and climate change are increasingly becoming a growing global concern for dry tropical forests. Worldwide, these ecologically important forests have degraded considerably since the past few decades due to such factors. These factors have harmful consequences on the vegetation structure and diversity especially tree seedlings, which may further aggravate climate change. Generally, the vegetation recovery is very slow and unpredictable in the dry tropics due to complex interaction among tree seedling, site (particularly, soil) and climatic conditions. We inculcated that a better understanding of the behavior of individuals of different tree species at seedling stage in dry forests is of immense importance. It is increasingly being recognized for explaining and managing the future composition of plant communities under changing environmental conditions. In this regard, the multi-factorial interaction studies under various resource\xe2\x80\x93disturbance combinations are needed in dry tropical ecosystems to understand the: (1) impact of relative variability in resources and disturbances on the responses of tree seedlings of native species and (2) how the later relates to distinct functional and life history traits of the individual tree species. Most importantly, such studies would improve our limited understanding of how variation (natural and man-made) in nutrient availability, under the influence of other local environmental factors (such as water, light, grass competition, herbivory, fire, allelopathy and enhanced CO2 conditions), would affect the dynamics of dry tropical forest community. It may help in the proper management of these forests. Moreover, it may prove helpful in the current climate change scenario, as change in forest community dynamics may have consequences on soil C sequestration and CO2 efflux at global scale.'

Abstract: 'Agricultural drought has been a recurrent phenomenon in many parts of India. Remote sensing plays a vital role in real time monitoring of the agricultural drought conditions over large area, there by effectively supplementing the ground mechanism. Conventional drought monitoring is based on subjective data. The satellite based monitoring such as National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS) is based on the crop condition, which is an integrated effect of soil, effective rainfall, weather, etc. Drought causes changes in the external appearance of vegetation, which can clearly be identified (by their changed spectral response) and judged using satellite sensors through the use of vegetation indices. These indices are functions of rate of growth of the plants and are sensitive to the changes of moisture stress in vegetation. The satellite based drought assessment methodology was developed based on relationship obtained between previous year\xe2\x80\x99s Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles with corresponding agricultural performance available at district/block level. Palar basin, one of the major river basins in Tamil Nadu state was selected as the study area. The basin covers 3 districts, which contain 44 blocks. Wide Image Field Sensor (WiFS) of 188m spatial resolution from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) data was used for the analysis. Satellite based vegetation index NDVI, was generated for Samba and Navarai seasons in the years 1998 and 1999. An attempt has been made to estimate the area under paddy. It was also observed that, there was reduction in the crop area as well as vigour in the vegetation in both Samba and Navarai seasons in 1999 when compared with 1998. Drought severity maps were prepared in GIS environment giving blockwise agricultural water deficiency status.'

Abstract: ' Polypleurum stylosum var. laciniata of the family Podostemaceae, is an endemic aquatic angiosperm, which grows on rocks in fast flowing rivers and streams in Kerala (India). The plant body is thalloid and it lacks the conventional differentiation into root and shoot and is attached to the rocks with the help of rhizoids. Vegetative growth occurs in submerged conditions and lowering of water table triggers flowering. Flower buds appear along the thallus margin enclosed by a spathella and sustained by two or three pairs of bracts. The ovary lacks a distinct style and the stigma is characteristically bifid. There are two stamens with their filaments fused, which keep on elongating and mingle with the stigma at maturity. High pollen\xe2\x80\x93ovule and ovule\xe2\x80\x93seed ratio indicate the high probability of plant establishment. Nearly 205\xc2\xa0minute seeds are produced in a fruit. The embryo lacks plumule and radicle. In tissue culture, the seeds germinate and produce a green radical which sticks to the hard substratum by means of the epidermal outgrowths. The main thalloid plant body originates from the hypocotyl region as a bulge and grows into a prostrate branched thallus.\n'

Abstract: 'Water scarcity was caused by many factors such as increase in demand of water, decrease in water availability and poor water quality. Bharathapuzha river basin in Kerala was taken for the study as it faces acute water stress during summer months. The water stress was calculated using two indicators: the Falkenmark\xe2\x80\x99s water stress indicator (WSI) and blue water scarcity indicator based on blue water footprint (BWSI). In water stress indicator based on water footprint, three sectors: domestic, industrial and agriculture were considered. Water stress was calculated for 3 decades 1982\xe2\x80\x931991, 1992\xe2\x80\x932001 and 2002\xe2\x80\x932011. Using Falkenmark\xe2\x80\x99s WSI absolute scarcity was increased from zero to 238.8\xc2\xa0km2 and water scarcity from 874 to 1584.27\xc2\xa0km2 in the decades. However, BWSI showed severe water scarcity in 873\xc2\xa0km2 of area in all decades. This region falls on eastern side of the river basin. Comparing the results of the two indicators shows that two subbasins face severe water stress by using both the indicators. This study will help the planner to design proper water conservation measures to alleviate the water scarcity.'

Abstract: 'The deterioration of groundwater quality in Coimbatore district is principally attributed to the geological formations, application of agrochemicals and discharge of untreated industrial effluents. Groundwater samples were collected and analysed to obtain the hydrochemical characteristics for delineating the groundwater recharge and discharge zones. Alkaline water is present in the district during all seasons. Groundwater facies were evaluated and the majority of them were CaHCO3 and Ca\xe2\x80\x93Na\xe2\x80\x93HCO3 types. Generally, HCO3 was used to identify the recharge area and Cl the discharge area. Dominance of HCO3 in both water types helps in identifying the recharge zones. The TDS and major ions in conjunction with HCO3/Cl, SO4/HCO3, HCO3\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0CO3/Ca\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0Mg, HCO3\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0CO3/T.anions and Cl/T.anions were used in the delineation of recharge\xe2\x80\x93discharge areas. Results of geochemical modelling using PHREEQC were in agreement with the analysis of ionic ratios. Carbonate minerals are saturated in the recharge zone and become undersaturated as the flow progresses. HCO3 to Cl types for the recharge to discharge zones were confirmed by the aqueous speciation modelling. Gradual increase of NO3 along the flow path also supported the increasing anthropogenic influences towards the discharge zone. The spatial distribution diagrams drawn for each of these ratios suggested that a major part of the study area is covered by recharge zones. Mettupalayam and Pollachi taluks were found to be discharge zones. The results of the study showed that the water quality in the discharge zones is largely controlled by anthropogenic activities. The study gains importance since part of the water supply to the Coimbatore corporation area is from a source in the neighbouring state and the major surface water source of this area comes under an interstate water dispute.'

Abstract: 'Integrating targeted metabolic profiling with genetic diversity estimates is vital for selecting genetic stocks for breeding as well as mapping a biochemical trait. In Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., copious amount of L-Dopa in seeds is viewed both as a boon and bane. Our objective of this work was to assess in conjunction both L-Dopa and genomic diversity in a selected set of germplasm to elucidate their relationship and identify parents for L-Dopa breeding/mapping. The findings revealed good genetic as well as metabolic (L-Dopa) diversity among the studied accessions. However, we could not establish direct relationship between these two as the marker data measured using AFLP and ISSR were not correlated with the seed L-Dopa contents. Based on the consensus information from both the data sets, seven parental combinations have been suggested. These findings are expected to pave way for genetic improvement as well as genetic mapping of L-Dopa trait besides integration of molecular markers in M. pruriens breeding programs.'

Abstract: ' Coscinium fenestratum seeds with 23\xc2\xa0% initial moisture content showed 40\xc2\xa0% germination over a period of 4\xc2\xa0months incubation. On pre-treatment with GA3 3,000\xc2\xa0ppm, more than 90\xc2\xa0% of fresh seeds germinated in a month. When fresh seeds were shade dried under laboratory conditions (28\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C/60\xc2\xa0% RH) for two days, moisture content was reduced to 10\xe2\x80\x9312\xc2\xa0% along with 80\xc2\xa0% seed germination in a week. It was also observed that fresh seeds in polycarbonate bottles kept under laboratory conditions showed germination after 3\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xa0months of storage. Germination of C. fenestratum seeds can be controlled by phytohormones like GA3, IAA or ABA. When tested, GA3 and IAA excelled over ABA, in seeds with 11\xc2\xa0% moisture content as well as in 6\xc2\xa0month stored seeds.'

Abstract: 'India\xe2\x80\x99s constitution contains provisions for the \xe2\x80\x98right to work\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98right to movement\xe2\x80\x99 for all citizens. Established in 2005, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is broadly considered to operationalize this \xe2\x80\x98right to work\xe2\x80\x99. At the same time, a public discourse persists that views MGNREGA as a substitute for internal labour migration. Drawing on the results from 300 household surveys in three panchayats in the Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu, we test the validity of this discourse in this setting. We find that households that rely exclusively on MGNREGA have different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics compared to households that rely exclusively on remittances from internal labour migration. Furthermore, 20 per cent of households surveyed use both MGNREGA and internal labour migration as complementary livelihood strategies. We argue that there is\xc2\xa0a need for better understanding and recognition of the complementary potential of MGNREGA and internal labour migration.'

Abstract: 'Microscopic-coprological examination of Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus L., 1798) dung piles (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8955) in South Wayanad Forest Division from March to August, 2017 revealed 74.5% prevalence of parasites in elephants. Ancylostoma sp. Anoplocephala sp., Strongyle type egg and Strongyloides sp. were the major parasites recorded. Strongyloides sp. and Strongyle type egg were observed more frequently (58.1%). Ancylostoma sp. and Anoplocephala sp. were constituted 1.8% each; mixed parasitic species infections were recorded. The frequency distribution of parasitic load in elephants showed skewed distribution of propagules. Centrifugal sedimentation and floatation methods of fecal examination of outer and inner regions of dung did not show significant difference in number of propagules. The highest number of parasitic propagules was recorded in floatation method. The number of propagules varied among dung samples of different herds collected from different localities. There were no relation between the parasitic load and age of elephants. The mean density of parasite eggs was higher in solitary animals (214.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89155.4 epg) than herd elephants (147.78\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89111.1 epg). Though parasitic load was higher in solitary males, based on the occurrence of parasites using logistic regression it was found that females had 1.83 times higher occurrence for parasitic infection than males. Both length and width of parasite egg size classes were used to classify into different taxonomic groups using discriminate function analysis. Three distinct size clusters were identified. Nematode and Cestode eggs were classified correctly with 95.7% accuracy. Since, the egg size was similar in nematode group separation into genus was difficult. Further, inclusion of stages of development of egg and larvae enable better separation.'

Abstract: 'Rainfall induced landslides are a common threat to the communities living on dangerous hill-slopes in Chittagong Metropolitan Area, Bangladesh. Extreme population pressure, indiscriminate hill cutting, increased precipitation events due to global warming and associated unplanned urbanization in the hills are exaggerating landslide events. The aim of this article is to prepare a scientifically accurate landslide susceptibility map by combining landslide initiation and runout maps. Land cover, slope, soil permeability, surface geology, precipitation, aspect, and distance to hill cut, road cut, drainage and stream network factor maps were selected by conditional independence test. The locations of 56 landslides were collected by field surveying. A weight of evidence (WoE) method was applied to calculate the positive (presence of landslides) and negative (absence of landslides) factor weights. A combination of analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and fuzzy membership standardization (weighs from 0 to 1) was applied for performing a spatial multi-criteria evaluation. Expert opinion guided the decision rule for AHP. The Flow-R tool that allows modeling landslide runout from the initiation sources was applied. The flow direction was calculated using the modified Holmgren\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm. The AHP landslide initiation and runout susceptibility maps were used to prepare a combined landslide susceptibility map. The relative operating characteristic curve was used for model validation purpose. The accuracy of WoE, AHP, and combined susceptibility map was calculated 96%, 97%, and 98%, respectively.'

Abstract: ' Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson is a tuberous herb occurring in the wild and cultivated state. Vegetative morphological characters were studied at full foliage stage in 17 accessions of A. paeoniifolius which include two cultivars, 15 wild accessions and a related species, A. dubius Blume. The first principal component (PC) accounted for 42.32% of phenotypic variance followed by second for another 18.38%. Major traits that accounted for more variability in both PC1 and PC2 include offset shape, cormel weight per corm, corm fresh weight, petiole surface pattern and canopy spread. The unweighted pair- group method with mathematical averaging (UPGMA) clustering method revealed three principal clusters which separated all the accessions between Euclidean distances of 0.3\xe2\x80\x931.6. Both cluster analysis and principal co-ordinate analysis revealed T10, a morphotype of A. paeoniifolius var. campanulatus (Decne.) Sivad. cultivated in Tamil Nadu and P19 accession of A. paeoniifolius var. paeoniifolius from Karnataka as morphologically distinct, which needs further validation on the basis of floral characters or molecular markers and G3 from Gujarat as an immediate ancestor of cultivated elephant foot yam. The genotypic (GCV) and phenotypic (PCV) coefficients of variation, broad sense heritability (h2B) and genetic advance (GA) as a percent of the mean assessed for 18 accessions revealed high heritability estimates. A highly significant (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) correlation coefficient between circumference of petiole base and corm diameter, corm height, corm weight, east west spread and north south spread suggests that circumference of petiole and canopy spread are indicators to corm weight and size.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing data and Geographical Information System (GIS) has been integrated with the weighted index overlay (WIO) method and E 30 model for the identification and delineation of soil erosion susceptibility zones and the assessment of rate of soil erosion in the mountainous sub-watershed of River Manimala in Kerala (India). Soil erosion is identified as the one of the most serious environmental problems in the human altered mountainous environment. The reliability of estimated soil erosion susceptibility and soil loss is based on how accurately the different factors were estimated or prepared. In the present analysis, factors that are considered to be influence the soil erosion are: land use/land cover, NDVI, landform, drainage density, drainage frequency, lineament frequency, slope, and relative relief. By the WIO analysis, the area is divided into zones representing low (33.30%), moderate (33.70%), and high (33%) erosion proneness. The annual soil erosion rate of the area under investigation was calculated by carefully determining its various parameters and erosion for each of the pixels were estimated individually. The spatial pattern thus created for the area indicates that the average annual rate of soil erosion in the area was ranging from 0.04\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921 to 61.80\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0yr\xe2\x88\x921. The high soil erosion probability and maximum erosion rate was observed in areas with high terrain alteration, high relief and slopes with the intensity and duration of heavy precipitation during the monsoons.'

Abstract: 'We studied the effect of triacontanol (TRIA) on shoot multiplication and rooting of in vitro derived shoot tips of Capsicum frutescens and Decalepis hamiltonii W & A. In both shoot multiplication and rooting phases, TRIA was administered at 2-20 \xce\xbcg l\xe2\x88\x921. TRIA resulted in highest promotion of axillary shoot proliferation at 2 \xce\xbcg l\xe2\x88\x921 in Capsicum frutescens and 20 \xce\xbcg l\xe2\x88\x921 in Decalepis hamiltonii while rooting was maximum at 5 and 10 \xce\xbcg l\xe2\x88\x921 for Capsicum frutescens and Decalepis hamiltonii respectively. TRIA enhanced shoot growth and chlorophyll content of leaves and also influenced root induction and supported growth of the roots. This work reveals that TRIA can be used as an effective growth regulator in the micropropagation of Capsicum frutescens and Decalepis hamiltonii, an endangered shrub of Deccan peninsular India.'

Abstract: 'The efficiency of GIS, RS and multi-criteria tools in isolating potential groundwater (GW) zones in the Kuttiyadi River basin (KRB), Kerala, has been robustly demonstrated by analysis of relevant data. To infer geohydrological makeup and consequent behavior of the KRB in respect of GW potential, firstly, various thematic layers viz. geomorphology, geology, slope, soil, lineament density and drainage density, were created. Secondly, thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights on the Saaty\xe2\x80\x99s scale according to their relative significance for the presence and potential of GW. The assigned weights of the layers and their features were normalized using analytic network process method, and then the selected thematic maps were integrated in GIS using weighted overlay method to create the final groundwater prospect zone map. From the outcomes, the groundwater prospect zones of the KRB basin was found to be very good (166.21\xc2\xa0km2), good (92.01\xc2\xa0km2), moderate (180.33\xc2\xa0km2), poor (237.25\xc2\xa0km2), which constitute 24, 15, 26 and 35% of the study area, respectively. The GW prospect zone map was finally validated using geohydrology of area and GW level data from 43 phreatic wells in the study area. This study showed that groundwater prospect zone demarcation along with multi-criteria decision making is a powerful tool for proper utilization, planning and management of the precious groundwater resource.'

Abstract: 'Ticks are the important ectoparasites that occur on snakes and transmit rickettsiosis, anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis. A total of 62 snakes (Reticulated python, Indian Rock Python, Rat snakes and Spectacled cobra) were examined for tick infestation at Chennai Snake Park Trust (Guindy), Arignar Anna Zoological Park (Vandalur) and Rescue centre (Velachery) in Tamil Nadu from September, 2015 to June, 2016. Ticks from infested snakes were collected and were identified as Amblyomma gervaisi (previously known as Aponomma gervaisi). Overall occurrence of tick infestation on snakes was 66.13%. Highest prevalence of tick infestation was observed more on Reticulated Python (Python reticulatus, 90.91%) followed by Indian Rock Python (Python molurus, 88.89%), Spectacled cobra (Naja naja, 33.33%) and Rat snake (Ptyas mucosa, 21.05%). Highest prevalence of ticks were observed on snakes reared at Chennai Snake Park Trust, Guindy (83.33%), followed by Arignar Anna Zoological Park, Vandalur (60.00%) and low level prevalence of 37.50% on snakes at Rescue centre, Velachery. Among the system of management, the prevalence of ticks were more on captive snakes (70.37%) than the free ranging snakes (37.5%).

Abstract: 'We examined the carbon stock and rate of carbon sequestration in a tropical deciduous forest dominated by Dipterocarpus tuberculatus in Manipur, North East India. Estimation of aboveground biomass was determined by harvest method and multiplied with density of tree species. The aboveground biomass was between 18.27\xe2\x80\x9321.922\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 and the carbon stock ranged from 9.13 to 10.96\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 across forest stands. Aboveground biomass and carbon stock increased with the increase in tree girth. The rate of carbon sequestration varied from 1.4722 to 4.64136\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 among the dominant tree species in forest stands in tropical deciduous forest area. The rate of carbon sequestration depends on species composition, the density of large trees in different girth classes, and anthropogenic disturbances in the present forest ecosystem. Further work is required to identify tree species having the highest potential to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, which could lead to recommendations for tree plantations in a degraded ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'The influence of anthropogenic loading on the distribution of soft bottom benthic organisms of a tropical estuary (Cochin backwaters) was examined. The industrial activities were found to be high in the northern and central part of the estuary, where dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN\xc2\xa0> 210\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) and phosphorus (DIP > 6.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) have caused high abundance of chlorophyll a (up to 73\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x893) and accumulation of organic carbon in sediments (up to 5%). Principal component analysis distinguished three zones in the estuary. The central zone (Z1) was characterized by organic enrichment, low species diversity, and increased number of pollution tolerant species. Long-term deterioration of the estuary is indicated by an increase in the nutrients and chlorophyll a levels by sixfold during the last few decades. Flow restrictions in the lower estuary have lead to a fourfold increase in sediment organic carbon over the period of three decades. The reduced benthic diversity followed by an invasion of opportunistic polychaetes (Capitella capitata), are indicative of a stress in the estuary.'

Title: 'Analysis of forest cover change at Khadimnagar National Park, Sylhet, Bangladesh, using Landsat TM and GIS data'

Abstract: 'We mapped the forest cover of Khadimnagar National Park (KNP) of Sylhet Forest Division and estimated forest change over a period of 22 years (1988\xe2\x80\x932010) using Landsat TM images and other GIS data. Supervised classification and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image classification approaches were applied to the images to produce three cover classes, viz. dense forest, medium dense forest, and bare land. The change map was produced by differencing classified imageries of 1988 and 2010 as before image and after image, respectively, in ERDAS IMAGINE. Error matrix and kappa statistics were used to assess the accuracy of the produced maps. Overall map accuracies resulting from supervised classification of 1988 and 2010 imageries were 84.6% (Kappa 0.75) and 87.5% (Kappa 0.80), respectively. Forest cover statistics resulting from supervised classification showed that dense forest and bare land declined from 526 ha (67%) to 417 ha (59%) and 105 ha (13%) to 8 ha (1%), respectively, whereas medium dense forest increased from 155 ha (20%) to 317 ha (40%). Forest cover change statistics derived from NDVI classification showed that dense forest declined from 525 ha (67%) to 421 ha (54%) while medium dense forest increased from 253 ha (32%) to 356 ha (45%). Both supervised and NDVI classification approaches showed similar trends of forest change, i.e. decrease of dense forest and increase of medium dense forest, which indicates dense forest has been converted to medium dense forest. Area of bare land was unchanged. Illicit felling, encroachment, and settlement near forests caused the dense forest decline while short and long rotation plantations raised in various years caused the increase in area of medium dense forest. Protective measures should be undertaken to check further degradation of forest at KNP.'

Abstract: 'An in vitro protocol has been established for clonal propagation of Nothapodytes nimmoniana which is an important source of Camptothecin (CPT). Elite source was identified based on the chemical potency to accumulate the optimum level of CPT. Different types and concentrations of plant growth regulators were used to study their effect on inducing multiple shoots from the explants regenerated from embryos of N. nimmoniana. Of these, a combination of N6-benzyladenine (0.2\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (0.1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921) proved optimum for differentiating multiple shoots in 90.6\xc2\xa0% of the cultures with an average of 10.24 shoots per explant obtained within 8\xc2\xa0weeks of inoculation. Nearly, 92\xc2\xa0% of the excised in vitro shoots rooted on half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.05\xc2\xa0% activated charcoal, supplemented with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and IBA at 0.1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 each. The micropropagated plants were evaluated for their genetic fidelity by employing inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. Ten individuals, randomly chosen from a population of 145 regenerants, were compared with the donor plant. The regenerated plants were also evaluated for their chemical potency using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of CPT content. The true-to-type nature of the micropropagated plants was confirmed based on their monomorphic banding profiles with that of the mother plants using ISSR markers. Besides, HPLC evaluation of the CPT content confirmed the existence of chemical uniformity among the regenerated plants and the elite mother plant.'

Abstract: 'Trace metal concentrations in the muscle of the bivalve Villorita cyprinoides from the Cochin backwaters (southwest coast of India) were investigated during the monsoon, post-monsoon and pre-monsoon periods. The seasonal average ranges of metals (\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921, dry weight) in the bivalve were as follows: Fe (18,532.44\xe2\x80\x9328,267.05), Co (23.25\xe2\x80\x9337.58), Ni (10.56\xe2\x80\x9319.28), Cu (3.58\xe2\x80\x9311.35), Zn (48.45\xe2\x80\x93139.15), Cd (1.06\xe2\x80\x931.50) and Pb (3.05\xe2\x80\x934.35). The marginally elevated metal concentrations in bivalve muscles are probably related to high influx of metals as a result of pollution from the industries and agricultural fields with consequent increased bioavailability of metals to the bivalve. Evaluation of the risks to human health associated with consumption of the bivalves suggested that there is no health risk for moderate shellfish consumers. A regular and continuous biomonitoring program is recommended to establish V. cyprinoides as a bioindicator for assessing the effects of trace metal pollution and to identify future changes to conserve the \xe2\x80\x9chealth\xe2\x80\x9d of this fragile ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Digital elevation model (DEM) derived conventionally from topographic maps and space borne satellites will provide various evidences about the change in earth features. It is one of the most fundamental data source of topographical relief information and delineate watershed boundaries which is being widely applied in numerous hydrological studies. A significant amount of work has been done to address the limitation and uncertainties of DEM. This review article aimed to bring all-inclusive considerations of DEM, i.e., derivative DEM sensors, types, accessibility, cost, horizontal & vertical accuracy and cell resolution. Based on evaluation this study would offer a good assistance to the research community and users for the implication of DEM services in appropriate hydrological models to avoid the ambiguities of modeling.'

Abstract: 'A farmers\xe2\x80\x99 participatory survey was carried out in five different agroecosystems of Bangladesh to obtain information on the genetic diversity, consumers preferences for fruit quality and to assess the data to select potentially superior genotypes of jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.). A wide variation in morpho-agronomic characters was identified from farmers\xe2\x80\x99 information and also from laboratory analyses. Multivariate analysis of the data produced four discrete groups, represented by trees from different agroecological zones and soil types. Characteristics such as weight; length; diameter; girth of fruits; number of bulbs per fruit; percentage of pulp; percentage of rachis (core); and percentage of rind (peel) were found to be poorly correlated with environmental factors indicating that these characters may be genetically controlled. Other characters, such as seed weight, bulb weight, and brix (%) were found to be affected by environmental and genetic factors. Isozyme analysis of 50 accessions confirmed results obtained from field studies of morpho-agronomic characters. Ten potentially superior types were selected on the basis of yield, fruiting season, flesh colour, texture, sweetness, and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 preference for recommendation to producers.'

Abstract: 'Numerous examples exist worldwide of partial or complete alteration to the natural flow regime of river systems as a consequence of large scale water abstraction from upstream reaches. The effects may not be conspicuous in the case of very large rivers, but the ecosystems of smaller rivers or streams may be completely destroyed over a period of time. While restoration of the natural flow regime may not be possible, at present there is increased effort to implement restoration by regulating environmental flow. This study investigates the development of an environmental flow management model at an icon site in the small river basin of Bharathapuzha, west India. To determine optimal environmental flow regimes, a historic flow model based on data assimilated since 1978 indicated a satisfactory minimum flow depth for river ecosystem sustenance is 0.907\xc2\xa0m (28.8\xc2\xa0m3/s), a value also obtained from the hydraulic model; however, as three of the reservoirs were already operational at this time a flow depth of 0.922\xc2\xa0m is considered a more viable estimate. Analysis of daily stream flow in 1997\xe2\x80\x932006, indicated adequate flow regimes during the monsoons in June\xe2\x80\x93November, but that sections of the river dried out in December\xe2\x80\x93May with alarming water quality conditions near the river mouth. Furthermore, the preferred minimum \xe2\x80\x98dream\xe2\x80\x99 flow regime expressed by stakeholders of the region is a water depth of 1.548\xc2\xa0m, which exceeds 50\xc2\xa0% of the flood discharge in July. Water could potentially be conserved for environmental flow purposes by (1) the de-siltation of existing reservoirs or (2) reducing water spillage in the transfer between river basins. Ultimately environmental flow management of the region requires the establishment of a co-ordinated management body and the regular assimilation of water flow information from which science based decisions are made, to ensure both economic and environmental concerns are adequately addressed.'

Abstract: 'Roots and rhizosphere soils of Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth., A. mangium Wild., Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamk. C., Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. ex A. P. D., Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnn., Hevea brasiliensis (Wild. ex Juss) Muell. Arg., Swietenia macrophylla King. and Tectona grandis L. were collected from different locations of Madhupur forest area to study the biodiversity of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization and spore population. All the plants showed AM colonization. Out of eight selected plants, mycelial colonization was lowest in the roots of A. heterophyllus (22%) and the highest was in the roots of H. brasiliensis (78%). Mycelial intensity was observed poor (25%\xe2\x80\x9377%) and moderate (23%\xe2\x80\x9357%) in all plants species and abundant (11%\xe2\x80\x9340%) was in most of the plant species. Vesicular colonization was observed in five plant species. The lowest was recorded in E. camaldulensis (4%) and the highest was in H. brasiliensis (21%). Poor (24%\xe2\x80\x9356%), moderate (16%\xe2\x80\x93100%) and abundant (11%\xe2\x80\x9340%) type of vesicular intensity were observed. Arbuscular colonization was observed in three plants. The highest was in A. mangium (72%) and the lowest was in S. macrophylla (17%). Arbuscular intensity was recorded as poor (12%\xe2\x80\x9344%), moderate (22%\xe2\x80\x93100%) and abundant (4%\xe2\x80\x9347%). The highest AM fungal spore population was in A. auriculiformis (714) and the lowest was in D. sissoo (102). Five AM fungal genera were recorded. Glomus was found to be dominant. A few spores remained unidentified. Significant correlation was observed between percent colonization and spore population. The results of the present study indicate the occurrence of AM fungi and the mycotrophism of the plants of Madhupur forest area and the applicability of AM technology in the forest management of Madhupur forest.'

Abstract: ' Ophiorrhiza mungos is a herbaceous medicinal plant which contains a quinoline alkaloid, camptothecin (CPT), an anticancer compound. A high-yielding cell line, O. mungos cell line-3 (OMC3) was selected from cell suspension cultures of O. mungos using cell aggregate cloning method and established cell suspension culture. OMC3 cell suspension produced significantly high biomass (9.25\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.3\xc2\xa0g/flask fresh weight (FW)) and CPT yield (0.095\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.002\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 dry weight (DW)) compared with the original cell suspension. Inoculum size of OMC3 cell suspension culture was optimised as 14\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921. Media optimisation has shown that 5\xc2\xa0% (w/v) sucrose and an increased ammonium/nitrate concentration of 40/20\xc2\xa0mM favoured CPT production, whereas 3\xc2\xa0% (w/v) sucrose, an ammonium/nitrate concentration of 20/40\xc2\xa0mM and 1.25\xc2\xa0mM of phosphate favoured biomass accumulation. Jasmonic acid, chitin and salicylic acid was used to elicit CPT production in the original cell suspension culture and achieved significantly high CPT production with jasmonic acid (JA) elicitation. Further, OMC3 cell suspension culture was elicited with JA (50\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) and obtained 1.12\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.08\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 DW CPT and 9.52\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.4\xc2\xa0g/flask FW (190.4\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x88\x921 FW). The combination of cell line selection and elicitation has produced 18.66-fold increases in CPT production together with significantly high biomass yield. The study is helpful in the scale-up studies of O. mungos cell suspension culture in suitable bioreactor systems for the production of CPT.'

Abstract: 'We investigated the effect of forest thinning on soil nitrogen mineralization, nitrification and transformation in a Cryptomeria japonica plantation at high elevation to provide basic data for forest management. We chose four study plots for control, light, medium and heavy thinning treatment, and three sub-plots for buried bag studies at similar elevations in each treatment plot to measure the net N mineralization and nitrification rates in situ. The contents of soil inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) were similar between treatments, but all varied with season, reaching maxima in September 2003 and 2004. The seasonal maximum net Nmin rates after four treatments were 0.182, 0.246, 0.303 and 0.560 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921 in 2003, and 0.242, 0.258, 0.411 and 0.671 mg\xc2\xb7kg\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xb7d\xe2\x88\x921in 2004, respectively. These estimates are approximate with the lower annual rates of N mineralization for this region. Forest thinning can enhance net N mineralization and microbial biomass carbon. The percentage of annual rates of Nmin for different levels of forest thinning compared with the control plot were 13.4%, 59.8% and 154.2% in 2003, and 0.1%, 58.8% and 157.7% in 2004 for light, medium, and heavy thinning, respectively. These differences were related to soil moisture, temperature, precipitation, and soil and vegetation types. Well-planned multi-site comparisons, both located within Taiwan and the East-Asia region, could greatly improve our knowledge of regional patterns in nitrogen cycling.'

Abstract: 'Forty four superior jackfruit genotypes were collected from three districts of West Bengal, India based on jackfruit descriptor (2000). These genotypes were analyzed based on 19 important quantitative and 7 qualitative characters. From the analysis of genetic parameters, it could be concluded that characters like weight of fresh flakes without seed, weight of fresh flakes with seed, stalk length, fruit yield per tree, rachis diameter, rachis length, fruit length, shelf life, number of flakes per kg of fruit, flake width, number of seeds per kg of fruit, vitamin C, TSS/acid ratio and sugar/acid ratio could be used as selection criteria for development of effective and productive plant types in jackfruit. Further, these 44 genotypes were grouped into ten clusters for quantitative characters and eight for qualitative characters.'

Abstract: 'Object recognition is a challenging task in image processing and computer vision. In this paper, segmentation, feature extraction and classification methods are done for elephant recognition. Thresholding based segmentation technique is used for image segmentation and k-NN classifier is used for object recognition based on the shape features of the segmented image. Infrared elephant images are considered for experimentation. The database created by us for this type of object recognition includes elephant, bear, horse, pig, tiger, and cow and lion images. The recognition rate is calculated for performance evaluation. However, implementing such algorithms on software consumes more time as image sizes and bit depths grow larger. Hence this paper aims at hardware implementation of elephant recognition to reduce the computational time. The proposed hardware is prototyped inVirtex-4 xc4vlx25 FPGA using Xilinx System Generator (XSG) tool. The hardware/software co-simulation feature allows the input and output to be displayed on Matlab window while the processing is done through FPGA. The results indicate that when the category is elephant and if the recognition status is \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d, recognition rate is 100%. If the category is not an elephant and if the recognition status is \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d, recognition rate is still 100% also indicates, the approach is successful in elephant recognition and the computation of segmentation algorithm and shape feature extraction (area, centroid, equivdiameter) in hardware reduces the computational time of elephant recognition by 89.65% as compared to software computation.'

Abstract: 'An efficient micropropagation protocol based on multiple shoot induction and callus regeneration has been standardized in Sarcostemma brevistigma, a rare medicinal plant. The nodal cuttings were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BA (0.5\xe2\x80\x938\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) or Kn (0.5\xe2\x80\x938\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) alone or in combination with NAA (0.5\xe2\x80\x931.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM). Maximum multiple shoot induction was observed on MS medium supplemented with 4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA. On this medium, 100% cultures responded with an average number of 11.3 shoots per explant. However, the average shoot length was limited to only 0.9\xc2\xa0cm on this medium. The addition of 1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM NAA along with 4\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA gave rise to an average number of 10.9 shoots with an average shoot length of 1.8\xc2\xa0cm. Luxuriantly growing callus was obtained on MS medium supplemented with BA (5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) and 2,4-D (2\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM). The callus was subcultured on MS medium supplemented with BA (2\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) or Kn (2\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) alone or in combination with NAA (0.5\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) for shoot organogenesis. Optimum callus regeneration was obtained on MS medium supplemented with 10\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM BA and 1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM NAA. On this medium, 100% cultures responded with an average number of 13.4 shoots per culture. The shoots obtained via multiple shoot induction and organogenesis were rooted on half-strength MS medium supplemented with NAA (1\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) or IBA (1\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM). IBA was better than NAA in terms of both the percentage of cultures that responded and the average number of roots per explant. The rooted shoots were successfully transplanted to soil with 86% success. This standardized protocol will help to conserve this rare medicinal plant.'

Abstract: 'Wayanad, one of the high range districts of the southernmost state of Kerala is a biodiversity hotspot region with rich endemic flora and fauna. It is well known for a wide variety of crops including specially scented rice, spices, ornamental plants, medicinal plants, subtropical fruits and vegetables. The district has been the home for majority of tribal population in Kerala. These tribal groups consume a large variety of wild leaves endemic to the area as a regular food supplement. Widely consumed leaves include those of Alternanthera sessilis, Talinum portulacifolium, Boerhaavia diffusa, Cassia tora, Colocasia esculenta, Achyranthes bidentata, Achyranranthus aspera, Alternanthera dentata, Amaranthus spinosus, Amaranthus viridis, Cyathula prostrata and Solanum nigrum. A comparison of the nutrient content of these non-domesticated leaves with amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor), the most commonly used leafy vegetable of Kerala has been attempted. Among all the WLVs studied, C. tora L. exhibited higher protein, fiber and vitamin C content than amaranth with significantly low nitrate and oxalate content. Different macro minerals like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and micro minerals like copper, zinc, iron and manganese were also found to be higher in most of these wild leafy vegetables as compared to those of amaranth. Since the wild leaves consumed by the tribal communities are rich in various nutrients especially the micro nutrients, attempts should be taken to conserve and promote these wild leaves for their sustainable utilization and to achieve nutritional security.'

Unsaturated flow was carried out using distilled water/0.01\xc2\xa0M CaCl2 solution after applying chlorpyriphos and quinalphos at the rate of 0.04% a.i.ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 0.025% a.i.ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The study revealed the retention of residues of chlorpyriphos and quinalphos in the top 5-cm layer. Irrespective of the applied concentration of chlorpyriphos and quinalphos, the relative concentration of the pesticides in soil was similar. About 56% of the applied chemicals were dissipated in 30\xc2\xa0days of unsaturated flow. A new dissipation compound iron, tricarbonyl [N-(phenyl-2-pyridinylmethyene) benzenamine-N, N\xe2\x80\xb2], was detected in GCMS analysis of soil extract from distilled water percolated soil. The dissipation of chlorpyriphos and quinalphos was faster in 0.01\xc2\xa0M CaCl2-treated soil column. Among the pesticides analysed, the residue of quinalphos was detected in leachate.'

Abstract: 'Embelia ribes, an important vulnerable medicinal liana, was regenerated through organogenesis and embryogenesis using leaf explants. Leaf explants produced organogenic calluses on MS medium supplemented with 1.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 0.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 6-benzylaminopurine. Shoot regeneration was obtained from organogenic calluses on MS medium containing different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The frequency of shoot bud organogenesis was highest (23.9 shoots/explant) in MS medium containing 0.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 TDZ and 0.1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 IAA. The best result for induction of embryogenic callus was noticed in the combination of 2.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 TDZ and 0.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 2,4-D. This callus, maintained in the same medium, showed the highest differentiation of embryos (56.5%) after 6\xc2\xa0wk of culture. Embryos were transferred to MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of TDZ, and this facilitated conversion of embryos into plants. After 6\xc2\xa0wk of subculture, MS medium with 0.05\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 TDZ favored the highest percentage (52.2%) embryo conversion. As per the present protocol, 52.2% of the embryos underwent conversion, and a mean number of 29.5 shoots per culture was obtained. Shoots developed from both types of calluses were rooted on half-strength MS basal medium supplemented with 1.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 indole-3-butyric acid. HPLC-UV assay demonstrated the highest embelin content (5.33% w/w) in the embryogenic callus cultures. Embelin was isolated from embryogenic callus and was identified using IR and 1H NMR studies.'

Abstract: 'Sapwood density and bark thickness of Calophyllum inophyllum L. (a multipurpose durable timber species) were studied in various locations in Northern Australia and in Sri Lanka. Measurements were taken non-destructively by using core sampling and bark gauge. From each provenance, 4\xe2\x80\x9315 mature trees having girth at breast height over bark (GBHOB) at 100\xe2\x80\x93150 cm were selected on the basis of the population size. Significant (p<0.05) hemispheric and provenance variations in bark thickness were found. Variations in the bark thickness are influenced by environmental variables. Variations in sapwood density were less pronounced compared to that of bark thickness. Variations in sapwood density are likely to be governed by genotypic variations.'

Abstract: 'To analyze the relationship between the management of three forest stand plantations and soil quality in the Dimapur district of the Northeastern Himalayan region, India, three forest soil profiles, covered by different species stands, at three depths were tested for 13 physical and chemical variables. Only four of these variables (electric conductivity, bulk density exchangeable Mg and available P) were included in a minimum data set, after using a varimax rotation algorithm in a principal component analysis, and subsequently used to calculate a soil quality index (SQI). Results showed higher SQIs in the surface layers (0\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0cm depth) than in the deeper ones. Average weighed SQI varied significantly (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) through the three considered forest sites, with the lowest value at site FS3. These findings reveal that the approach used here is suitable for preliminary screening of the impact of a forestry species on soil, to aid in species selection and improve soil health for afforestation and reforestation projects.'

Abstract: 'Drainage morphometry provides quantitative description of the drainage system which is an important aspect of the characterisation of watersheds. Chalakudi River is one of the important rivers of the South India which has attracted attention of many environmental scientists recently because of the proposed Athirapally Hydel Project across the river. SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) data were used for preparing DEM (Digital Elevation Model), Aspect Map and Slope Map. Geographical Information System (GIS) was used for the evaluation of linear, areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters. The study reveals that the terrain exhibits dentritic and trellis pattern of drainage. The Chalakudi River Basin has a total area of 1,448.73\xc2\xa0km2 and is designated as seventh-order basin. The drainage density of the basin is estimated as 2.54 and the lower-order streams mostly dominate the basin. The high basin relief indicates high runoff and sediment transport. The elongation ratio of the Chalakudi Basin is estimated as 0.48 and indicates that the shape of the basin is elongated. The development of stream segments in the basin area is more or less effected by rainfall. Relief ratio indicates that the discharge capability of watershed is very high and the groundwater potential is meagre. The low value of drainage density in spite of mountainous relief indicates that the area is covered by dense vegetation and resistant rocks permeated by fractures and joints. These studies are helpful in watershed development planning and wise utilization of natural resources.'

Abstract: 'Surface water quality assessment is a basic and critical tool for informing sustainable management of water resources. The aim of this study is to evaluate the reservoir and river water quality of the Cauvery River in the vicinity of the Krishna Raja Sagar Dam, Karnataka, India. The results will assist water management in the study area for varied future demands including, irrigation, industries, and river conservation. Ecologically important parameters such as dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, and physico-chemical parameters were analyzed. The results were compared with standard permissible limits. The differences in various parameters were statistically significant (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) when comparing the upstream and downstream stretches of the river, particularly in summer. To identify a good technique for water quality assessment, all of the water quality parameters have been calculated by correlating various parameters and comparing them over two critical dry seasons. The dendrogram of the water-quality parameters clearly indicate that river water is safe for drinking, fishing, irrigation, and industrial purposes.'

Title: 'Terrain evaluation through the assessment of geomorphometric parameters using DEM and GIS: case study of two major sub-watersheds in Attapady, South India'

Abstract: 'Spatial pattern of geomorphometric parameters of two sub-watersheds in the Attapady valley, Kerala, is evaluated using the Geographical Information System. Both the aspatial and spatial morphometric and hypsometric measurements of the sub-watershed are compared. The analysis of geomorphometric parameters coupled with DEM and GIS suggests that the two sub-watersheds are structurally complex with high relief and the denuded hills are undergoing severe soil erosion. Terrain analysis enables evaluation of landform changes in the two sub-watersheds which indicate differences in the denudational history of adjoining watersheds. It is demonstrated that the domainal variations in the lithology and structural complexity are reflected in differences in the denudational history which in turn is manifested in the geomorphic parameters. The study also helps in developing functional relationships between geomorphometric parameters and hydrological variables.'

Abstract: 'Hydrologic response of a catchment with the most common expression through runoff coefficient reflects a complex response of interaction between the rainfall and catchment physical properties. In this study, an attempt has been made through the mean rainfall\xe2\x80\x93runoff polygon method to explore the impact of land use change on the mean monthly runoff coefficient estimated from 27\xc2\xa0years of the hydrology and land use records of a tropical catchment located in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Specifically, the land use and flow records are divided into three intervals: (1982\xe2\x80\x931990), (1992\xe2\x80\x932000) and (2002\xe2\x80\x932010). The mean monthly rainfall\xe2\x80\x93runoff polygon plotted is rendered to the three time intervals. The results have shown that contrasting shapes were computed which demonstrate the significant variability in the rainfall\xe2\x80\x93runoff response characteristics under the linkage of land use changes. Ample information describing the hydrological responses of the study area has been attained through the quantitative approaches. The study has concluded that the rainfall\xe2\x80\x93runoff polygon method can be used as a simple alternative method for assessing the impact of land use changes on the hydrological response.'

Abstract: 'The species of Ganoderma recorded from India as causing diseases of perennial crops are listed, and their host range and taxonomy discussed. Four new hosts of G. lucidum are also reported. A decline in productivity and the death of trees are the main economic impacts due to Ganoderma diseases, and the fungus is identified as a serious pathogen of cash crops, forest plantations and trees in natural forests in the country. Ganoderma diseases have been recorded on 144 hosts in India, the major pathogens being \tG. lucidum and G. applanatum. G. lucidum has been recorded on 91 hosts, and appears to cause the most widespread diseases. Identification has largely been made from morphological and cultural characters, and the names currently in use should therefore be treated with caution. Cultural methods of disease control are largely inefficient in minimising inoculum pressure and in reducing the disease incidence. Chemical methods in combination with soil amendments form short-term solutions for managing the disease and improving productivity. The immediate priorities for developing an efficient management system for Ganoderma diseases in India are: (1) a thorough understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of the diseases on different hosts, (2) clarifying current ambiguity in species names, (3) assessing the inter-relationships between populations of Ganoderma on different hosts and (4) developing tools for early detection of diseases in important crops.'

Abstract: 'A detailed study has been performed on the antioxidant activity of the acetone and methanol extracts of the stem bark of the plant, Shorea roxburghii. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the extracts were determined by DPPH, radical scavenging, ferric ion reducing power, hydroxyl radical, ABTS. radical scavenging and hydrogen peroxide scavenging activities. Reducing efficiency of the S. roxburghii towards silver nanoparticles has been evaluated using surface plasmon resonance and transmission electron microscope. Spherical shapes of particles with 4\xe2\x80\x9350 nm have been reported. Formation of silver nanoparticles ascertains the role of the water soluble phenolic compounds present in S. roxburghii. Both acetone and methanol extracts of S. roxburghii stem bark was found to be a potent antioxidant. This work provides a scientific support for the high antioxidant activity of this plant and thus it may find potential applications in the treatment of the diseases caused by free radical. The extract of this plant could be used as a green reducing agent for the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles.'

Abstract: 'This study assessed land cover (LC) changes in Kahramanmara\xc5\x9f (K.Mara\xc5\x9f) and its environs by using multitemporal Landsat and ASTER imagery, respectively belong to 1989, 2000 and 2004. A priori defined nine land cover classes in the classification scheme were urban and built-up, forest, sparsely vegetated areas, grassland, vegetated stream beds, unvegetated stream beds, bare areas, crop fields, and water bodies. Individual classifications were employed using the combination of both unsupervised and supervised classification methods. Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) was used to reduce spectral variation in the scenes arising from complex pattern of crop fields. Maximum Likelihood classifier was used in the LC classification of the individual images. Image pairs of consecutive dates were compared by overlaying the thematic LC maps and cross-tabulating the LC statistics. Urbanization and expansion of agriculture were the major reasons for the dramatic LC conversions. The amount of conversion from crop fields to water occurred as large as 927.67\xc2\xa0ha, accounting for 73% of the total land-to-water conversion. Conversions to agriculture have mainly been occurred from grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas as large as 1,314.95 and 1,325.84\xc2\xa0ha, respectively. Urban coverage doubled in this period as a result of 1,443.45\xc2\xa0ha of increase. Urban area increased in the second period from 2,920 to 3,526\xc2\xa0ha. Conversions to agriculture occurred at high amounts. A total of 1,075.79\xc2\xa0ha area changed from sparsely vegetated areas to crop fields. A landscape-level environmental monitoring scheme based on satellite remote sensing was proposed for effective environmental resource management.'

Abstract: 'Community Climate System Model (CCSM3), a coupled model developed by National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) containing atmosphere, ocean, sea-ice and land processes, simulation have been analysed for suitability in the Indian Monsoon region. A long control run of CCSM3 with constant forcing at every year has been done and the model climatology has been generated using 20\xc2\xa0years of simulation. Atmospheric component of the model has been able to capture the large scale phenomena, however, regional monsoon variability not fully captured by the model simulation. A suitable modification in the flux coupler and the convective parameterization process in regional scale certainly improve the atmospheric part of the climate system. Another major component of the climate model is the representation of Land Surface Processes (LSP). A successful inclusion of LSP in climate model must address the issues related to the regional scale variation of the properties of LSP. A proper understanding of land surface processes is very crucial for climate simulations using numerical models. To understand the LSP-monsoon coupling, the offline Community Land Model (CLM), taken from CCSM3 land component, simulation forced with three hourly atmospheric boundary conditions have also been analyzed and compared with the CLM version of coupled CCSM mode. The distribution of surface heat flux in CCSM coupled mode shows some discrepancies compared to the offline CLM. Both the simulation results are compared with existing climatological features and assessment to improve CCSM3 for the regional climate change studies is made.'

Abstract: 'During a 5-yr study of lion-tailed macaques in their natural habitat, we found that: 1) most births occurred from January to April (70%) and from September to December (19%), showing a bimodal pattern with a major and a minor birth peak; 2) the period of peaks remained the same over 5 yr; and 3) a similar pattern of birth peaks occurred both in groups in large forest complexes that had overlapping home ranges with other groups and in single groups that were isolated in forest fragments in the same region but with similar ecological conditions. The results suggest more of a birth seasonality than mere breeding synchronization in the wild lion-tailed macaques. We also analyzed data on births in captivity in European Zoos for 10 yr. We observed no seasonality or peaks in births, and the pattern was the same over the years. Data on rainfall suggest that resource availability in the wild habitat may not be uniform throughout the year; hence, ecological factors may play an important role in determination of birth patterns in the natural habitats of lion-tailed macaques.'

Abstract: 'Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker was used to assess diversity in germplasm collection of Mucuna species which has gained tremendous attention in the recent past due to its promising nutritional, agronomic and medicinal attributes. Twenty five accessions comprising five species, collected from seven states of India were evaluated with twelve AFLP primer combinations that generated a total of 1,612 fragments with an average of 134 fragments per primer combination. The values of polymorphic information content (PIC), marker index (MI) and the resolving power (Rp) demonstrated the utility of the primer combinations used in the present study for discriminating the Mucuna accessions. UPGMA and Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the genotypic data revealed clustering of accessions as per phenetic and genetic relationships. The Jaccard\xe2\x80\x99s similarity coefficient values suggested good variability among the M. pruriens accessions indicating their utility in breeding programs. Molecular diversity presented in this study combined with the datasets on other morphological/agronomic traits will be highly useful for selecting appropriate accessions for plant improvement through conventional as well as molecular breeding approaches and for evolving suitable conservation strategies.'

Embryogenic callus tissues raised from aseptic leaf explants were used for inducing somatic embryos under incubation of callus tissues at varying periods from 10 to 60\xc2\xa0days. It was noticed that callus tissues incubated between 30 and 50\xc2\xa0days in 0.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid were responded positively in half-strength Murashige and Skoog liquid media supplemented with 3\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 indole-3-acetic acid and started differentiation of globular structures in 15\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0days. Maximum differentiation of embryos was obtained in callus tissues incubated for 40\xc2\xa0days. Clumps of embryos at different stages got differentiated into plantlets in MS media supplemented with 6-benzyl aminopurine (0.2\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921) and indole-3-acetic acid (0.1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921) and produced an average of 47.92\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895.33 plants from 1.0 to 1.5\xc2\xa0g callus tissues. The regenerated plantlets were successfully deflasked, hardened and established in paper cups filled with coarse sand and recorded more than 90% establishment under shade net house (50% shade) condition with adequate watering. The method of plant regeneration system developed would be useful for raising large number of plants and production of bioactive compounds.'

Abstract: 'A scarcity of cultivation land calls for more intensive and productive land use in the East Usambara Mountains in NE Tanzania. Spice crops could generate cash in higher parts of the mountains, but the present cultivation methods are depleting the valuable forest resources. The trial was established at the end of 2000 to find out how the two popular cash crops, cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton.) and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.), normally grown under the natural forest, will produce in intensive agroforestry system with two multipurpose farm trees, Grevillea robusta A.Cunn. and nitrogen fixing Gliricidia sepium Jacq. Results from 6\xc2\xa0years showed that cardamom produced better with grevillea than in natural forest; 5.5 times more in the fourth year than the average in the area. The Land Equivalent Ratios for black pepper and cardamom showed that pepper intercropped with grevillea produced 3.9 times more than in monoculture whereas cardamom intercropped with grevillea and pepper produced 2.3 times more than in monoculture. Gliricidia improved the nitrogen and organic matter content of the soil over the levels found in natural forest. Soil acidity was, however, preventing the plants from using the available mineral nutrients more effectively.'

Abstract: 'Knowledge on seasonal variation of morpho-sedimentary processes of tropical beaches is essential to evaluate inter annual variations to devising best protection strategy for the coastal zone. A study was taken up to understand the seasonal changes of physical processes at the headland bound and compared with exposed beaches. The spatio-temporal morpho-sedimentary dynamics were carried out through beach profiles, sediment samples, and simulated wave climates across two complete annual cycle. The beach profile survey was carried out using RTK-GPS, wherein the GRADISTAT was used for analysing sediment samples. The seasonal wave climates were studied with the SWAN model coupled with WAVEWATCH III. Observation shows, the sediment environment at headland bound beach is strongly dominated by fine sand throughout the year, whereas the exposed beach is illustrated from fine to medium sand across seasonal scale. The seasonal change in beach morphology occurs considerably in the exposed beach than that compared to headland bound. Successively, the occurrence of shoreline retreat is shown maximum up to 20\xc2\xa0m in at the exposed beach during the monsoon. Both the locations showed strong seasonal variation in the wave energy as well as direction, whereas the nearshore wave energy at exposed beach is comparatively high with an average of 8342 J/m2 than the headland bound due to less deviation in the wave propagation. The analysis of seasonal wave pattern together with beach morpho-sedimentary processes exhibit the influence of wave conditions at the exposed beach when compared with headland bound beach and so the study implies for offset morphological changes and tailored management to protect the beaches from natural coastal hazards.'

Abstract: 'A novel protocol has been developed for inducing somatic embryogenesis from leaf cultures of Decalepis hamiltonii. Callus was obtained from leaf sections in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA)+N6-benzyladenine (BA) or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)+BA. Nodular embryogenic callus developed from the cut end of explants on media containing 2,4-D and BA, whereas compact callus developed on media containing NAA and BA. Upon subsequent transfer of explants with primary callus onto MS media containing zeatin and/or gibberellic acid (GA3) and BA, treatment with zeatin (13.68\xce\xbcM) and BA (10.65 \xce\xbcM) resulted in the induction of the highest number of somatic embryos directly from nodular tissue. The maturation of embryos took place along with the induction on the same medium. Embryogenic calluses with somatic embryos were subcultured onto MS basal medium supplemented with 4.56\xce\xbcM zeatin+10.65 \xce\xbcM BA. After 4wk, more extensive differentiation of somatic embryos was observed. The mature embryos developed into complete plantlets on growth regulator-free MS medium. A distinct feature of this study is the induction of somatic embryogenesis from leaf explants of Decalepis hamiltonii, which has not been reported previously. By using this protocol, complete plantlets could be regenerated through indirect somatic embryogenesis or organogenesis from leaf explants in 12\xe2\x80\x9316 wk.'

Abstract: 'The nuclides, 228Ra and 226Ra, distributed into the soluble, suspended and sediment fractions in the river have differential inputs, both fluvial and technological. The high background contribution, enhancement due to industrial activities, and changes at the backwaters are highlighted. The solubilization-precipitation cycle at the backwater is discussed in relation to the seasonal inputs of fresh and saline waters, respectively, into the estuary. Sediment shift and subsequent solubilization of Ra from sediments during monsoon are the major geological phenomena responsible for its transport from the river to the coastal marine environment.'

Abstract: 'This study involves generation and logical integration of non-spatial and spatial data in a geographical information system framework to address the gap in national level soil organic carbon estimates. Remote sensing derived inputs and other spatial layers are corrected and integrated using same geographical standards. A relational data base of soil organic carbon density of Indian forest was prepared with attribute information. Hierarchical approach was followed to stratify and verify each sample from the data base using the corrected input layers in GIS and the resulting spatially distributed data is called Indian forest soil organic carbon database. The estimated mean soil organic carbon density for Indian forest is 70\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 and varied from 35.4\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Tropical thorn forest to 104.2\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in Himalayan moist temperate forest in the upper 30\xc2\xa0cm of soil depth. Due to large variations in the surface layers the estimated standard error ranged from \xc2\xb11.5 to 15\xc2\xa0% for the upper 30\xc2\xa0cm layer which is generally higher than the bottom soil layers. The level of detail in the data base helps to establish base line information for global, national and regional level studies.'

Abstract: 'Palaeoclimate and palaeoecological study was carried out using palynological and thecamoebian evidences buried in \xe2\x88\xbc4 m vertically exposed sediment section (12 km inland from the present shoreline) of Late Holocene age along the banks of Gautami-Godavari River and from three shallow cores from its Nilarevu tributary, Andhra Pradesh. Inferred climatic periods include (1) a basal cold/arid period (\xe2\x88\xbc3000-2000 yrs BP) with dominance of Botryococcus and other fresh water algal remains coupled with abundance of 25 species of thecamoebians indicating shallow and lentic ecosystem during most of the period and (2) a relatively warm/wet conditions (since \xe2\x88\xbc2000 yrs BP) reveal lotic fresh water ecosystem characterized by the evidences of tree palynotaxa and low percentage of thecamoebians. The three shallow cores (0.5\xe2\x80\x931 m) near the mouth (\xe2\x88\xbc8 km stretch) of the Nilarevu tributary reveal fluvio-marine deposition in the top 50\xe2\x80\x9380 cm sediment unlike the deeper fresh water depositional environment suggesting sea water ingression in the recent decades. The study illustrates that the Gautami-Godavari River delta gradually prograded since \xe2\x88\xbc3000 yrs BP until 100\xe2\x80\x93150 yrs unlike the intermittent relative sea level rise and fall recorded during the same period in the contemporary south-east deltaic areas.'

Abstract: ' Helicteres isora is a medicinal plant effective against asthma, diabetes, hypolipidemia, HIV, polio besides a good source of diosgenin. Seed dormancy and low natural fruit production rate make this plant a perfect candidate for developing an in vitro regeneration method. However, to date, no such work has been procured in this plant. An efficient method for plant regeneration via shoot organogenesis from callus cultures has been developed using nodal explants in H. isora. Murashige and Skoog (MS) media counting 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, 2.26 to 13.57 \xce\xbcM), Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 2.85 to 17.13 \xce\xbcM), Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA, 2.46 to 14.70 \xce\xbcM), 6-Benzylaminopurine (BA, 2.22 to 13.32 \xce\xbcM) and Kinetin (Kin, 2.32 to 13.92 \xce\xbcM) either singly or in the following combinations (IAA + BA; IAA + Kin, and BA + Kin) produced granular callus except BA + Kin which resulted in compact, hard, greenish-white (CHGW) callus. The optimum CHGW callus (2.62\xc2\xa0g fresh weight/ explant) was produced on MS media with 13.32 \xce\xbcM BA + 2.32 \xce\xbcM Kin with over 93% callus induction frequency. Optimum shoot organogenesis (67% frequency) was achieved in CHGW callus with lower level of BA (2.22 \xce\xbcM) and Kin (2.32 \xce\xbcM) and produced 3.2 shoots/0.5\xc2\xa0g callus within 35\xc2\xa0d of culture. Microshoots were rooted successfully (62% frequency) after 35\xc2\xa0d of culture on 1/2MS containing 4.90 \xce\xbcM IBA and hardened off. Antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and biochemical parameters viz. hydrogen peroxide, reducing and nonreducing sugars, starch, proteins, phenols, and proline contents were studied in regenerating and nonregenerating CHGW calluses to establish a correlation between these parameters and shoot morphogenesis. All the enzyme activities and biochemical parameters were found more in regenerating callus than in nonregenerating except phenols.'

Abstract: 'The present study was conducted on the floristic composition, structure, diversity and biomass of understorey vegetation in the dry tropical forest of Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR) of India using phyto-sociological analysis in each forest type by randomly laying ten sample plots of 1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x891\xc2\xa0m size. The herbs were enumerated for their girth and height in sampling plots. The structure, diversity and biomass of herb communities were analyzed at forest type level and the study found 2919 plant individuals belonging to 66 species, 62 genera and 31 families. The most important family as determined by the Family Importance Value (FIV) was Poaceae in herbs layer. In terms of Importance Value Index (IVI), the herb Arthraxon hispidus (Poaceae) was the most vital species in the herbaceous community. The present study revealed that the density of herbaceous community ranged from 0.40 to 244.80\xc2\xa0herbs\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921 in various forest types, Basal area was recorded highest in Sal mixed forest (0.00373\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) and lowest was found in Bamboo forest (0.00188\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). The number of species in different forests varied from 14 to 32. Similarly, the Shannon index values in different forest types varied from 2.18 to 3.64, Simpson index values ranged from 0.045 to 0.17, the values of species richness from 16.69 to 30.52 and species evenness ranged from 0.81 to 0.95 in herb vegetation of different forest types. Shannon index values recorded in Sal mixed forest and Bamboo forest were found to be minimum. In contrary, Bamboo forest recorded maximum dominance of species as compared to other forests. Interestingly, beta diversity values ranged from 3.12 to 7.36 and it was observed to be highest in Bamboo forest and lowest in Sal mixed forest. However, the total herbaceous biomass varied from 86.28\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 to 321\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922. The study recommends adopting intensive conservation measures especially in the open mixed forest and immature Teak plantations. In addition to it, encouraging and improving sal regeneration in sal mixed forests will not only help in reducing the biotic pressure but also in restoring and conserving the fragile dry tropical forest ecosystems of India.'

Abstract: 'In this study Malaprabha sub-basin is selected for evaluation of water resource in the basin, as there is decline in flow due to reduced rainfall over years and also due to increased activities in the upstream areas of the catchment. The study focused on evaluation of hydrological components for Malaprabha sub-basin using hydrological model known as soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The model was implemented for Malaprabha sub-basin using digital elevation model (DEM), land use, soil and meteorological data etc. The model performance was evaluated by calibration and validation approach. The calibration and validation of the model was done by using the data for a period from 1991\xe2\x80\x932000. It is found that R2 and NSE values are 0.67 and 0.69 during calibration and 0.73 and 0.60 during validation. The both coefficients are satisfying the model results and are used for evaluating the hydrological components for the basin. Finally, the spatial distribution maps were prepared for Malaprabha sub-basin for different hydrological components like water yield, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, sediment yield and discharge. The results can be used for decision making purpose and further for planning of water harvesting structure.'

Abstract: 'Camptothecin is an important molecule in the synthesis of some of major anticancer agents such as irinotecan and topotecan. Traditional sources of camptothecin are mainly woody plants, some of which are being overexploited to a level that threatens the existence of the respective species. Alternate sources are being identified. In the current study, a tissue culture protocol was developed for the mass multiplication of Ophiorrhiza prostrata, an herbaceous camptothecin-containing plant, using seed explants, in order to evaluate its potential as an alternate source of commercial camptothecin. The germination of seeds was standardized on half-strength solid basal MS medium (94.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.65% success rate). Seedlings subcultured on half-strength MS agar medium supplemented with 1.5\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 benzylaminopurine (BAP) produced the most shoots (28.0\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.58) from the nodal region of a single seedling. Mass multiplication of in vitro shoots was achieved by subculturing a single shoot as well as shoot clumps. Subculturing shoot clumps containing a minimum of 4\xe2\x80\x936 shoots yielded fewer shoots per node (32.2\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.03) than when single shoots were subcultured (25.0\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.0). Shoot elongation was achieved on half-strength MS basal medium in a period of 2\xe2\x80\x933\xc2\xa0weeks. Various concentrations of auxins were tested for rooting, and 1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921 NAA gave the highest number of roots (44.0\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x894.13). Rooted shoots were successfully established under field conditions. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) was employed to measure the camptothecin levels in wild-grown plants (1.46\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.02\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 dry wt), in-vitro-regenerated plants (1.10\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.02\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 dry wt), and in-vitro-derived hardened plants (1.83\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.02\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g\xc2\xa0g\xe2\x88\x921 dry wt). The results of this study indicate that in vitro methods could be a potential path to the rapid expansion of plant biomass, which could serve as a potential source of commercial camptothecin.'

Abstract: 'The sustainable livelihood framework is a widely used approach to analyze changes in rural livelihoods, especially in resource dependent communities. The framework emphasizes that given a certain situation where the livelihood context, resources and institutions remain favourable, livelihood strategies carried out by people could possibly lead to two different outcomes. One, the results of livelihood strategies will produce sustainable outcomes providing affected households respite from the impacts of livelihood loss. Two, there is a possibility that resulting outcomes may not be sufficient to reverse livelihood crisis and may not necessarily result in sustainable livelihood because of the complexities, uncertainties and multilevel drivers associated with it. This paper aims to evaluate both these possibilities through use of empirical data to clarify factors and conditions that may impede sustainable livelihood outcomes despite well planned strategies. It highlights that availability of more resources (or capitals) do not necessarily contribute to more robust livelihood strategies or outcomes. Using the case of small scale fishery-based livelihood system of Chilika Lagoon, Bay of Bengal in the East coast of India, this paper suggests that the relationship between livelihood shocks and stresses, capitals, institutions and livelihood strategies is circular and not linear.'

Abstract: 'Delta regions of the Cauvery River basin are one of the significant areas of rice production in India. In spite of large-scale utilization of the river basin for irrigation and drinking purposes, the lack of appropriate water management has seemingly deteriorated the water quality due to increasing anthropogenic activities. To assess the extent of deterioration, physicochemical characteristics of surface water were analyzed monthly in select regions of Cauvery Delta River basin, India, during July 2007 to December 2007. Total dissolved solids, chemical oxygen demand, and phosphate recorded maximum levels of 1,638, 96, and 0.43\xc2\xa0mg/l, respectively, exceeding the permissible levels at certain sampling stations. Monsoonal rains in Cauvery River basin and the subsequent increase in river flow rate influences certain parameters like dissolved solids, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen. Agricultural runoff from watershed, sewage, and industrial effluents are suspected as probable factors of water pollution.'

Abstract: "Chilka lake, the largest coastal lagoon of Asia is one of the most dynamic ecosystems along the Indian coast. Historically the lagoon has undergone a considerable reduction in surface area due, in part, to input from natural processes but mostly due to human activities. The purpose of this investigation is to document the heavy metals' affinity for specific geochemical phases in the recently deposited sediments in the lagoon. Thirty-three samples were collected and analyzed for different geochemical phases of Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn utilizing a sequential extraction scheme. In the nonlithogenous fraction, the exchangeable fraction was not geochemically significant, having <2% of the total metal concentration for all the elements. However, the carbonate fraction contained the following percentages of the total concentration: <1% Fe, 13% Mn, 6% Cu, 4% Cr, 8% Ni, 13% Pb, and 12% Zn, suggesting the detrital origin of the sediments. Reducible and organic matter-bound fractions were the significant phases in the nonlithogenous fraction, containing 9% Fe, 16% Mn, 15% Cu, 16% Cr, 16% Ni, 14% Pb, and 14% Zn in the former and 4% Fe, 3% Mn, 17% Cu, 3% Cr, 14% Ni, 15% Pb, and 14% Zn in the latter. The phenomenon has been attributed to the scavenging affinity of Fe-Mn oxides and affinity for sorption into organic matter of the lagoon sediments. The lithogenous, residual fraction generally considered as a guide for natural background values was determined to contain 87% Fe, 67% Mn, 61% Cu, 77% Cr, 61.3% Ni, 56% Pb, and 60% Zn of the total concentrations."

Abstract: 'The ancient civilizations in India, China, Egypt and Mesopotamia have flourished due to large rivers that provided water for agriculture over millennia. Egypt was able to grow well because of the Nile. Similarly, Mesopotamia had two rivers namely the Tigris and the Euphrates. Likewise, India and China have several great rivers that continue to support the agrarian culture. This article discusses the sacred significance of rivers in the ancient and contemporary Indian culture with examples from popular Hindu scriptures. It also presents the ancient model of an eco-friendly check dam and its modern application with potential to mitigate future water-related problems across the drylands of India and elsewhere.'

Abstract: 'The concentrations of 27 major and trace elements are determined in surface water samples collected from 48 sites of diverse waterways in four states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Telangana) of South India. The aims of this study are to identify the element distribution, comparatively assess the pollution risk, and evaluate human health risks related to diverse waterways in the study area. The results indicate that elements such as Cr, Se, As, Fe, and Mn are the major pollutants, as their concentrations exceeded the acceptable national and international water quality standards in several sites of Ennore, Adyar, Cooum, Periyar, and Vrishabhavathi rivers. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals that the Ennore, Adyar, Cooum, Periyar, and Kaveri river basins are affected by various anthropogenic activities, leading to moderate-to-high pollution by As, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Se. Potential pollution sources are industrial waste, sewage intrusion, paint industry waste, and automobile runoff. Overall, the investigated sites are categorized into three major groups: highly, moderately, and least polluted. Risk on human health by metals is then evaluated using hazard quotients (HQs) and carcinogenic risk evaluation; the results indicated that As with HQ >1 is the most hazardous pollutant, which could lead to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic concerns, particularly in children. This study helps in establishing pollutant loading reduction goal and the total maximum daily loads and consequently contributes to preserving public health and developing water conservation strategies.'

Title: 'Impact of the LMDZ atmospheric grid configuration on the climate and sensitivity of the IPSL-CM5A coupled model'

Abstract: 'The IPSL-CM5A climate model was used to perform a large number of control, historical and climate change simulations in the frame of CMIP5. The refined horizontal and vertical grid of the atmospheric component, LMDZ, constitutes a major difference compared to the previous IPSL-CM4 version used for CMIP3. From imposed-SST (Sea Surface Temperature) and coupled numerical experiments, we systematically analyze the impact of the horizontal and vertical grid resolution on the simulated climate. The refinement of the horizontal grid results in a systematic reduction of major biases in the mean tropospheric structures and SST. The mid-latitude jets, located too close to the equator with the coarsest grids, move poleward. This robust feature, is accompanied by a drying at mid-latitudes and a reduction of cold biases in mid-latitudes relative to the equator. The model was also extended to the stratosphere by increasing the number of layers on the vertical from 19 to 39 (15 in the stratosphere) and adding relevant parameterizations. The 39-layer version captures the dominant modes of the stratospheric variability and exhibits stratospheric sudden warmings. Changing either the vertical or horizontal resolution modifies the global energy balance in imposed-SST simulations by typically several W/m2 which translates in the coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations into a different global-mean SST. The sensitivity is of about 1.2\xc2\xa0K per 1\xc2\xa0W/m2 when varying the horizontal grid. A re-tuning of model parameters was thus required to restore this energy balance in the imposed-SST simulations and reduce the biases in the simulated mean surface temperature and, to some extent, latitudinal SST variations in the coupled experiments for the modern climate. The tuning hardly compensates, however, for robust biases of the coupled model. Despite the wide range of grid configurations explored and their significant impact on the present-day climate, the climate sensitivity remains essentially unchanged.'

Abstract: 'It is generally perceived that landscape patterns or textures in a given protected area are spatially stationary. The findings of this study suggest that this common perception is only partially correct. Over the course of 52\xc2\xa0years, equilibrium in landscape shifting was detected using digital data for the Lassen Volcanic National Park (USA). Vertical aerial photographs taken of the park in 1941 were geo-referenced with the digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) images of the same area from 1993 to identify landscape compositions and to measure change. Spatial analysis was used to observe pattern changes over time. The results suggested that landscape development maintained equilibrium while patches were in various stages of a successional sequence. The total area of each landscape component held steady, although over time patches throughout the landscape changed\xe2\x80\x94a shifting-mosaic steady state (SMSS). These findings reflect the limitations of contemporary environmental conservation theory.

Abstract: 'Birth rate and immature survival rate in group living primates have been predicted to vary as a function of group size. These predictions were tested with data from a wild population of lion-tailed macaques in the Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu (India). Group size and composition, births, and mortality were monitored from eight groups for one to six years. The rate of growth of groups, birth rate, and survival rate were examined in relation to group size. The rate of growth of a group was a decreasing function of group size. Birth rate was also a decreasing function of group size and the number of adult females in the group. The sample size for survival rate of adults was too small to test for their dependence on group size. Immature survival was independent of group size, but the analysis was based on a very small sample. It is possible that the nature of dependence of net growth rate, birth rate, and survival rate on group size could be different outside the range of group sizes on which the analysis was based. The stronger relationship between birth rate and group size in the lion-tailed macaque, in relation to other primates, might be the result of its low birth rate as well as the relatively low temporal variation in resources in the rain forest. Limited data available from other sites indicate that the observed relationship between birth rate and group size might be spatially stable.'

BM1 fortified with CW (BM1\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0CW) showed the highest germination (80.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.1\xc2\xa0%) after 60\xc2\xa0days of inoculation, which was further improved to 91.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.9\xc2\xa0% upon incorporation of 1\xc2\xa0mg/L each of \xce\xb1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and eventually 50.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.1\xc2\xa0% cultures developed into seedlings. BM1\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0CW nourished with 2.5\xc2\xa0mg/L BAP and 1.5\xc2\xa0mg/L Kin (kinetin) proved best for multiple shoot induction from seedlings. Shoot numbers further increased with each successive transfer onto the same medium. Sixty shoots per shoot clump were achieved after four cycles of 30\xc2\xa0days each. Microshoots were rooted (81.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.4\xc2\xa0%) on MS containing 2.0\xc2\xa0mg/L indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 200\xc2\xa0mg/L activated charcoal. Rooted plantlets were gradually acclimatized to greenhouse (70\xc2\xa0% survival) and they exhibited normal morphology and growth characteristics. Flow-cytometry based DNA content analysis revealed that the ploidy levels were maintained in in-vitropropagated plants.'

Abstract: 'Anuran diversity study was conducted for one\xc2\xa0year between June 2008 and August 2009 at Durgapur, an industrial city of West Bengal, India. Nine species under four families of the Order Anura were found to occur in Durgapur. They have a wide range of habitat preference like permanent or temporary aquatic bodies, human residential area, forested areas, termite nest, tree hole, under spaces of logs and so forth. Of the nine sp. 8 were confined to Amarabati pond (site-I), 5 were confined to Durgapur Government College campus (site-II) and 7 were confined at Fuljhore (site-III) of Durgapur. Analysis of the collected data on the anuran community of the study area revealed Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener species diversity index minimum (1.312) at site-II and maximum (1.938) at site-III. In contrast Margalef richness index value was minimum (0.627) at site-II and maximum (1.424) at site-III.'

Abstract: 'Teak (Tectona grandis L. f.) is a tropical forest tree species naturally occurring in India, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. The closely related dahat (Tectona hamiltoniana Wall.) is an endemic tree species confined to Myanmar. Two chloroplast Simple Sequence Repeat (cpSSR) and sixty-nine Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers were applied to assess patterns of genetic variation in four T. grandis and three T. hamiltoniana populations in Myanmar. The cpSSR analysis confirmed a clear genetic differentiation between species, revealing a single haplotype (H1) in T. grandis, while the three T. hamiltoniana populations were fixed on different haplotypes (H2 or H3). AFLP analysis revealed that genetic diversity varied between species, showing a slightly higher variation in T. grandis than in T. hamiltoniana. The T. hamiltoniana populations showed similar levels of genetic variation, while parameters varied considerably in T. grandis populations. Analyses of Molecular Variance revealed significant genetic differentiation between the two species (38.4\xc2\xa0%, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) and among populations within species. Genetic variation mainly resided within populations. Significant pairwise genetic differentiation (pairwise F  ST ) was detected between most populations (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). An Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean dendrogram based on Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic distances revealed a clear genetic differentiation between species. Diagnostic AFLP markers with complete or nearly complete differentiation between species and complete differentiation at cpDNA markers indicated strong phylogenetic divergence between teak and dahat.'

Abstract: '\nMumbai city, the economical capital of India, is located on the west coast of stable intra-plate continental region of Peninsular India which has an experience of significant historical earthquakes in the past. The city stood as the fourth most populous city in the world. Recent seismo-tectonic studies of this city highlighted the presence of active West coast fault and Chiplun fault beneath the Deccan basalt. In the present study, spatial variability of probabilistic seismic hazard for Mumbai region (latitudes of 18.85\xe2\x80\x9319.35\xc2\xb0N and longitudes of 72.80\xe2\x80\x9373.15\xc2\xb0E at a grid spacing of 0.05\xc2\xb0) which includes Mumbai city, Suburban, part of Thane district and Navi Mumbai, in terms of ground motion parameters; peak horizontal acceleration and spectral acceleration at 1.0-s period for 2 and 10\xc2\xa0% probability of exceedance in 50\xc2\xa0years are generated. The epistemic uncertainty in hazard estimation is accounted by employing seven different ground motion prediction equations developed for worldwide shallow crustal intra-plate environments. Further, the seismic hazard results are deaggregated for Mumbai (latitude 18.94\xc2\xb0N, longitude 72.84\xc2\xb0E) to understand the relative contributions of earthquake sources in terms of magnitude and distance. The generated hazard maps are compared with the zoning specified by Indian seismic code (IS1893: Part 1 in Indian standard criteria for earthquake-resistant design of structures, Part 1\xe2\x80\x94General provisions and buildings. Bureau of Indian Standards, New Delhi, India, 2002) for rocky site. Present results show an underestimation of potential seismic hazard in the entire study region by non-probabilistic zoning prescribed by IS1893: Part 1 with significantly higher seismic hazard values in the southern part of Navi Mumbai.'

Abstract: 'The present study indicates that coastal geomorphology is controlled by the natural processes and anthropogenic activities. The changes in shoreline positions of Udupi coast, western India, are investigated for a period of 98\xc2\xa0years using multi-dated satellite images and topographic maps. The study area has been divided into four littoral cells and each cell into a number of transects at uniform intervals. Further, past shoreline positions have been demarcated and future positions are estimated for 12 and 22\xc2\xa0years. The shoreline change rate has been estimated using statistical methods\xe2\x80\x94end point rate, average of rates and linear regression\xe2\x80\x94and cross-validated with correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error (RMSE) methods. Resultant changes from natural processes and human interventions have been inferred from the estimated values of the back-calculated errors. About 53\xc2\xa0% of transects exhibit \xc2\xb110\xc2\xa0m RMSE values, indicating better agreement between the estimated and satellite-based shoreline positions, and the transects closer to the cell boundaries exhibit ~57\xc2\xa0% uncertainties in shoreline change rate estimations. Based on the values of correlation coefficient and RMSE, the influence of natural processes and human interventions on shoreline changes have been calculated. The cells/transects dominated by natural processes record low RMSE values, whereas those influenced by human interventions show lower correlation coefficient and higher RMSE values. The present study manifests that the results of this study can be very useful in quantifying shoreline changes and in prediction of shoreline positions.'

Abstract: 'Fluoride contamination in the groundwater has got great attention in last few decades due to their toxicity, persistent capacity and accumulation in human bodies. There are several sources of fluoride in the environment and different pathways to enter in the drinking water resources, which is responsible for potential effect on human health. Presence of high concentration of fluoride ion in groundwater is a major issue and it makes the water unsuitable for drinking purpose. Availability of fluoride in groundwater indicates various geochemical processes and subsurface contamination of a particular area. Fluoride-bearing aquifers, geological factors, rate of weathering, ion-exchange reaction, residence time and leaching of subsurface contaminants are major responsible factors for availability of fluoride in groundwater. In India, several studies have reported that the groundwater of several states are contaminated with high fluoride. The undesirable level of fluoride in groundwater is one of the most natural groundwater quality problem, which affects large portion of arid and semiarid regions of India. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and West Bengal are the relatively high-fluoride-contaminated states in India. Chronic ingestion of high doses of fluoride-rich water leads to fluorosis on human and animal. Over 66 million Indian populations are at risk due to excess fluoride-contaminated water. Therefore, groundwater contamination subject to undesirable level of fluoride needs urgent attention to understand the role of geochemistry, hydrogeology and climatic factors along with anthropogenic inputs in fluoride pollution.'

Abstract: 'Bacterial diversity of soil samples collected from different geographical regions of Himalayan mountains was studied through culturable (13 samples) and culture-independent approaches (5 samples based on abundance of diversity indices in each ecological niche).

Based on morphology and pigmentation, 406 isolates were selected by culturing in different cultivable media at various strengths and concentrations. All the strains were subjected to amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and the representative isolates from each cluster were chosen for 16S rRNA gene sequence-based identification. Soil habitat in Himalayan foot hills was dominated by the genera Arthrobacter, Exiguobacterium, Bacillus, Cedecea, Erwinia, and Pseudomonas. Five 16S rRNA gene libraries from the selected five samples yielded 268 clones and were grouped into 53 phylotypes covering 25 genera including the genus of Ferribacterium, Rothia, and Wautersiella, which were reported for the first time in Himalayan tracks. Principal coordinates analysis indicates that all the clone libraries were clearly separated and found to be significantly different from each other. Further, extracellular investigation of cold-active enzymes showed activity of cellulase (23.71\xc2\xa0%), pectinase (20.24\xc2\xa0%), amylase (17.32\xc2\xa0%), phytase (13.87\xc2\xa0%), protease (12.72\xc2\xa0%), and lipase (23.71\xc2\xa0%) among the isolates. Four isolates namely Exiguobacterium mexicanum (BSa14), Exiguobacterium sibiricum (BZa11), Micrococcus antarcticus (BSb10), and Bacillus simplex (BZb3) showed multiple enzyme activity for five different types of enzymes. In addition, various genera like Exiguobacterium, Erwinia, Mycetecola, Cedecea, Pantoea, and Trichococcus have also shown novel hydrolytic enzyme activity in the Himalayan foothills.'

Title: 'Framework for mapping the drivers of coastal vulnerability and spatial decision making for climate-change adaptation: A case study from Maharashtra, India'

Abstract: 'The impacts of climate change are of particular concern to the coastal region of tropical countries like India, which are exposed to cyclones, floods, tsunami, seawater intrusion, etc. Climate-change adaptation presupposes comprehensive assessment of vulnerability status. Studies so far relied either on remote sensing-based spatial mapping of physical vulnerability or on certain socio-economic aspects with limited scope for upscaling or replication. The current study is an attempt to develop a holistic and robust framework to assess the vulnerability of coastal India at different levels. We propose and estimate cumulative vulnerability index (CVI) as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, at the village level, using nationally comparable and credible datasets. The exposure index (EI) was determined at the village level by decomposing the spatial multi-hazard maps, while sensitivity (SI) and adaptive capacity indices (ACI) were estimated using 23 indicators, covering social and economic aspects. The indicators were identified through the literature review, expert consultations, opinion survey, and were further validated through statistical tests. The socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was constructed as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for planning grassroot-level interventions and adaptation strategies. The framework was piloted in Sindhudurg, a coastal district in Maharashtra, India. It comprises 317 villages, spread across three taluks viz., Devgad, Malvan and Vengurla. The villages in Sindhudurg were ranked based on this multi-criteria approach. Based on CVI values, 92 villages (30%) in Sindhudurg were identified as highly vulnerable. We propose a decision tool for identifying villages vulnerable to changing climate, based on their level of sensitivity and adaptive capacity in a two-dimensional matrix, thus aiding in planning location-specific interventions. Here, vulnerability indicators are classified and designated as \xe2\x80\x98drivers\xe2\x80\x99 (indicators with significantly high values and intervention priority) and \xe2\x80\x98buffers\xe2\x80\x99 (indicators with low-to-moderate values) at the village level. The framework provides for aggregation or decomposition of CVI and other sub-indices, in order to plan spatial contingency plans and enable swift action for climate adaptation.'

Abstract: 'The present investigation reports optimized parameters for somatic embryogenesis and cryopreservation of embryogenic cultures using shoot apical domes from mature trees of Pinus roxburghii Sarg. Embryogenic tissue of P. roxburghii Sarg. was cryopreserved for 24 h, 10 d, and 8 wk using sorbitol and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as cryoprotectants. Results indicate that 0.2M sorbitol and 5% DMSO had the best cryoprotecting effect. The recovered tissue showed luxuriant growth on maintenance medium (II). Partial desiccation of thawed embryogenic tissue for 24 h prior to transfer to maturation medium enhanced the maturation of somatic embryos. Maturation frequency increased from 1.3 to 18.3% after 12 h desiccation treatment, and from 18.3 to 61.8% after 24 h of desiccation. However, non-desiccated embryogenic tissue produced the least number of somatic embryos (1.3%) on the maturation medium with the same abscisic acid and Gellan gum concentration. All the three embryogenic lines produced plantlets and had the same appearance and normal growth as compared to unfrozen controls.'

Abstract: 'In this study an attempt has been made to examine the evolutionary features of the dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of the marine atmosphere over the South-East Arabian Sea near 9.22\xc2\xb0N, 74.51\xc2\xb0E just two to three days prior to the onset of southwest monsoon over Kerala during 2003 and seek the linkages with the large-scale flow in the lower and middle troposphere at that time over the region. The marine meteorological data collected onboard ORV Sagarkanya as part of the experiment ARMEX-2003 for 4\xe2\x80\x938 June, 2003 are used. The monsoon onset over Kerala occurred on 8 June, 2003. The observed changes in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) characteristics just two days prior to the onset are discussed. It is observed that the MABL increased in height up to 4 km on 6 June from an initial height 2.8 km on 5 June. The top of the MABL dried up (Relative Humidity RH ~ 30\xe2\x80\x9340%) with weak and variable winds throughout the day on 6 June while the air at 850 hPa is relatively humid (RH ~ 50\xe2\x80\x9380%) but not saturated. A sequential increase in RH is associated with a change in the winds from southwesterly to westerly from 6 June onwards until the onset date. The changes in the lower and middle troposphere flow patterns over the Arabian Sea and Indian region are highlighted.'

Using conventional criteria to assess trophic state, most water-bodies were eutrophic or hypereutrophic when judged by total phosphorus and chlorophyll content but as a whole the lakes sampled were low in nitrogen. Nitrogen: phosphorus ratios (generally < 10) and a significant empirical relation for chlorophyll-nitrogen provide evidence that nitrogen limited algal biomass.

Abstract: 'Rainfall mechanism over the rain-shadow region of north peninsular India during the summer monsoon season has been investigated using dynamic, thermodynamic, cloud microphysics and cloud dynamic (CMCD) forcings. Daily rainfall data has been used to understand rainfall variability. Daily ECMWF wind data for the period 2009\xe2\x80\x932011 have been used to study the wind divergence, shear and vertical velocity profiles. Daily thermodynamic parameters from upper air soundings of Hyderabad (17.448\xc2\xb0N, 78.381\xc2\xb0E), have been examined. Aircraft data have been used to study CMCD parameters. The divergence is found between surfaces to 850\xc2\xa0hPa level whereas the convergence is at 850\xc2\xa0hPa, which comes down to surface level during presence of low pressure systems. The divergence is observed at low (700\xc2\xa0hPa), mid (600\xe2\x80\x93300\xc2\xa0hPa) and upper (250\xe2\x80\x93150\xc2\xa0hPa) tropospheric levels. In consequence of these divergence structures, three types of cloud systems viz. shallow, congestus and deep are developed with bases just above 850\xc2\xa0hPa and tops at corresponding three divergent levels. The vertical profiles of relative humidity observed by radiosonde data have been analyzed to get the frequency distribution of shallow, congestus and deep clouds. The highest frequency observed is that of congestus clouds. The thermodynamic structure shows dry surface level and warm and moist middle troposphere with tongues of dry air and multilevel inversions which have been attributed to advection of aerosol-rich dry air. The aircraft observations showed high aerosol concentrations from surface to 5\xc2\xa0km, polluted clouds with cloud droplet effective radius smaller than that required for collision\xe2\x80\x93coalescence process. The factors which are responsible for causing low rainfall over the rain-shadow area have been identified.\n'

Abstract: 'The need to carry out biological conservation outside protected areas requires avoiding, minimizing or mitigating impacts brought about by habitat transformation upon the biota. Usually, forest plantations hold fewer species than the original forest. However, structurally complex plantations support more species and individuals than simpler ones. Here we test if this phenomenon occurs in amphibian and reptilian assemblages, analyzing information regarding their richness and abundance in forestry plantations from 14 countries and 72 case studies which compare species richness and abundance in plantations and forests. Among amphibians, species richness is lower in plantations than in forests while among reptiles there is no significant difference. The abundance of reptiles increases in plantations. Three studies dealt with reptile assemblages in relation to structural complexity of plantation, which suggest that species richness and abundance is higher in complex plantations. Despite accounting for 50\xc2\xa0% of the terrestrial vertebrates, herpetological studies account for 15\xc2\xa0% of the research available regarding the impact of plantation upon vertebrates, information deficiency that hampers decision-making on the conservation of herpetozoans outside protected areas.'

Abstract: 'The objective of this study is to develop a soil erosion and sediment yield model based on the kinematic wave approximation using the finite element method, remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) for calculating the soil erosion and sediment yield in a watershed. Detachment of soil particles by overland flow occurs when the shear stress at the surface overcomes the gravitational forces and cohesive forces on the particles. Deposition occurs when the sediment load is greater than the transport capacity. Beasley et al.\xe2\x80\x99s (Trans ASAE 23:938\xe2\x80\x93944, 1980) transport equations for laminar and turbulent flow conditions are used to calculate the transport capacity. The model is capable of handling distributed information about land use, slope, soil and Manning\xe2\x80\x99s roughness. The model is applied to the Catsop watershed in the Netherlands and the Harsul watershed in India. Remotely sensed data has been used to extract land use/land cover map of the Harsul watershed, and other thematic maps are generated using the GIS. The simulated results for both calibration and validation events are compared with the observed data for the watersheds and found to be reasonable. Statistical evaluation of model performance has been carried out. Further, a sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to study the effect of variation in model parameter values on computed volume of sediment, peak sediment and the time to peak sediment. Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out for grid size variation and time step variation of the Catsop watershed. The proposed model is useful in predicting the hydrographs and sedigraphs in the agricultural watersheds.'

Abstract: 'Spatial and temporal (pre- and post-monsoon) beach morphological changes along the Udupi district, Karnataka are investigated during 2011 and 2012. Beach profile surveys were carried out using traditional techniques at twelve selected beaches and estimated the cross sectional area and sediment volume changes. The data collected were computed and analysed using SANDS free software. Finally, based on beach profile changes, the inter-annual variabilities were quantified in-terms of cross-sectional area and sediment volumes. During the southwest monsoon period, width of the beaches in the study area reduced greatly and minimum volume of sediment is stored. The sediment volume was high during the post-monsoon season compared to the pre-monsoon season. Cross sectional area analysis reveals that most of the beaches in the study area accreted by >30%. However, the maximum reduction in areal extent at Mattu Katpadi, Gangolli, Maravanthe and Navunda beaches took place during the SW monsoon. Although cyclic in nature, large-scale erosion was found during SW monsoon but the lost sediment is regained in the post-monsoon period. Human interventions play a vital role in shoreline changes, in addition to natural processes.'

Abstract: 'Groundwater studies often involve using any one of geophysical, geological, geochemical, or chemical data in the assessment of its characteristics. An integrated method in using all the above had been carried out for more comprehensive and confirmative assessments along the Thandava River basin, India. The geophysical data included the recording of the vertical electrical soundings by Schlumberger array configuration in 50 stations along the basin. Thirty soil samples and rainfall data of 5\xc2\xa0years included the geological data. Chemical characterizations for 117 groundwater water samples were carried for two seasons. This study proposes the advantages besides delineating the approach in carrying integrated rather than mere single parameter-based speculative study. This correlative and computer modeling aided study led to an in-depth along with confirmative assessments on various geological, geophysical, and chemical characteristics of the groundwater along with the pollution status. Comprehensive details of groundwater like geomorphology, potential water zones, flow pattern, soil types, geochemical evolution of ions, chemical status, and suitability can be accessed by applying this type of integrated study.'

Abstract: "Studies (1996\xe2\x80\x93'99) on the community structure of a mangrove forest in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in the Godavari estuarine system on the East Coast of India revealed altogether 15 species of mangroves represented by 8 families and 10 genera besides, 6 associate plant species and 6 of marshgrass. Description of forest structure (PCQM method) included measures of species composition, tree density, basal area and spatial distribution patterns of component vegetation at 75 GPS fixed locations. Avicennia marina, A. officinalis, Excoecaria agallocha, Aegiceras corniculatum, Sonneratia apetala, Ceriops decandra, Rhizophora apiculata and R. mucronata were the important mangrove species. Tree density varied between 47 and 1731 stems/0.1 ha and basal area 0.1 and 10.9 m2/0.01 ha. With the help of multivariate analysis (PRIMER) and based on species composition and tree density, it was possible to subdivide the sites into five groups that showed characteristic zonation patterns. For example, E. agallocha was typical of landward locations. A. marina (along with A. officinalis and A. alba) represented sites at the bed level and neap high tide level. There was a large group of sites inhabited by diverse species (14) indicative of spring high tide level conditions. Tidal elevation and ambient salinity appeared important in determining the observed zonation."

Abstract: 'The study aims at evaluating the various drought indices for the humid, semi-arid and arid regions of India using conventional indices, such as rainfall anomaly index, departure analysis of rainfall and other indices such as Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) that were analyzed using the DrinC software. In SPI, arid region has seven drought years, whereas humid and semi-arid regions have four. In case of RDI, the humid and semi-arid regions have 11 drought years, whereas arid regions have 10\xc2\xa0years. The difference in SPI and RDI was due to the fact that RDI considered potential evapotranspiration, and hence, correlation with plants would be better in case of RDI. Humid region showed a decreasing trend in initial value of RDI during the drought as compared to semiarid and arid regions and indicated possible climate change impact in these regions. Among all the indices, RDI was considered as an effective indicator because of implicit severity and high prediction matches with the actual drought years. SPI and RDI were found to be well correlated with respect to 3\xc2\xa0months rainfall data and SPI values led to prediction of annual RDI. The results of our study established that this correlation could be used for developing disaster management plan well in advance to combat the drought consequences.'

Abstract: 'To understand the organic matter (OM) sources and trophic states, spatial and seasonal (post-monsoon and pre-monsoon) variation in sedimentary OM compositions was investigated in seven tropical estuaries of the state of Maharashtra along the central west coast of India. Based on the result of cluster analysis, estuaries were segregated into two distinct groups: Northern Maharashtra and Southern Maharashtra owing to dissimilarity in OM characteristics potentially constrained by geomorphology and catchment properties. Enrichment of Corg and major biochemical compounds (lipids, carbohydrates and proteins) in the middle zone of most estuaries highlighted towards the addition of allochthonous OM. Results of principal component analysis highlighted the similar source of OM in most of the estuaries during both seasons and their distribution largely constrained by grain size change. The benthic trophic state indicated the prevalence of eutrophic state in the middle zone of the investigated estuaries, which may be sporadic and dependent upon anthropogenic activities in the study area.'

Abstract: 'Human communities inhabiting remote and geomorphically fragile high-altitude regions are particularly vulnerable to climate change-related glacial hazards and hydrometeorological extremes. This study presents a strategy for enhancing adaptation and resilience of communities living immediately downstream of two potentially hazardous glacial lakes in the Upper Chenab Basin of the Western Himalaya in India. It uses an interdisciplinary investigative framework, involving ground surveys, participatory mapping, comparison of local perceptions of environmental change and hazards with scientific data, identification of assets and livelihood resources at risk, assessment of existing community-level adaptive capacity and resilience and a brief review of governance issues. In addition to recommending specific actions for securing lives and livelihoods in the study area, the study demonstrates the crucial role of regional ground-level, community-centric assessments in evolving an integrated approach to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation for high-altitude environments, particularly in the developing world.'

Abstract: 'The present study was conducted during July 2013 (early phase of monsoon or EM) and September 2013 (later phase of monsoon or LM) to ascertain the intra-monsoonal variation on zooplankton, by selecting 15 study stations in the river Saptamukhi, one of the main estuaries in the Sundarbans Estuarine System (SES). In 2013, SES experienced an unusually high monsoonal rainfall also exacerbated by cloud burst event at Himalayan region (upper stretches of SES) which tremendously increased the river runoff. The present work was aimed to decipher the effect of this unusual precipitation during the monsoon season on zooplankton assemblages along with different hydrological parameters. The abundance of zooplankton was recorded as lower during EM compared to LM. Altogether, 56 zooplankton taxa were identified with copepods forming the predominant population. Thirty-three copepod species were reported with 25 calanoid species forming the bulk of the biomass followed by 5 and 3 species of cyclopoids and harpacticoid, respectively. A combination of multivariate cluster analysis, biotic indices, and canonical correspondence analysis revealed noticeable alterations in the zooplankton community structure across the spatio-temporal scale. Furthermore, significant intra-monsoonal changes in zooplankton population correlated with several hydrological parameters were clearly noticed. Paracalanus parvus, Bestiolina similis and Oithona similis were observed to be the most dominant copepod species in both sampling periods. The result of the present study provides new insight on estuarine zooplankton community after unusual rainfall during monsoon season, and provides further evidence to support the conservation and management of the SES ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents the first comprehensive report of the organochlorine pesticide residues (OCs) such as hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its six metabolites (DDTs), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in core sediments (<63-\xce\xbcm particle size) from the Indian Sunderban wetland. The pooled mean values of the mass fraction of \xce\xa3HCHs, HCB, and \xce\xa3DDTs in the sediments were 0.05\xe2\x80\x9312, 0.05\xe2\x80\x931.4, and 0.05\xe2\x80\x9311.5\xc2\xa0ng g\xe2\x88\x921 dry weight, respectively. The vertical distribution of pesticides reveals an erratic pattern. The concentration of four isomers of HCHs reveals a heterogenic distribution where \xce\xb3-HCH (lindane) and \xce\xb2-HCH shared the dominant part. The mass fraction of HCB did not show any sharp spatial variation. The prevailing sequence of DDT metabolites indicates an active degradation of the parent compound in the sediments and/or inputs of already degraded pp\xe2\x80\x99DDT to the region. Peak concentrations of HCH isomers and DDT metabolites have the potential to induce ecotoxicological impact as per the sediment quality guidelines.'

Abstract: 'In this paper, an attempt has been made to delineate groundwater potential zones in Hingoli district, Maharashtra, India. Remote sensing and traditional data were collected from different sources and analysed in GIS software to prepare thematic maps of different geo-environmental factors such as lithology, drainage, lineaments, slope etc. as these factors having an impact on groundwater availability of an area, directly or indirectly. All these factors have been integrated into GIS software and multi influence factor method was applied to delineate groundwater potential zones. The result has shown about 50% area is having the good potentiality of groundwater, whereas about 6% region falls under very low potential area. The Central part of the study area is having very low groundwater potential, mainly due to the steep slope and rocky outcrop. The southern part of the Hingoli district has shown good groundwater potential, because of the gentle slope which influences water to infiltrate. All the major towns and villages are located in good groundwater prospect areas. Therefore, these locations do not experience extreme drought conditions. The present work is valuable for future planning and management of groundwater resource in Hingoli district.'

Abstract: 'Many hydrological approaches have been developed for humid areas; however, we still have many challenges regarding flash floods simulation in arid regions. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to develop a physically based hydrological model for flash floods simulation, to understand the hydrological processes, and to overcome the water relating problems, as water scarcity, data deficiency. In this study, Hydrological River Basin Environmental Assessment Model incorporating wadi system (Hydro-BEAM-WaS) integrated with both Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data is proposed. To overcome the lack of observational data, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) data has been compared with the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) data. We found that the GSMaP has an overestimated or underestimated systematic seasonal bias. Wadi El-Khoud in Oman was chosen for model calibration, while the River Nile basin in Egypt was chosen for flash flood simulations. The simulation has been successfully carried out where it exhibits a reasonable fit between both the simulated and observed results, in spite of the deficiency of high quality observations. This approach can be used to evaluate and simulate the wadi runoff behaviors, such as discontinuous surface flow. It also can help in estimating the initial and transmission losses. Flash flood water has been assessed and evaluated as new water resources, which would be properly utilized to overcome the problem of water shortage in such regions. The proposed model has been proven to provide reliable simulations of flash floods referring to ungauged wadi systems.'

Abstract: 'Over the last ten years we have seen great efforts focused on revising amphibian systematics. Phylogenetic reconstructions derived from DNA sequence data have played a central role in these revisionary studies but have typically under-sampled the diverse frog family Microhylidae. Here, we present a detailed phylogenetic study focused on expanding previous hypotheses of relationships within this cosmopolitan family. Specifically, we placed an emphasis on assessing relationships among New World genera and those taxa with uncertain phylogenetic affinities (i.e., incertae sedis).'

Abstract: 'Sediments collected from the River Buriganga were analyzed by using ICP-MS for spatial (site-to-site) and seasonal variations of a large number of elements, as many as 48. Out of these elements, 15 elements were given more attention because of their detrimental effects on human health and aquatic lives.

These results indicate that concentrations of the studied elements were almost the same in both the seasons. However, the concentrations were slightly higher in winter than those in monsoon with respect to spatial variation. The higher concentrations of Cr in both the seasons were due to direct discharge of tanning effluents for a long time. Values of contamination factor (Cf), degree of contamination (Cd), pollution load index and ecological risk potential (RI) factors for the selected toxic elements, i.e., Cr, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd, As, Hg in the surface sediments, indicated that the contamination status in the studied area was low. The low contamination level may be due to steps taken by the authorities to prevent direct discharge of industrial effluents in the River Buriganga in the recent years.'

Title: 'Litter production, leaf litter decomposition and nutrient return in Cunninghamia lanceolata plantations in south China: effect of planting conifers with broadleaved species'

Abstract: 'This study compared litter production, litter decomposition and nutrient return in pure and mixed species plantations. Dry weight and N, P, K, Ca, Mg quantities in the litterfall were measured in one pure Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation (PC) and two mixed-species plantations of C. lanceolata with Alnus cremastogyne (MCA) and Kalopanax septemlobus (MCK) in subtropical China. Covering 6 years of observations, mean annual litter production of MCA (4.97\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921) and MCK (3.97\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921) was significantly higher than that of PC (3.46\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xb7ha\xe2\x88\x921). Broadleaved trees contributed 42% of the total litter production in MCA and 31% in MCK. Introduction of broadleaved tree species had no significant effect on litterfall pattern. Total litterfall was greatest in the dry season from November to March. Nutrient returns to the forest floor through leaf litter were significantly higher in both MCA and MCK than in PC (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). The amounts of N, K, and Mg returned to the forest floor through leaf litter were highest in the MCA, and P and Ca returns were highest in the MCK. Percent contribution of broadleaf litter to total nutrient returns ranged from 41.7% to 86.9% in MCA and from 49.3% to 74.8% in MCK. The decomposition rate of individual leaf litter increased in the order: C. lanceolata\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89K. septemlobus\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89A. cremastogyne. Litter mixing had a positive effect on decomposition rate of the more recalcitrant litter and promoted nutrient return. Relative to mass loss of A. cremastogyne decomposing alone, higher mass loss of the mixture of C. lanceolata and A. cremastogyne was observed after 330 days of decomposition. These results indicate that mixed plantations of different tree species have advantages over monospecific plantations with regards to nutrient fluxes and these advantages have relevance to restoration of degraded sites.'

Abstract: 'With growing population and urbanization, there is an increasing exploitation of natural resources, and this often results to environmental pollution. In this review, the levels of heavy metal in lentic compartments (water, sediment, fishes, and aquatic plants) over the past two decades (1997\xe2\x80\x932017) have been summarized to evaluate the current pollution status of this ecosystem. In all the compartments, the heavy metals dominated are zinc followed by iron. The major reason could be area mineralogy and lithogenic sources. Enormous quantity of metals like iron in estuarine sediment is a very natural incident due to the permanently reducing condition of organic substances. Contamination of cadmium, lead, and chromium was closely associated with anthropogenic origin. In addition, surrounding land use and atmospheric deposition could have been responsible for substantial pollution. The accumulation of heavy metals in fishes and aquatic plants is the result of time-dependent deposition in lentic ecosystems. Moreover, various potential risk assessment methods for heavy metals were discussed. This review concludes that natural phenomena dominate the accumulation of essential heavy metals in lentic ecosystems compared to anthropogenic sources. Amongst other recent reviews on heavy metals from other parts of the world, the present review is executed in such a way that it explains the presence of heavy metals not only in water environment, but also in the whole of the lentic system comprising sediment, fishes, and aquatic plants.'

Title: 'Deep RNA-Seq profile reveals biodiversity, plant\xe2\x80\x93microbe interactions and a large family of NBS-LRR resistance genes in walnut (Juglans regia) tissues'

Abstract: 'Deep RNA-Seq profiling, a revolutionary method used for quantifying transcriptional levels, often includes non-specific transcripts from other co-existing organisms in spite of stringent protocols. Using the recently published walnut genome sequence as a filter, we present a broad analysis of the RNA-Seq derived transcriptome profiles obtained from twenty different tissues to extract the biodiversity and possible plant\xe2\x80\x93microbe interactions in the walnut ecosystem in California. Since the residual nature of the transcripts being analyzed does not provide sufficient information to identify the exact strain, inferences made are constrained to the genus level. The presence of the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora was detected in the root through the presence of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cryptococcus, the causal agent of cryptococcosis, was found in the catkins and vegetative buds, corroborating previous work indicating that the plant surface supported the sexual cycle of this human pathogen. The RNA-Seq profile revealed several species of the endophytic nitrogen fixing Actinobacteria. Another bacterial species implicated in aerobic biodegradation of methyl tert-butyl ether (Methylibium petroleiphilum) is also found in the root. RNA encoding proteins from the pea aphid were found in the leaves and vegetative buds, while a serine protease from mosquito with significant homology to a female reproductive tract protease from Drosophila mojavensis in the vegetative bud suggests egg-laying activities. The comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data present also unraveled detailed, tissue-specific information of ~400 transcripts encoded by the largest family of resistance (R) genes (NBS-LRR), which possibly rationalizes the resistance of the specific walnut plant to the pathogens detected. Thus, we elucidate the biodiversity and possible plant\xe2\x80\x93microbe interactions in several walnut (Juglans regia) tissues in California using deep RNA-Seq profiling.'

Abstract: 'In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and relationships in C. olitorius by analysing populations representing different distribution areas, and developed a hypothesis on the origin and spread of the species in the pantropics. We employed amplified fragment lengths polymorphism (AFLP) and morphometric analyses in a total of 101 C. olitorius accessions. Results of both data sets are mostly congruent. The molecular analysis indicated generally low genetic diversity within populations and the Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (He) ranged from 0.0457 to 0.0955 with a mean of 0.0763. Qualitative traits, especially related to leaf morphology, branching habit and stipule color were the taxonomically most informative characters. The highest morphological variability occurred within African accessions, indicating that this species originally evolved in Africa. In both analyses, the Asian materials were nested within African populations, especially with those from North and East Africa. This indicates an African origin of the species and we hypothesise that dispersal occurred via the Mediterranean\xe2\x80\x93Indian trade routes instead of natural migration along the coasts from western Africa to the Indian subcontinent. Both analyses revealed materials from Ethiopia to be quite distinct. The highest number of private bands (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa035), percent polymorphism (29.29%), and gene diversity (0.0955) were also detected in wild accessions collected from Ethiopia, suggesting a long-term spatial isolation of C. olitorius populations in the country. Germplasm samples from this region could therefore be a useful source of genetic variation in jute breeding programs.'

Abstract: 'Sagar Lake is situated in the middle of the Sagar City in the Vindhyan terrain of Bundelkhand region of India at an elevation of 517\xc2\xa0m above mean sea level. The lake surface area and volume are 145\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89104\xc2\xa0m2 and 389\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89104\xc2\xa0m3 at full tank level. Sedimentation rates and pattern in the lake have been estimated using 137Cs and 210Pb radiometric dating techniques. The lake has been subdivided into eight zones on the basis of sedimentation rate and under water topography. The sedimentation rate in the lake has been found to vary between 0.30 and 1.08\xc2\xa0cm/a depending upon the location. The estimated mean sedimentation rate is 0.58\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.028\xc2\xa0cm/a. The observed sedimentation pattern reveals that the sedimentation rate decreases from near shore to far shore and minimum at the deepest part of the lake. The estimated useful life of the lake based on Post-1964 average sedimentation rate is around 467\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8923\xc2\xa0years.'

Title: 'Estimation of genetic variability and population structure in Sapindus trifoliatus L., using DNA fingerprinting methods'

Abstract: 'Genetic variability and population structure of Sapindus trifoliatus L. (Sapindaceae), collected from Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh states were estimated using three DNA fingerprinting methods viz., random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), directed amplification of minisatellite DNA (DAMD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR). The cumulative data analysis carried out for all three markers showed 69.42\xc2\xa0% polymorphism. The intra-population genetic diversity analysis revealed the highest values of Nei\xe2\x80\x99s genetic diversity (0.16), Shannon information index (0.24) and polymorphic loci (43.99\xc2\xa0%) among Bhavnagar (BH) population, whereas lowest values were found in Junagarh (JU) population. The maximum inter-population average genetic distance (0.20) was between Allahabad (AL) and JU populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed highest percentage of variation among individuals of populations (56\xc2\xa0%) followed by 25\xc2\xa0% among populations and 19\xc2\xa0% among regions. Principal coordinate analysis and UPGMA dendrogram revealed that genetic diversity was in congruence with the geographical diversity. The data strongly suggest that low genetic flow, geographic isolation and to some extent genetic drift are the major factors responsible for high genetic differentiation. Preservation of genetic diversity of S. trifoliatus is important, both to promote adaptability of the populations to changing environment as well as to preserve a large gene pool for future genetic improvement. The present study using RAPD, DAMD and ISSR profiles of S. trifoliatus provide the means of rapid characterization of accessions within the populations, and thus enable the selection of appropriate accessions for further utilization in conservation and prospection programs of this important plant genetic resource.'

Abstract: 'Optimization of irrigation water is an important issue in agricultural production for maximizing the return from the limited water availability. The current study proposes a simulation\xe2\x80\x93optimization framework for developing optimal irrigation schedules for rice crop (Oryza sativa) under water deficit conditions. The framework utilizes a rice crop growth simulation model to identify the critical periods of growth that are highly sensitive to the reduction in final crop yield, and a genetic algorithm based optimizer develops the optimal water allocations during the crop growing period. The model ORYZA2000, which is employed as the crop growth simulation model, is calibrated and validated using field experimental data prior to incorporating in the proposed framework. The proposed framework was applied to a real world case study of a command area in southern India, and it was found that significant improvement in total yield can be achieved by the model compared to other water saving irrigation methods. The results of the study were highly encouraging and suggest that by employing a calibrated crop growth model combined with an optimization algorithm can lead to achieve maximum water use efficiency.'

Abstract: 'Present studies on the community characteristics of earthworms revealed the occurrence of 11 species of earthworms in the pineapple (Ananus comosus) and 14 species in the mixed fruit plantations of west Tripura (India). While 9 species of earthworms namely Drawida assamensis, Drawida papillifer papillifer, Drawida nepalensis, Kanchuria sp., Metaphire houlleti, Eutyphoeus gigas, Eutyphoeus scutarius, Eutyphoeus comillahnus and Pontoscolex corethrurus are of common occurrence to both the pineapple and the mixed fruit plantations, two and five earthworm species namely Kanchuria sumerianus, Eutyphoeus sp. and Metaphire posthuma, Perionyx excavatus, Lampito mauritii, Amynthus alexandri, Eutyphoeus gammiei are restricted to the pineapple and the mixed fruit plantations respectively. Earthworms were found mostly within 15\xc2\xa0cm depth of soils having temperature 25\xe2\x80\x9325.8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, moisture 18.8\xe2\x80\x9322.4\xc2\xa0%, water holding capacity 26\xe2\x80\x9331.7\xc2\xa0% and organic matter content 2.4\xe2\x80\x934.0\xc2\xa0%. Mean earthworm densities (158\xc2\xa0ind.\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922) was significantly higher (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01, t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09.67) and biomass (36.67\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922) significantly lower (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01, t\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x925.98) in the pineapple plantation than the mixed fruit plantation (density 93\xc2\xa0ind.\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922, biomass 56\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922). High density value of earthworms in pineapple plantation is linked with dominance of D. assamensis and high biomass value in mixed fruit plantation was due to the higher relative abundance of larger species like E. gigas, E. scutarius, E. comillahnus and E. gammiei. Compared to the mixed fruit plantation, significantly (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05) higher index of dominance, lower index of diversity, species richness index and species evenness were recorded in the pineapple plantation.'

Abstract: 'Uranium is a radioactive element normally present in hexavalent form as U(VI) in solution and elevated levels in drinking water cause health hazards. Representative groundwater samples were collected from different litho-units in this region and were analyzed for total U and major and minor ions. Results indicate that the highest U concentration (113\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x88\x921) was found in granitic terrains of this region and about 10\xc2\xa0% of the samples exceed the permissible limit for drinking water. Among different species of U in aqueous media, carbonate complexes [UO2(CO3) 2 2\xe2\x88\x92 ] are found to be dominant. Groundwater with higher U has higher pCO2 values, indicating weathering by bicarbonate ions resulting in preferential mobilization of U in groundwater. The major minerals uraninite and coffinite were found to be supersaturated and are likely to control the distribution of U in the study area. Nature of U in groundwater, the effects of lithology on hydrochemistry and factors controlling its distribution in hard rock aquifers of Madurai district are highlighted in this paper.'

Abstract: 'Phthalate esters are well known for their environmental contamination and toxicological effects as \xe2\x80\x9cendocrine disruptors.\xe2\x80\x9d In this study, environmental levels of phthalate esters and ecotoxicological risk assessments were performed in one of the major rivers in India, the Kaveri. Water and sediment samples were collected during 2010\xe2\x80\x932012 representing the major stretch of the river and extracted by solid-phase and ultrasonic methods, respectively, and analyzed for six major phthalates by using a gas chromatograph\xe2\x80\x93mass spectrometer. The analytical recovery for phthalates in water and sediment ranged from 79 to 121\xc2\xa0%. Results indicated that diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dimethyl phthalate were found in every sample, whereas butylbenzyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were detected in 92\xc2\xa0% of the water samples. Likewise, in sediment samples, DEP was found most often (94\xc2\xa0%). The total phthalates in water samples ranged from 313 to 1,640\xc2\xa0ng/l, whereas in sediments it was 2 to 1,438\xc2\xa0ng/g dw (dry weight) with DEHP having the highest concentration. Human health risk assessment based on drinking water consumption showed no potential risk for phthalates and also DEHP levels were safe with respect to USEPA guideline (6,000\xc2\xa0ng/l). Further, DEHP and di-n-octyl phthalate levels in water were expected to pose little threat to sensitive organisms in the riverine ecosystem as per ECOSAR chronic values. In case of sediment, the DEHP concentration was well above the USEPA sediment guideline value. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the levels and ecotoxicological risks of phthalates in Kaveri River, India.'

Abstract: 'Certain wood quality parameters of about 9-year-old Melia dubia Cav. trees grown in a seedling seed orchard at Yeshwanthpura Research Station of Kolar research range, Karnataka India were studied. Trees were categorized into three classes depending upon their girth at the breast height\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93small (<40\xc2\xa0cm), medium (40\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xa0cm) and big (>60\xc2\xa0cm). Different anatomical (gross structure), physical and mechanical properties of the wood were evaluated using standard testing procedures and Indian Standards. The results of this study showed that there was no significant difference in the heartwood percentage and specific gravity among three girth classes. High shrinkage values from green to oven-dry condition in all the classes indicate that the timber is dimensionally unstable compared to teak. The static bending strength parameters\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93FS at LP, MOR and MOE, compression strength parallel to grain, compressive strength perpendicular to grain at limit of proportionality and surface hardness (side and end) were evaluated and compared among all the three girth classes. The data on mechanical properties were statistically analysed using ANOVA between three girth classes. The results on wood quality parameters may be utilized in selection of suitable genotypes for raising large scale plantations.'

Abstract: 'This article focuses on the temporal and spatial distribution of three organophosphorous pesticides\xe2\x80\x95malathion, methyl parathion, and chlorpyrifos\xe2\x80\x95in the sedimentary environment of a backwater ecosystem, Kuttanad backwaters, situated in Kerala, India. Based on salinity distribution, geographic characteristics, and human activities prevailing in the area, the study area was divided into three zones: zone 1 with riverine characteristics, zone 2 with freshwater characteristics during and after the monsoon season and estuarine characteristics during the premonsoon season, and zone 3 with estuarine characteristics. The organophosphorus pesticides in the study area showed the order of enrichment as chlorpyrifos >malathion >methyl parathion. While studying the variations in pesticide concentrations seasonally, higher concentrations were observed during the premonsoon monsoon season, with the concentrations being lower than the detectable level. Sediment characteristics, such as pH, texture, organic carbon, moisture content, etc., had reflective effect on the degradation rates of pesticides. The runoff water from the paddy fields made a larger contribution of pesticide pollution to the study area.'

Abstract: 'Sulfide distribution is a key controller of vegetation zonation in coastal ecosystems, but data are limited regarding its impact on the spatial distribution of important N cycling processes. We assessed vegetation distribution and density and, mineral N pool sizes, composition and transformations in a sulfidic coastal marsh in relation to distance from sulfur springs. We observed strong relationships between vegetation attributes (species and density) and mineral N status with greater total inorganic N, NO3\xe2\x88\x92 and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in sediment samples from areas populated by Crithmum maritimum (mid-way between S springs and sea shore) than in sediments from areas colonized by either Agropyron repens (closest to the S springs) or mangrove (Rhizophora mangleL., farthest from the springs). Our data also suggest close links between N cycling and SO4\xe2\x88\x922 reduction. The latter resulted in net release of NH4+ ranging from 0.9\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 in the low density C. maritimum to 3.2\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 in the high-density A. repens, during a 3-day incubation. We also tested for microbial adaptation to long-term high sulfide exposure by measuring DEA using the C2H2 block method (which has been found to be strongly affected by the presence of sulfide) and amendment of marsh sediment samples with NaMoO4 to suppress reduced S production. In sediments extracted from sites near the sulfur springs (A. repens and C. maritimum), the C2H2 blockage assay yielded similar results without and with NaMoO4 addition. However, in samples from a mangrove located further downstream from the springs, DEA was substantially lower (2.3 vs. 6.8\xc2\xa0mg N2O-N\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 sediment d\xe2\x88\x921) when production of reduced S was not inhibited by NaMoO4. These results suggest that denitrifying microbes in the high sulfide areas may have adapted to the presence of sulfide, allowing for high rates of N and S cycling to occur simultaneously in these marshes.'

Abstract: 'The response of decomposition of litter for the dominant tree species in disturbed (pine), rehabilitated (pine and broadleaf mixed) and mature (monsoon evergreen broadleaf) forests in subtropical China to simulated N deposition was studied to address the following hypothesis: (1) litter decomposition is faster in mature forest (high soil N availability) than in rehabilitated/disturbed forests (low soil N availability); (2) litter decomposition is stimulated by N addition in rehabilitated and disturbed forests due to their low soil N availability; (3) N addition has little effect on litter decomposition in mature forest due to its high soil N availability. The litterbag method (a total of 2880 litterbags) and N treatments: Control-no N addition, Low-N: \xe2\x88\x925\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921, Medium-N: \xe2\x88\x9210\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921, and High-N: \xe2\x88\x9215\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0m\xe2\x88\x922 y\xe2\x88\x921, were employed to evaluate decomposition. Results indicated that mature forest, which has likely been N saturated due to both long-term high N deposition in the region and the age of the ecosystem, had the highest litter decomposition rate, and exhibited no significant positive and even some negative response to nitrogen additions. However, both disturbed and rehabilitated forests, which are still N limited due to previous land use history, exhibited slower litter decomposition rates with significant positive effects from nitrogen additions. These results suggest that litter decomposition and its responses to N addition in subtropical forests of China vary depending on the nitrogen status of the ecosystem.'

Abstract: 'Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus has a long-standing history of bacterial-plant interrelationship as a symbiotic endophyte capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. In low nitrogen fertilized sugarcane fields it plays a significant role and its occurrence was realised in most of the sugarcane growing countries. In this mini review, the association of G. diazotrophicus with sugarcane, other crop plants and with various hosts is discussed. The factors affecting survival in the rhizosphere and the putative soil mode of transmission are emphasized. In addition, other N2-fixing Acetobacteraceae members, including Gluconacetobacter azotocaptans, Gluconacetobacter johannae and Swaminathania salitolerans, occurring in coffee, corn and rice plants are also covered. Lastly, the plant-growth-promoting traits identified in this group of bacteria, including N2 fixation, phytohormone synthesis, P and Zn solubilization and biocontrol, are analysed.'

Abstract: ' Calamus guruba Buch.-Ham., a perennial, dioecious rattan species of the family Arecaceae has recently emerged as an important source of tribal economy owing to its high-quality flexible canes for furniture manufacturing and cottage industries. The dioecious nature together with disproportionate distribution of male and female sex organs has been the major constraint in the development of an effective breeding programme for the plant. Early identification of the male and female genotypes at the seedling stage is a pre-requisite to ensure genetic improvement of C. guruba. In the present study, we used 30 inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to develop a sequence-tagged site (STS) linked to male sex in C. guruba. Molecular analysis of bulked DNA pooled from male and female genotypes resulted in the isolation of a putative male-specific marker CgMSM. Partial sequencing of CgMSM resulted in an STS marker CgMY1 which could successfully amplify a 597-bp fragment in male but not in the female plants. DNA gel blot analysis confirmed it as a single-copy locus in the male genome of C. guruba. Further validation of CgMY1 in the natural population of C. guruba resulted in precise detection of 9 males and 6 females from 15 individuals with unknown sex. Therefore, the STS marker CgMY1 could be used as a proficient tool for early sex differentiation and form the basis of a sustainable breeding programme for genetic improvement of C. guruba.'

Abstract: 'This study addresses the issues of spatial distribution, dispersal, and genetic heterogeneity in social groups of the cellular slime molds (CSMs). The CSMs are soil amoebae with an unusual life cycle that consists of alternating solitary and social phases. Because the social phase involves division of labor with what appears to be an extreme form of \xe2\x80\x9caltruism\xe2\x80\x9d, the CSMs raise interesting evolutionary questions regarding the origin and maintenance of sociality. Knowledge of the genetic structure of social groups in the wild is necessary for answering these questions. We confirm that CSMs are widespread in undisturbed forest soil from South India. They are dispersed over long distances via the dung of a variety of large mammals. Consistent with this mode of dispersal, most social groups in the two species examined for detailed study, Dictyostelium giganteum and Dictyostelium purpureum, are multi-clonal.'

Abstract: 'The hilly terrains of Himalaya are among the most vulnerable of the regions of India due to natural hazards. Different kinds of landslides occur frequently in the tectonically and geodynamically active region of Himalaya. Transportation, public networks, and all kinds of socioeconomic activities that occur in the high hills of the Lesser Himalaya are entirely dependent upon the local road and highway network in this region. However, the stability of the slopes that have been cut to construct and/or widen roads and highways is a major concern in hilly regions. Unplanned excavations performed by blasting have resulted in these cut slopes that are on the verge of instability. Such slopes become vulnerable under the influence of factors such as heavy rainfall, seismic activity, dynamic loading, and/or various kinds of human intervention. Any kind of slope failure can lead to disruption of traffic, losses of property and lives, injuries, as well as environmental degradation. In the present study, a slope stability analysis was performed of road-cut slopes along about 20\xc2\xa0km of NH-109 from Rudraprayag to Agastmuni in the state of Uttarakhand in India. Based on field observations and variations in geological and geotechnical conditions, five locations were chosen for detailed study, including a laboratory study and numerical analysis. The two-dimensional conventional limit equilibrium method and a numerical technique based on the finite element method were used to analyze the cut slopes. This comparative analysis of slope stability provided a deeper understanding of this issue. The results of the analyses performed using both methods aided in identifying potentially vulnerable slopes and enabled us to compare the two methods.'

Abstract: 'Pesticides residues were quantified in 109 frogs comprising two species (Fejervarya limnocharis and Hoplobatrachus crassus) from organic and conventional paddy farms in Kerala, India. Seven frogs from conventional but none from the organic farms revealed deformities. Levels of total Organochlorines (OCs) (33.22\xc2\xa0ng/g) and Synthetic Pyrethroid, Fenvalerate-II (26.91/42.15\xc2\xa0ng/g) in deformed F. limnocharis and H. crassus were significantly greater than in healthy frogs. Among OCs in healthy frogs, traces of \xce\xb3 (gamma)-HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) (2.12\xc2\xa0ng/g) were found only in F. limnocharis from organic farm. Among Organophosphates, Phorate (1.02\xc2\xa0ng/g) and Quinalphos (2.62\xc2\xa0ng/g) were present in traces in deformed F. limnocharis, while Parathion ethyl (1.02\xc2\xa0ng/g) was detected in deformed H. crassus. The data indicate that the high level of pesticides may have contributed to the deformity of frogs. Therefore, an elaborative study will be essential to conserve amphibians in India.'

Abstract: 'The present study was undertaken to examine the possible genotoxicity of ambient particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) in Pune city. In both size fractions of PM, Fe was found to be the dominant metal by concentration, contributing 22% and 30% to the total mass of metals in PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. The speciation of soluble Fe in PM10 and PM2.5 was investigated. The average fraction of Fe3+ and Fe2+ concentrations in PM2.5 was 80.6% and 19.3%, respectively, while in PM2.5 this fraction was 71.1% and 29.9%, respectively. The dominance of Fe(III) state in both PM fractions facilitates the generation of hydroxyl radicals (\xc2\xb7OH), which can damage deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA), as was evident from the gel electrophoresis study. The DNA damage by \xc2\xb7OH was supported through the in silico density functional theory (DFT) method. DFT results showed that C8 site of guanine (G)/adenine (A) and C6 site of thymine (T)/cytosine (C) would be energetically more favorable for the attack of hydroxyl radicals, when compared with the C4 and C5 sites.

Abstract: 'Amba Estuary, which receives effluent from several industries including a petrochemical complex, opens to the southern limits of the Mumbai Harbor. The study was conducted to find out the level of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs) in water and their bioconcentration in ten commercially important fishes from Amba Estuary during different months. In water high concentration of TPHs (39.7\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/L) was obtained during December (middle of estuary) and minimum value (7.2\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/L) was observed in September (lower estuarine). The maximum concentration of TPHs was found to be in Trichiurus savala (3.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/g) during December and minimum in Boleophthalmus sp (0.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5g/g) during May. Irrespective of the monthly variations, TPHs accumulation in all the species was considerably lower than hazardous levels. Although there was no statistical significance between TPHs and total length/weight, the T. savala recording maximum concentration during all months and it can be used as indicator of hydrocarbon pollution in this region.'

Title: 'How do we assess vulnerability to climate change in India? A systematic review of literature'

Abstract: 'In countries like India where multiple risks interact with socio-economic differences to create and sustain vulnerability, assessing the vulnerability of people, places, and systems to climate change is a critical tool to prioritise adaptation. In India, several vulnerability assessment tools have been designed spanning multiple disciplines, by multiple actors, and at multiple scales. However, their conceptual, methodological, and disciplinary underpinnings, and resulting implications on who is identified as vulnerable, have not been interrogated. Addressing this gap, we systematically review peer-reviewed publications (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa078) and grey literature (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa042) to characterise how vulnerability to climate change is assessed in India. We frame our enquiry against four questions: (1) How is vulnerability conceptualised (vulnerability of whom/what, vulnerability to what), (2) who assesses vulnerability, (3) how is vulnerability assessed (methodology, scale), and (4) what are the implications of methodology on outcomes of the assessment. Our findings emphasise that methods to assess vulnerability to climate change are embedded in the disciplinary traditions, methodological approaches, and often-unstated motivations of those designing the assessment. Further, while most assessments acknowledge the importance of scalar and temporal aspects of vulnerability, we find few examples of it being integrated in methodology. Such methodological myopia potentially overlooks how social differentiation, ecological shifts, and institutional dynamics construct and perpetuate vulnerability. Finally, we synthesise the strengths and weaknesses of current vulnerability assessment methods in India and identify a predominance of research in rural landscapes with a relatively lower coverage in urban and peri-urban settlements, which are key interfaces of transitions.'

Abstract: 'Coffee pulp is the main solid residue from the wet processing of coffee berries. Due to presence of anti-physiological and anti-nutritional factors, coffee pulp is not considered as adequate substrate for bioconversion process by coffee farmers. Recent stringent measures by Pollution Control authorities, made it mandatory to treat all the solid and liquid waste emanating from the coffee farms. A study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of an exotic (Eudrilus eugeniae) and a native earthworm (Perionyx ceylanesis) from coffee farm for decomposition of coffee pulp into valuable vermicompost. Exotic earthworms were found to degrade the coffee pulp faster (112\xc2\xa0days) as compared to the native worms (165\xc2\xa0days) and the vermicomposting efficiency (77.9%) and vermicompost yield (389\xc2\xa0kg) were found to significantly higher with native worms. The multiplication rate of earthworms (280%) and worm yield (3.78\xc2\xa0kg) recorded significantly higher with the exotic earthworms. The percentage of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium and magnesium in vermicompost was found to increase while C:N ratio, pH and total organic carbon declined as a function of the vermicomposting. The plant nutrients, nitrogen (80.6%), phosphorus (292%) and potassium (550%) content found to increase significantly in the vermicompost produced using native earthworms as compared to the initial values, while the calcium (85.7%) and magnesium (210%) content found to increase significantly in compost produced utilizing exotic worms. Vermicompost and vermicasts from native earthworms recorded significantly higher functional microbial group\xe2\x80\x99s population as compared to the exotic worms. The study reveals that coffee pulp can be very well used as substrate for vermicomposting using exotic (Eudrilus eugeniae) and native earthworm (Perionyx ceylanesis).'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x82Populations of soil-dwelling mites were monitored in monoculture plots of four agroforestry tree species, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Dactyladenia barteri and Treculia africana, and compared to those in grass and secondary forest plots in the dry season (December 1993 to January 1994) and in the wet season (April to June 1994) in southwest Nigeria. Mite populations were very low in all plots during the dry season (500\xe2\x80\x933000\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x932), compared to those during the wet season (10\xe2\x80\x89000\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x89000\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x932). The highest mite population was observed in Gliricidia plots (3\xe2\x80\x89044\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x932) for the dry season and Leucaena plots (30\xe2\x80\x89240\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x932) for the wet season. Mite genera that were dominant in all the experimental plots were Annectacarus, Haplozetes, Machadobelba, Scheloribates and members of the Galumnidae, Dermanyssidae and Parasitidae. The community structure of mites was similar in the soil for Treculia and Gliricidia plots and for Leucaena and Dactyladenia plots. There were more taxonomic groups of mites under Leucaena than in the other agroforestry plots. Based on the density, diversity and complexity of the mite communities, Leucaena was considered to be better than other agroforestry species in encouraging the growth of mite populations.'

Abstract: "A water resource accounting study has been carried out for a limestonemining area located in Thondamuthur block of Coimbatore district under Tamilnadu state in India. The major source of surface water in the region is south-west and north-west monsoons during July-August and October-November, respectively. During the winter season, groundwater levels range from 13 to 25 m below the surface whereas during the summer season it varies from 20 to 30 m. The thickness of the weathered zone ranges from 10 to 40 m and the depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to 55 m. The groundwater is generally potable. The average annual rainfall during the twelve-year period (1988\xe2\x80\x931999) is 590 mm. Out of the total rainfall, around 11% is lost as surface runoff, 10% is lost through evaporation and transpiration, 30% is utilized for consumptive used, 16% is absorbed as subsoil loss and remaining only 33% is stored as groundwater recharge. Again out of total groundwater recharge only 85% is utilizable groundwater. The annual utilizable groundwater resource available in the area is 79.220 million cubic metre (MCM). Whereas, total groundwater demand for the region is 68.922 MCM, and breakup of industrial, domestic and agricultural demands are 0.020, 5.956 and 62.946 MCM, respectively. Therefore, at present the stage of groundwater development or utilization for the area is around 87%, and falls under `Dark' category. The `Dark' category indicates that the utilization of groundwater is more than 85% of available groundwaterresource. This situation has to be controlled by immediate initiation ofsuitable measures for groundwater recharge. The identified recharge zonesin the block along with the recommended recharging methodology are summarized in this paper. The paper includes a comprehensive site description, status of the water resource and demand, identification of recharge zones and recharging techniques, and recommends a water supply augmentation strategy for enhancement of water resources in the region."

Abstract: 'The paper shows that isoresistivity contours for different depths, drawn from interpreted resistivity values, can indicate the location of underground lineaments. A comparison of the surface lineament map with the maps of isoresistivity contours for different depths shows that many of the underground lineaments recognised through the resistivity studies have surface expressions as lineaments. The underground lineaments allow large-scale migration of groundwater and can be used as sites for the artificial recharging of aquifers. It is concluded that the maps prepared from interpreted resistivity values derived by curve matching can give a better picture of the underground structures than the conventional maps prepared from apparent resistivity values.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing can be defined as the process of measuring the physical properties of distant objects using reflected or emitted energy [1]. Remote Sensing (RS) refers to the science of identification of earth surface features and estimation of their geo-biophysical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information [2, 3]. Remote Sensing data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods [4, 5].\n'

Abstract: 'Open-cast mining generates sediment in river systems at globally significant scales. One of the challenges in attributing measured sediment loads to upstream mining activities is establishing the source of sediments that are a mixture of natural and mining-based materials. The environmental magnetic data (mass-specific magnetic susceptibility, anhysteretic remanent magnetisation, isothermal remanent magnetisation and inter-parametric ratios) on 57 samples of suspended sediment from the Bhadra River in the Sahyadri (the Western Ghat) of India have been used in this study. Samples were collected upstream, adjacent to and downstream of Kudremukh, a mountainous and high rainfall site where the largest mechanised open-cast mine in south Asia was located. Graphical and multivariate analyses and modelling of the data show that on average ~29% of the river suspended load downstream of the mine is derived from mining and allied activities at Kudremukh although the mine occupies less than 5% of the catchment. The contribution of primary ore is the maximum (18%), followed by transitional hard weathered ore (7%) and weathered ore (4%). The model has done a fairly good job of unmixing; the sum of errors is <1 for 40 samples, 1\xe2\x80\x934,254 for five samples and >71,000 for four samples. Modelling of samples with small mass seems to produce large errors. This investigation demonstrates the utility of environmental magnetic data, which can be obtained in a simple and rapid manner, and the unmixing of such data in identifying the contribution of mining activities to the total suspended sediment load.'

Abstract: 'This study presents statistical analysis of hydrogeochemical data of the groundwater samples collected from the layered formations of the Cretaceous, Tertiary (Lower Cuddalore and Upper Cuddalore) and Quaternary in Pondicherry region, South India. It focuses on the sources, controls and geochemical processes occurring in these formations. The results obtained from statistical analysis of 11 important hydrochemical parameters indicate dissimilar elemental correlations among aquifers. Quaternary aquifer exhibit good correlations among ion pairs Ca+\xe2\x80\x93Cl\xe2\x88\x92 and Na+\xe2\x80\x93Cl\xe2\x88\x92 indicating source controls like salts from unsaturated zone, fertilizers, industrial wastes and also processes like ion exchange. Upper and lower Tertiary aquifers have good correlations among ions as Ca2+\xe2\x80\x93Mg2+\xe2\x80\x93Na+\xe2\x80\x93K+\xe2\x80\x93Cl\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x93HCO3 2\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x94H4SiO4 indicating dominant role of silicate rock weathering processes, while Cretaceous formation show high correlations among Ca+\xe2\x80\x93Mg2+\xe2\x80\x93SO4 2\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x93HCO3 \xe2\x88\x92 indicating carbonate and sulphate mineral contribution. High positive ion correlations among Na+\xe2\x80\x93K+\xe2\x80\x93Cl\xe2\x88\x92 observed in Cretaceous formation reflects contribution from marine sources. The study has also brought out the three major processes active in theses aquifers like parental, anthropogenic and mixing. The spatial distribution of the factor score for individual groundwater samples reveals the sources of the constituents that are in good agreement with those deduced from the geological and hydrogeological evidences. A conceptual geochemical model is developed to improve the understanding of this complex multi-layered aquifer system that would help the water authorities to plan for judicious exploitation of groundwater resources management without significantly hampering the groundwater quality.'

Abstract: 'The population structure of Labeo calbasu from 11 rivers belonging to the Indus, Ganges, Bhima, Mahanadi, and Godavari basins was investigated using allozyme marker systems. Seven out of 20 allozyme loci (35%) were polymorphic (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.99). Both probability and score tests indicated significant deviation of genotype proportions from Hardy\xe2\x80\x93Weinberg expectations at two loci, XDH* (Mahanadi, Bhima, and Godavari) and G6PDH* (Mahanadi). A pairwise genetic homogeneity test and F ST values indicated a low-to-moderate level (0.0515) of genetic structuring in the wild population of L. calbasu. AMOVA analysis also indicated moderate differentiation among the samples from different river basins. Analysis for genetic bottleneck was performed under the infinite allele model. The study revealed nine genetic stocks of L. calbasu from the natural population across Indian rivers. Evidence of genetic bottlenecks in some rivers was also revealed.'

Abstract: 'Conservation of biodiversity and mitigation of global warming are two major environmental challenges today. In this context, the relationship between biodiversity (especially plant diversity) and soil carbon (C) sequestration (as a means of mitigating global warming) has become a subject of considerable scientific interest. This relationship was tested for homegardens (HG), a popular and sustainable agroforestry system in the tropics, in Thrissur district, Kerala, India. The major objectives were to examine how tree density and plant-stand characteristics of homegardens affect soil C sequestration. Soil samples were collected at four depths (0\xe2\x80\x9320, 20\xe2\x80\x9350, 50\xe2\x80\x9380, 80\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0cm) from HG of varying sizes and age classes, and their total C content determined. Tree density and plant-stand characteristics such as species richness (Margalef Index) and diversity (Shannon Index) of the HG were also determined. Results indicated that the soil C stock was directly related to plant diversity of HG. Homegardens with higher, compared to those with lower, number of plant species, as well as higher species richness and tree density had higher soil carbon, especially in the top 50\xc2\xa0cm of soil. Overall, within 1\xc2\xa0m profile, soil C content ranged from 101.5 to 127.4\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. Smaller-sized HG (<0.4\xc2\xa0ha) that had higher tree density and plant-species density had more soil C per unit area (119.3\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921) of land than larger-sized ones (>0.4\xc2\xa0ha) (108.2\xc2\xa0Mg\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921). Soil C content, especially below 50\xc2\xa0cm, was higher in older gardens. The enhanced soil-C storage in species-rich homegardens could have relevance and applications in broader ecological contexts.'

Variation in dissolved oxygen content was from 2.46 to 6.47\xc2\xa0ml/l and suspended matter ranged between 0.03 and 1.05\xc2\xa0gm/l. Concentrations of nutrients viz. phosphates (0.71\xe2\x80\x932.38\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0at/l), nitrates (0.73\xe2\x80\x932.42\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0at/l), nitrites (0.07\xe2\x80\x930.98\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0at/l) and silicate (131.18\xe2\x80\x93298.18\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0at/l) also varied independently. The results of the study revealed that hydrographical conditions fluctuated moderately throughout the year.'

Abstract: 'This paper presents an overview of the use of lineaments in landslide hazard mapping. The lineaments are normally derived either from aerial photographs or satellite imagery. The relative advantages and disadvantages of digital image processing and manual (visual) lineament interpretation are discussed. Most researchers prefer the manual technique, despite the fact it is more time-consuming and subjective, as it allows a higher degree of operator control. Ways of increasing objectivity in the interpretation are suggested. It is hoped that lineament mapping will increasingly be incorporated in landslide hazard assessment hence the paper emphasizes the need for care and a proper understanding of these methods and their limitations.'

Abstract: 'The Puntius denisonii colloquially and more popularly referred to as Miss Kerala is a subtropical fish belonging to the genus Puntius (Barb) and family Cyprinidae. Two cell lines PDF and PDH were developed from the caudal fin and heart of P. denisonii, respectively. The cell lines were optimally maintained at 26\xc2\xb0C in Leibovitz-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A diploid count of 50 chromosomes at passage 50 was observed in both the cell lines. The high growth potential of the cell lines was reflected from the cell doubling time of 28 and 30\xc2\xa0h of PDF and PDH cell lines, respectively. The viability of the PDF and PDH cell lines was 70% and 76%, respectively, after 4\xc2\xa0mo of storage in liquid nitrogen (\xe2\x88\x92196\xc2\xb0C). The origin of the cell lines was confirmed by the amplification of 653\xc2\xa0bp fragments of cytochrome oxidase subunit I of mitochondrial DNA genes.'

Abstract: 'Digha coastal region in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal is potentially vulnerable to erosional hazard. The present study assessed the coastal erosion vulnerability along this 65\xc2\xa0km long coastal stretch located between Rasulpur (Midnapur) and Subarnarekha (Balasore) estuarine complex, which had been subjected to anthropogenic intervention. Multi-resolution Landsat satellite imagery were used for shoreline change study from 1972 to 2010. During this period, accretion was recorded updrift of artificial structures, viz, seawall, groin, pylons and jetties; while, extensive erosion was recorded in downdrift areas of these structures. Assessment was subsequently divided into four categories ranging from \xe2\x80\x9chigh erosion\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9caccretion\xe2\x80\x9d. Data from several sources were compiled to map landuse and human activities in the coastal zone. This map was divided into four categories, ranging from \xe2\x80\x9cvery high capital\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cno capital\xe2\x80\x9d landuse. Population density map of the surrounding coastal villages was generated using census data, and divided into four categories ranging from \xe2\x80\x9chigh density area\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cvery low density area\xe2\x80\x9d. Subsequently, coastal erosion vulnerability was assessed by combining coastal retreat with landuse type and population density in this study area using simple vector algebraic technique. Zones of vulnerability of different magnitude (viz., very high, high, moderate, and low) have been identified. Furthermore, calculation of \xe2\x80\x9cimminent collapse zone (ICZ)\xe2\x80\x9d shows that maximum values are around artificial structures and anthropogenic activities. The coastal erosion vulnerability map prepared from this study can be used for proper planning and management of this coastal region.'

Title: 'Environmental effects of river sand mining: a case from the river catchments of Vembanad lake, Southwest coast of India'

Abstract: 'Rivers in the southwest coast of India are under immense pressure due to various kinds of human activities among which indiscriminate extraction of construction grade sand is the most disastrous one. The situation is rather alarming in the rivers draining the Vembanad lake catchments as the area hosts one of the fast developing urban-cum-industrial centre, the Kochi city, otherwise called the Queen of Arabian Sea. The Vembanad lake catchments are drained by seven rivers whose length varies between 78 and 244\xc2\xa0km and catchment area between 847 and 5,398\xc2\xa0km2. On an average, 11.73\xc2\xa0million\xc2\xa0ty\xe2\x88\x921 of sand and gravel are being extracted from the active channels and 0.414\xc2\xa0million\xc2\xa0ty\xe2\x88\x921 of sand from the river floodplains. The quantity of instream mining is about 40 times the higher than the sand input estimated in the gauging stations. As a result of indiscriminate sand mining, the riverbed in the storage zone is getting lowered at a rate of 7\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0cm\xc2\xa0y\xe2\x88\x921 over the past two decades. This, in turn, imposes severe damages to the physical and biological environments of these river systems. The present paper deals with the environmental effects of indiscriminate sand mining from the small catchment rivers in the southwest coast of India, taking the case of the rivers draining the Vembanad lake catchments as an example.'

Title: 'Nature of light rain during presence and absence of bright band'

Abstract: 'This paper reports the evolution of rain drop size distribution (DSD) during bright band (BB) and no-BB (NBB) conditions of low intensity rainfall events as observed by a vertically pointing Micro Rain Radar (MRR) over Pune (18.58\xc2\xb0N, 73.92\xc2\xb0E), India. The BB is identified by enhanced radar reflectivity factor Z (dBZ) at the 0\xc2\xb0C isotherm. The gradient of hydrometeor fall velocity is found to be a good indicator in identifying the melting layer when enhanced radar reflectivity at melting layer is not prominent. The storm structures as observed by the MRR are compared with CloudSat observations that provide evidence of ice hydrometeor at ~\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x9260\xc2\xb0C with clear indication of BB at 0\xc2\xb0C. Storm heights at warmer than 0\xc2\xb0C are evident during NBB conditions from CloudSat. This suggests that warm rain processes are responsible for producing rain during NBB conditions. During BB conditions, bimodal DSDs below the melting layer are observed at lower altitudes. The DSDs of shallow warm precipitating systems of NBB conditions are monomodal at all the altitudes. Significantly, normalized DSDs are found to be bimodal for BB conditions, and monomodal for NBB conditions which confirm different dominant microphysical processes. It is found that the observed bimodal DSDs during BB conditions are mainly due to the collision, coalescence and break-up processes. During NBB conditions, number and size of large raindrops grow while reaching the ground without much breakup. The radar reflectivity and rainfall intensity R (mmh\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x891) relationship of the form Z\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0aR  b  are found out for BB and NBB conditions. Existing different microphysical processes lead to large coefficient in the Z\xe2\x80\x93R relationship with small exponent during BB conditions while during NBB conditions the coefficients are small with large exponents.'

Abstract: 'A study was carried out on seed characteristics of nine different tree species of six botanical families for germination and viability during three years, 2008\xe2\x80\x932009, 2009\xe2\x80\x932010 and 2010\xe2\x80\x932011. Average germination percentages after 5, 10 and 20\xc2\xa0days were 27.22, 55.56 and 69.44\xc2\xa0% for all nine species. Highest germination percentage was recorded in two species of bombacaceae, viz., Bombax ceiba (95\xc2\xa0%), followed by Ceiba pentandra L (30\xc2\xa0%). Rest of the species showed less than 30\xc2\xa0% germination after 5\xc2\xa0days of incubation. After 20\xc2\xa0days, seedling length was highest in B. ceiba, followed by Leucaena leucocphala with values of 16.20 and 16.05\xc2\xa0cm, respectively. Average seedling vigor index (SVI) was 59.08 after 5\xc2\xa0days, which increased regularly with values of 479.38 and 865.11 after 10 and 20\xc2\xa0days. Highest SVI was recorded in B. ceiba, following by Sterculia urens at all the stages after 5, 10 and 20\xc2\xa0days. Average viability was 91.22\xc2\xa0% among all species, with highest value of 94\xc2\xa0% for Albizia lebbeck. Two species, viz., C. pentandra and Delonix regia exhibited lowest viability of 80\xc2\xa0%. Root length/shoot length (RL/SL) ratio decreased with age from 9.86 at 5\xc2\xa0days after germination to 0.75 and 0.52 at 10 and 20\xc2\xa0days after germination, respectively. In general seeds were recalcitrant type. Knowledge on germination, pattern and viability is not only important for understanding community process but also for framing strategies for conservation of biodiversity and restoration of forests.'

Abstract: 'Madhus\xc5\xabdana Sarasvat\xc4\xab wrote several treatises on Advaita philosophy. His magnum opus is the Advaitasiddhi, written in order to reply to the keen objections moved by the Dvaitin Vy\xc4\x81sat\xc4\xabrtha\xe2\x80\x99s Ny\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81m\xe1\xb9\x9bta. Advaitasiddhi is verily a turning point into the galaxy of Ved\xc4\x81nta, not only as far as its replies are concerned, but also for the reutilization of earlier ved\xc4\x81ntic material and its reformulation by means of the highly sophisticated language of the new school of logic. This article is an attempt to contextualize Madhus\xc5\xabdana\xe2\x80\x99s works in a broader context through three looking glasses: (1) the analysis of how Madhus\xc5\xabdana refers to his own works, in order to reconstruct a relative chronology among them; (2) Madhus\xc5\xabdana\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to the tenets of the previous Advaita tradition, how much he is indebted to Vy\xc4\x81sat\xc4\xabrtha, how he quotes him and how he replies to him; (3) Madhus\xc5\xabdana\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with other textual traditions, mainly Vy\xc4\x81kara\xe1\xb9\x87a, P\xc5\xabrva M\xc4\xabm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x83s\xc4\x81 and Ny\xc4\x81ya.'

Abstract: 'The satellite digital vegetation index data has been correlated with the forest growing stock by fitting linear regression models. The goodness of fit was tested. The analysis showed that the vegetation index which is the ratio of reflectance of vegetation in near infrared band to red wave band of electromagnetic spectrum is highly correlated to forest growing stock and the same can be used to predict the volume in remote forest areas for quick assessment purpose. Implications for future forest inventory are discussed.'

Title: 'Arsenic speciation in polychaetes (Annelida) and sediments from the intertidal mudflat of Sundarban mangrove wetland, India'

Abstract: 'This paper documents the concentration of total arsenic and individual arsenic species in four soft-bottom benthic polychaetes (Perenereis cultifera, Ganganereis sootai, Lumbrinereis notocirrata and Dendronereis arborifera) along with host sediments from Sundarban mangrove wetland, India. An additional six sites were considered exclusively for surface sediments for this purpose. Polychaetes were collected along with the host sediments and measured for their total arsenic content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Arsenic concentrations in polychaete body tissues varied greatly, suggesting species-specific characteristics and inherent peculiarities in arsenic metabolism. Arsenic was generally present in polychaetes as arsenate (AsV ranges from 0.16 to 0.50\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921) or arsenite (AsIII ranges from 0.10 to 0.41\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921) (30\xe2\x80\x9353\xc2\xa0% as inorganic As) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV\xc2\xa0<1\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xa0%). Arsenobetaine (AB\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa016\xc2\xa0%), and PO4-arsenoriboside (8\xe2\x80\x9348\xc2\xa0%) were also detected as minor constituents, whilst monomethylarsonic acid (MAV) was not detected in any of the polychaetes. The highest total As (14.7\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 dry wt) was observed in the polychaete D. arborifera collected from the vicinity of a sewage outfall in which the majority of As was present as an uncharacterised compound (10.3\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 dry wt) eluted prior to AB. Host sediments ranged from 2.5 to 10.4\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg\xe2\x88\x921 of total As. This work supports the importance of speciation analysis of As, because of the ubiquitous occurrence of this metalloid in the environment, and its variable toxicity depending on chemical form. It is also the first work to report the composition of As species in polychaetes from the Indian Sundarban wetlands.'

Title: 'Molecular data in conjunction with morphology help resolve the Hemidactylus brookii complex (Squamata: Gekkonidae)'

Abstract: 'Molecular data are increasingly being used to resolve cryptic species complexes; however, subsequent formal species description and taxonomic revisions often remain incomplete. Given that most species are described based on morphology-based alpha taxonomy, one cannot resolve nomenclatural issues of species complexes without the aid of morphology. In this study, we examined the taxonomic status of a long-known human commensal and species complex, Hemidactylus brookii. To this end, samples of H. cf. brookii and related species were collected across India. We analyzed molecular as well as morphological data to resolve the taxonomy of this species complex. Seven deeply divergent, well-supported clades were recovered using the mitochondrial phylogeny, five of which were also retrieved in the nuclear tree. One of these consists of five morphologically distinct species of ground-dwelling Hemidactylus. The genetic distances across each clade of putative species of H. brookii sensu lato were comparable to that between morphologically distinct species of ground-dwelling Hemidactylus. Meristic characters such as number of precloacal-femoral pores, number of non-pore bearing scales interrupting the series of pored scales, dorsal pholidosis, and presence/absence of divided lamellae can be used to distinguish these putative species from each other. However, morphological characters of H. brookii sensu stricto did not correspond to any of the putative species studied. The study also revealed that the \xe2\x80\x9cH. brookii complex\xe2\x80\x9d in India includes two commensal species, Hemidactylus parvimaculatus and Hemidactylus murrayi. Furthermore, these two lineages have independently acquired adaptations that could have assisted them in exploiting human habitat. An identification key to diagnose species within this complex and rest of the Hemidactylus in India is proposed.'

Abstract: 'Groundwaters\n of the coastal region are significant and serve as a fragile ecosystem in the sedimentary terrain. The Pondicherry region is characterized by different geological formations of distinct geological epochs Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary. Ninety-three samples were collected from specific aquifers with respect to spatial distribution [Alluvium (31), Upper Cuddalore (13), Lower Cuddalore (13), Other Tertiary (7), Cretaceous (24) and Mixed\xe2\x80\x94multiple completion aquifer (5)]. The collected samples were analyzed for major ions Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3 \xe2\x88\x92, Cl\xe2\x88\x92, PO4 2\xe2\x88\x92, SO4 2\xe2\x88\x92, F and DOC. Stables isotopes of \xce\xb418O, \xce\xb4D and \xce\xb4 13C were also analyzed along with heavy metals like Al, Ba, Fe, Sr, Cd and Zn. The \xce\xb418O ranges between \xe2\x88\x926.85 and \xe2\x88\x922.15\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xb0, and \xce\xb4D ranges between \xe2\x88\x9243.94 and \xe2\x88\x9219.41\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xb0. The distribution of these environmental isotopes in groundwater of this layered aquifer sequence was also attempted. A comparison of the isotopic data with the rainfall, Local Meteoric Water Line with a equation of \xce\xb4D\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa07.398 * \xce\xb418O\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa05.067, Indian Meteoric Water Line and Global Meteoric Water Line was performed. The \xce\xb413C values for groundwater ranges from \xe2\x88\x925.3 to \xe2\x88\x9218.1\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xb0. The result indicates that the groundwater in the study area is mainly meteoric in origin, and few samples show evidence of evaporation. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a very important component in biogeochemical cycling of elements characterized by high susceptibility to leaching. The range of the DOC in the study area is 0\xe2\x80\x9316\xc2\xa0mg/L. Factor analysis was applied to classify the groundwater samples and to identify geochemical processes controlling groundwater geochemistry. The Alluvium aquifers show a complex hydrogeochemistry than the older aquifers. The major factor influencing the hydrogeochemistry of the region is rock\xe2\x80\x93water interaction and anthropogenic processes. Hence, metal mobility of the groundwater shows the correlation of metal bonding and DOC. The relation between the DOC and heavy metal concentration in the aquifers was also identified.'

Abstract: 'Assessment of possible sources that control the groundwater quality was carried out in the Cauvery deltaic region, India, since domestic and agricultural water requirements are largely met by groundwater abstraction. Major ion and bromide contents are high in groundwater in the coastal wells. Spatial and vertical distributions of ions reveal that the shallow wells and wells in coastal parts have high chloride, nitrate, ammonium and phosphate. Groundwater quality assessment was carried out using the prescribed limits of World Health Organization and Bureau of Indian Standards which indicates that 55\xc2\xa0% of samples are not fit for drinking. Integrated suitability map for drinking was created based on the concept that if the water sample exceeds any one of the standards by World Health Organization or Bureau of Indian Standards, the well is not fit for drinking. Groundwater quality for agricultural activities was assessed using electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, United States salinity laboratory diagram and Food and Agricultural Organization methods. According to Food and Agricultural Organization, 84\xc2\xa0% of samples are classified as low sodium water and are suitable for all crops and soils. It was found that the water quality in this area is affected by improper disposal of waste, sewage/drainage canals near the wells, irrigation return flow, application of agrochemicals and saline water intrusion in the coastal region. Further, integrated suitability map produced in this study will be useful for future groundwater development and planning in this area. The suitability map needs to be updated periodically for proper management plan to preserve the groundwater resource in this region.'

Abstract: 'Fluoride contamination in soil was studied in the vicinity of a hot spring in Nayagarh district of Orissa. Both bulk soil from 0 to 30\xc2\xa0cm depth and profile soils from 0 to 90\xc2\xa0cm depth were analyzed for total fluoride (F t ) and 0.01 M CaCl2 extractable fluoride (F ca ), major elements, pH, EC and Organic Carbon (OC). High concentrations of both F t  and F ca  were observed in the area surrounding the hot spring and the village of Singhpur. Principal factor analysis (PFA) on the parameters of the bulk soils suggests that two major chemical processes due to three factors, control the soil geochemistry of the area. Factor-1 contributes 37.11% of the total variance and is strongly loaded with Al, Si, Fe, F t and F ca , and explains the fluoride enrichment of the soil, whereas the second and the third factors contribute 16.6 and 12.2%, respectively and explain the controlling process of carbonate precipitation and soil alkalinity. Multiple regression analysis of the scores of the factors was performed to derive a fluoride contamination index in soil. The magnitude of the factor effect on the contamination index follows the order of Factor-1 > Factor-2 > Factor-3. The spatial distribution of the contamination index is used to classify the area into highly contaminated, moderately contaminated and uncontaminated zones.'

Abstract: 'Estimation of spatial plant distribution of a large area is very tedious and time consuming assignment. In this regard, herbaria of the world are supposed to be the excellent repositories of the plant collections for reference purpose. But many repositories of the world do not have the associated information of the collections and thus it becomes a muddle for future studies. The aim of this study is to know the extent of this mess. Therefore, spatial distribution of Berberidaceae members in NW Himalaya was studied through available herbarium data in three herbaria at Department of Botany, University of Jammu, Janaki Ammal Herbarium, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine and Herbarium, Department of Botany, Punjabi University. It is observed that the collected specimens in aforesaid herbaria are correctly identified; but simultaneously, proper collection sites and collection dates are not mentioned for some specimens. Therefore, it is difficult to recollect the species. This is also revealed that India harbours 04 genera (Berberis, Epimedium, Mahonia and Nandina) and 22 species of the Berberidaceae, out of which 02 (Berberis and Mahonia) are reported from the NW Himalaya.'

Abstract: ' The surface sediments of Vembanad Lake, a tropical estuary on the west coast of India, were analyzed for carbon (TC, TOC, TIC), nitrogen (TN), amino acids and two amino sugars. C/N ratios for the surface sediments vary from 1.0\xe2\x80\x9321.8, indicating terrestrial sources of organic matter. Various biogeochemical indicators based on amino acids such as Asp/\xce\xb2-ala and Glu/\xce\xb3-aba ratios revealed that the organic matter in the 5- to 10-cm surface sediments was fresh and had not undergone extensive degradation. However, the Gluam/Galam ratio for surface sediments of Vembanad Lake varies from 0.4\xe2\x80\x932.1, indicating the dominance of bacterial biomass in the sediments. Organic matter in the sediments was found to be highly reactive, with a reactivity index ranging from 2.4\xe2\x80\x937.4, suggesting rapid remineralization.'

Abstract: 'Population dynamics of the egg parasitoids of the tea mosquito bug, Helopeltis antonii was investigated between June 2010 and May 2013. Three species of egg parasitoids attacked Helopeltis spp. in cashew orchards viz. Telenomus cuspis Rajmohana and Srikumar, Chaetostricha sp. and Erthymelus helopeltidis Gahan. T. cuspis was the most abundant species and was recorded throughout the year with the exception of March and April. It showed the maximum parasitism rate during the monsoon (28.21\xc2\xa0%), exhibiting a significant and positive correlation with rainfall (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.33). The occurrence of Chaetostricha sp. and E. helopeltidis was occasional (1.80 and 2.25\xc2\xa0%, respectively) during December, showing a significant and negative correlation with the minimum temperature (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x920.63). The development time of T. cuspis was 20.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.13\xc2\xa0days. Longevity was significantly shorter for male (2.83\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.16\xc2\xa0days) than for female (4.52\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.11\xc2\xa0days). Elements of parasitoid foraging behaviour such as antennal drumming, ovipositor insertion, egg marking, walking and resting were also observed. The level of parasitism provided by T. cuspis suggests a good potential for biological control against Helopeltis spp.'
