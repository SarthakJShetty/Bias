Abstract: 'AbstractThe present paper studies, the progress in the research of nature inspired swarm robotics. Swarm robotics is a robotic technology inspired from the nature (natural swarms). In this, an artificial intelligence aided coordination approach is used for the self-organization and decentralization of multiple robots. Being a promising centralized approach with fault tolerance, redundancy and scalability potentials, they can even work when it is technically infeasible to set up the infrastructure required to control the robots in a centralized way. But the design of individual robot level practice to achieve a desired collective behavior is really difficult as it is hard to predict the simultaneous interactions between large numbers of individual robots. In order to explore the possibilities to make a better progress in this technology, the existing modeling, analysis methods and the challenges has to be studied first. Followed by this, a study on swarm communication and the hardware units including sensors and actuators was done. Further the existing swarm platforms are compared based on hardware detailing, advantages and limitations. This comparative study can pay way to a better design of a multi-robot system for the applications like rescue operation, surveillance, oil spills, military applications etc.'

Title: 'Efficient Strategy for Collective Navigation Control in Swarm Robotics\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: "AbstractIn swarm robotics, it is necessary to develop methods and strategies that guide the collective execution of tasks by the robots. The design of such tasks can be done considering it as a collection of simpler behaviors, called subtasks. In this paper, the Wave Swarm is presented as a general strategy to manage the sequence of subtasks that compose the collective navigation, which is an important task in swarm robotics. The proposed strategy is based mainly on the execution of wave algorithms. The swarm is viewed as a distributed system, wherein the communication is achieved by message passing among robot's neighborhood. Message propagation delimits the start and end of each subtask. Simulations are performed to demonstrate that controlled navigation of robot swarms/clusters is achieved with three subtasks, which are recruitment, alignment and movement."

Author: 'Nadia'

Abstract: 'AbstractDynamic task allocation in a robotic swarm is a necessary process for proper management of the swarm. It allows the distribution of the identified tasks to be performed, among the swarm of robots, in such a way that a pre-defined proportion of execution of those tasks is achieved. In this context, there is no central unit to take care of the task allocation. So any algorithm proposal must be distributed, allowing every, and each robot in the swarm to identify the task it must perform. This paper proposes a distributed control algorithm to implement dynamic task allocation in a swarm robotics environment. The algorithm is inspired by the particle swarm optimization. In this context, each robot that integrates the swarm must run the algorithm periodically in order to control the underlying actions and decisions. The algorithm was implemented on ELISA III real swarm robots and extensively tested. The algorithm is effective and the corresponding performance is promising.'

Abstract: 'AbstractNowadays, an approach for coordinating large numbers of autonomous robots, which is called as swarm robots, has becoming an important issue in robotics research. In swarm robot systems, each robot must cooperate with other robots in order to perform a given task. The main obstacle in swarm robot research is the cost of making robots. Building one robot with limited capabilities commonly has to spend substantial amount of money and certainly making robots for intelligent systems research need much more investment. In this paper, we would like to present the development of affordable mobile robot, but also having powerful capabilities and intelligence. The mobile robot is specifically designed and made to be used as a stand-alone or in swarm robot systems. It is essential that the mobile robot has learning ability to adapt the dynamic environments. Furthermore, for swarm robot systems, each mobile robot must be able to communicate with other robots in order to coordinate each other. In our research, we used differential drive model for mobile robot locomotion and then apply the model through Android smartphone based controller. The mobile robot was constructed by using two actuators on the right and left side, and one castor wheel which has no steering system and can move freely. The differences velocity between left and right actuators determines the direction and final position of the mobile robot. The angular velocity of two main actuators is set by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) parameter in IOIO board microcontroller. In our experiment, we showed that the capability of our robot in performing several movement tasks. We are sure that Android based robotic platforms are ideal candidates for affordable robotics for swarm robot system research.'

Abstract: "AbstractIn the original particle swarm optimization algorithm, particles\xe2\x80\x99 update is done synchronously. The whole swarm fitness is evaluated first before particle update process is conducted. Whereas in asynchronous update a particle is able to update its velocity and position after its fitness is evaluated. This caused the particle's search to be conducted with imperfect information. However, asynchronous update is useful in field such as swarm robotics search problem, where the robots can move continuously based on the available information without waiting for the whole swarm. Hence this paper looks into the differences between synchronous and asynchronous PSO and its application in swarm robotics search."

Abstract: 'AbstractThis study examined how path planning of intelligent mobile robot could be enhanced by utilizing simplified swarm optimization (SSO) in working environment with irregular obstacles. The conceptual framework of this study was driven from an inspiration of communal behavior of birds flocking and fish schooling. This conceptual framework was supported by swarm intelligence, which is one of the famous research areas in the field of computational swarm intelligence such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Significant observations have been made that mobile robots are significantly affected by path planning problems, and solutions are established how to tackle these problems and numerous weaknesses. Therefore, this study proposes an effective solution which can yield a high quality and efficient mobile robots. The SSO technique was adapted in order to provide an effective solution to the discussed weaknesses. The designed simulation algorithm results showed that SSO does not have assemble in the closed work interface where no path between the initial and the destination points. Obtained results show that when the particle\xe2\x80\x99s path gets into an obstacle area, it is automatically repositioned to an obstacle free area. Autonomy and energy efficiency within the particles are also discussed.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe problem of dispatching discipline choice when managing programs are linked into unified multi-loop computer control system is considered. It is shown that a problem of control of such a system may be reduced to the problem of evaluation of states both robot and controller. In multi-circuit computer control systems time intervals of residence of robot in any state depends on both time complexity of control algorithm and dispatching discipline. Two simplest disciplines of most common use are investigated: the cyclic dispatching and foreground (quasi-stochastic) one. With use the formalism of semi-Markov process models of functioning of control programs under investigated dispatching disciplines are worked out. Mathematical relationships for time of return to any state of semi-Markov process and time between switches are obtained. The parameters obtained are essential for choice the efficient regimes of data processing when control of robots.'

Title: 'Inference algorithm for teams of robots using local interaction'
Author: 'Vitaly'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918300784
Abstract: 'AbstractOne of the possible approaches to the technical implementation of logical inference in robot groups is considered in paper. The problem is that the usual implementations of the inference mechanism, for example, which are used in expert systems, are difficult to implement to robots that work in a team. It is due to the fragmented knowledge of each robot about the environment where they perform the tasks assigned, the need to exchange data during the inference and monitor this process, etc. In addition, the presence of an inference subsystem may be necessary for emergence of emergent properties in a group of robots. The output subsystem can be used to solve a variety of tasks, for example, choosing the most preferred strategy for the whole collective, building a general picture of the world, planning, etc. In this regard, the paper presents some mechanisms that allow the inference in the logic of predicates of the first order for a team of robots whose interaction with each other is exclusively local in nature. The inference procedure is carried out in the team of robots, which form a special structure, called a static swarm.'

Abstract: 'AbstractProcess planning of multi-robot cells is usually a manual and time consuming activity, based on trials-and-errors.

Abstract: 'AbstractWe are developing an approach for predicting emergent swarm behavior. The swarms consist of agents tasked with tagging targets in simple grid worlds. These swarms are interesting because of their emergent behavior. The path length distributions capture the local probabilistic information. We use networks of simple probabilistic graphs of this local information to model the collective behavior. These networks of local models predict the proportion of agents in each region at a given step. This allows us to predict the effectiveness of tagging in a large grid world given choices of local action by individual agents. We explain the approach, its limitations, and future directions of research.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm design and mission application is a burgeoning area of research. The applications of swarm technology to unmanned systems are in the infancy of realization, although clear benefits from the enhanced capabilities can be easily envisioned for commercial and government missions including persistent search, long-term monitoring, sensor data collection, object retrieval, and offensive attack missions. Designing a UAV swarm architecture without considering the mission doctrine is imprudent, as is developing a mission doctrine without understanding the unique capabilities of swarm technology. This paper provides a literature review of current UAV swarm design architectures, most of which employ bottom-up methods with little consideration for an intended operational mission. The proposed top-down framework and modeling approach is focused on developing a modular UAV swarm playbook-type architecture by decomposing a subset of US Navy missions, and developing tactics that can be applied to those missions and support future missions. The framework proposed herein is derived from a consolidation of heuristics from the model-based systems engineering, robotics, human systems integration, biology, and computer science disciplines. The goal of this framework is to provide a standard methodology for designing and operating swarm unmanned systems that will meet the performance requirements for military missions. In this paper, an integrated framework for designing a UAV swarm system with swarm mission doctrine as a primary design factor is presented.'

Author: 'Idris'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215098618307110
Abstract: 'AbstractIn this study, an adapted Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed for the inverse kinematic solution of the robot that is designed for reduction in fracture treatment with external fixator and it is applied to this robot, which has six degrees of freedom. In the classic PSO algorithm, all of the particles are directed to the searched target. Until the specified criterion is reached, all particles have a value for each step from the beginning until the reached point and these values are updated taking into account the previous. Therefore, sometimes particles can jam locally if the number set in the solution is too high.In proposed method, if the criterion is not complied with at the end of a certain number of steps PSO algorithm is stopped and the final point that is reached is assumed as the new beginning point and the process is repeated through repositioning until the criterion is complied with. This proposed method has been tested on a robot with 3 linear and 3 rotation axes and much better results have been obtained in comparison with classical PSO.'

Abstract: 'AbstractFinding an optimal trajectory from an initial point to a final point through closely packed obstacles, and controlling a Hilare robot through this trajectory, are challenging tasks. To serve this purpose, path planners and trajectory-tracking controllers are usually included in a control loop. This paper highlights the implementation of a trajectory-tracking controller on a stepper motor-driven Hilare robot, with a trajectory that is described as a set of waypoints. The controller was designed to handle discrete waypoints with directional discontinuity and to consider different constraints on the actuator velocity. The control parameters were tuned with the help of multi-objective particle swarm optimization to minimize the average cross-track error and average linear velocity error of the mobile robot when tracking a predefined trajectory. Experiments were conducted to control the mobile robot from a start position to a destination position along a trajectory described by the waypoints. Experimental results for tracking the trajectory generated by a path planner and the trajectory specified by a user are also demonstrated. Experiments conducted on the mobile robot validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for tracking different types of trajectories.'

Author: 'Fatih'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn this paper, we study how flocking affects the accuracy and speed of individuals in long-range \xe2\x80\x9cmigration\xe2\x80\x9d. Specifically, we extend a behavior that can generate self-organized flocking in a swarm of robots to follow a homing direction sensed through the magnetic field of the Earth and evaluate how the final points reached by the flock are scattered in space and how the speed of the flock is affected. We propose that four factors influence the performance of migration, in the proposed behavior, namely: (1) averaging through heading alignment behavior, (2) disturbances caused by proximal control behavior, (3) noise in sensing the homing direction, and (4) differences in the characteristics of the individuals. Systematic experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of these factors using both physical and simulated robots. The results show that although flocking reduces the speed of an individual, it increases the accuracy of \xe2\x80\x9cmigration\xe2\x80\x9d for flocks that are larger than a certain size.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWork solutions are proposed for problems of leader definition and role distribution in homogeneous groups of robots. It is shown that transition from a swarm to a collective of robots with hierarchical organization is possible using exclusively local interaction. The local revoting algorithm is central to the procedure for choice of leader while redistribution of roles can be achieved by a wave method. The basis for this approach is the static swarm model, which is characterized by the absence of a set control center and represents the network fixed at some time interval as a set of locally interacting agents.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe use of UAVs and robots in the commercial purposes has increased significantly in last few years. Along with the research being conducted for both UAVs and mobile robots individually throughout the research community, there has been a significant amount of work going in the field of the relationship of UAVs and mobile robots.

None of the goals is shared by more than one robots. UAV will be acting as the leader of robots and will have the bird-eye view of the environment. The UAV will calculate an efficient path plan for every robot that will help the robot to reach the goal by avoiding the static obstacles as well as the inter-robot collision during the movement of robots. We have simulated our algorithm in software using Python as well as MATLAB and also have compared two pathfinding algorithms wiz.

Abstract: 'AbstractA number of recent studies address systems of mobile autonomous robots from a distributed computing point of view. Although such systems employ robots that are relatively weak and simple (i.e., dimensionless, oblivious and anonymous), they are nevertheless expected to have strong fault tolerance capabilities as a group. This paper studies the partitioning problem, where n robots must divide themselves into k size-balanced groups, and examines the impact of common orientation on the solvability of this problem. First, deterministic crash-fault-tolerant algorithms are given for the problem in the asynchronous full-compass and semi-synchronous half-compass models, and a randomized algorithm is given for the semi-synchronous no-compass model. Next, the role of common orientation shared by the robots is examined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the partitioning problem to be solvable are given in the different timing models. Finally, the problem is proved to be unsolvable in the no-compass synchronous model.'

Abstract: 'AbstractPath planning problem for large number of robots is a quite challenging problem in mobile robotics since their control and coordination becomes unreliable and sometimes unfeasible. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been demonstrated to be a useful technique in the field of robotic research. This paper discusses an optimal path planning algorithm based on a Dynamic Distributed Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (D2PSO). The purpose of this approach is to find collision free optimal paths using two local optima detectors. This would add diversity to the population and hence avoid stagnation problem. The results show that the D2PSO has a better ability to get away from local optimums than the distributed PSO (dPSO). Simulations prove that this methodology is effective for every robot in multi-robot framework to discover its own proper path from the start to the destination position with minimum distance and no collision with obstacles.'

Abstract: 'AbstractClassical Q-learning takes huge computation to calculate the Q-value for all possible actions in a particular state and takes large space to store its Q-value for all actions, as a result of which its convergence rate is slow. This paper proposed a new methodology to determine the optimize trajectory of the path for multi-robots in clutter environment using hybridization of improving classical Q-learning based on four fundamental principles with improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) by modifying parameters and differentially perturbed velocity (DV) algorithm for improving the convergence. The algorithms are used to minimize path length and arrival time of all the robots to their respective destination in the environment and reducing the turning angle of each robot to reduce the energy consumption of each robot. In this proposed scheme, the improve classical Q-learning stores the Q-value of the best action of the state and thus save the storage space, which is used to decide the Pbest and gbest of the improved PSO in each iteration, and the velocity of the IPSO is adjusted by the vector differential operator inherited from differential evolution (DE). The validation of the algorithm is studied in simulated and Khepera-II robot.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWe propose an efficient solution for finding a collision-free path in a Three-Dimensional environment with dynamic obstacles for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Path Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Three Dimensional Dynamic Environment is considered a challenging task in the field of robotics.

A swarm of particles is made to co-ordinate with each other for optimal path planning. The simulation is run in Python and the viability of the algorithm according to path-cost, time and number of expanded nodes is measured.'

Author: 'Mohit Ranjan'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper has given a fresh approach of hybridization of invasive weed optimization (IWO) with improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) to obtain the optimal path for each robot in multi-robots system in a non-stationary environment. The main emphasis of the algorithm is to lessen the path length and time taken by all robots to arrive at the respective destined target in the cluttered environment. Each robot takes independent decisions of their own to evaluate the next positions from their current position in the global map using proposed hybrid IWO-IPSO. The proposed approach embedded the spatial dispersion method of IWO with motion mechanism of IPSO called IWO-IPSO. The main aim of the hybridization is to maintain a good balance between intensification and diversification and avoid local minima value because of adopting co-evolutionary techniques to update the velocity and particle positions with IPSO simultaneously. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been validated through simulation and real platform. Finally, the experimental and simulation results of IWO-IPSO for multi-robot path planning are weighed against with results obtained by IPSO, IWO in a analogous environment to make sure the integrity of the algorithm is maintained. The results obtained from simulation on top of Khepera environment justifies that, the proposed IWO-IPSO performs superiorly than IPSO and IWO with respect to arrival time, energy utilization during travel of path, optimal path length and deviation of path.'

Abstract: "AbstractThe conventional robotic assistive device was based on pre-programmed functions by the robot expert. This makes it difficult for stroke patients use it effectively due to difficulty of torque setting that is suitable for the user movement. Electromyography (EMG) signal measures the electrical signal of muscle contraction.The EMG-based robotics assistive technology would enable the stroke patients to control the robot movement according to the user's own strength of natural movement.This paper discusses the mapping of surface electromyography signals (sEMG) to torque for robotic rehabilitation. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been applied as a control algorithm for a number of selected mathematical models. sEMG signals were determined as input data to the mathematical model where parameters of the mathematical model were optimized using PSO. Hence, the good correlated estimated torque as output was obtained."

Abstract: 'AbstractSpherical rolling mechanisms (SRMs) exhibit a number of advantages with respect to wheeled and legged mechanisms. In fact if the SRM is combined with the power of bouncing mechanism, it will produce an exciting phenomena that can be contributed to applications such as security surveillance, search and rescue. There is not much research done in both fields, especially in the bouncing mechanism. In fact to the best of authors\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge no of research has been done on integrating both mechanism to produce a spherical system that is capable of rolling and bouncing, which can produce a very significant mobile robot. Therefore, this research deals with the modeling and development of a bouncing spherical robot using computational intelligent technique, i.e. Particle Swarm Optimization technique (PSO). A 3D virtual prototype of a spherical robot was developed in Visual Nastran as a platform for input and out data acquisition. Different simulations environment have been created, such as the free fall bouncing, shooting up and projectile type of environment to investigate the bouncing profile affected by different forces. The data obtained were then used for system identification using PSO technique with mean square error (MSE) of 0.0004%. The transfer function representing the bouncing mechanism of the sphere robot was then obtained. Next, the prototype of the sphere robot with bouncing capability was developed. Open loop tests have been conducted and the results show that the hardware developed can produce the bouncing mechanism at its promising capability. Future works need to be conducted to re-visit the hardware, particularly on the body of the sphere robot such that maximum bouncing can be achieved.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMobile robotics research is an emerging area since last three decades. The present research on mobile robotics addresses the problems which are mainly on path planning algorithm and optimization in static as well as dynamic environments. A detailed review has been made in the broad field of mobile robotic research especially focussing on the path planning strategy in various cluttered environments, their advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies/methods have been highlighted. The path planning strategy of mobile robots can be categorised as Classical Methods and Heuristic Methods. Further subcategorized as (i) Analytical Methods, (ii) Enumerative Methods, (iii) Evolutionary Methods and (iv) Meta-Heuristic Methods. Each of these aforesaid methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, the main weakness arises from the fact that, analytical methods are too complex for intangible applications, whereas the enumerative methods are anxious by the extent of the search space. On the other hand, when search space is too large in path planning strategy, many evolutionary methods have been shown to be ineffective. To overcome these drawbacks, meta-heuristic methods have been fascinating considerably in this broad field of research. Many techniques are developed in path planning for mobile robot worldwide, however, the most commonly used techniques are presented here for further study.'

Abstract: 'AbstractA framework for incorporating a swarm intelligent system with the Dynamic Data Driven Application System (DDDAS) is presented. Swarm intelligent systems, or artificial swarms, self-organize into useful emergent structures that are capable of solving complex problems, but are difficult to control and predict. The DDDAS concept utilizes repeated simulations of an executing application to improve analytic and predictive capability by creating a synergistic feedback loop. Incorporating DDDAS with swarm applications can significantly improve control of the swarm. An overview of the DDDAS framework for swarm control is presented, and then demonstrated with an example swarm application.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper presents the control strategy of two degrees of freedom (2DOF) rigid robot manipulator based on the coupling of artificial neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with sliding mode control (SMC). Initially SMC with proportional integral derivative (PID) sliding surface is adapted to control the robot manipulator. The parameters of the sliding surface are obtained by minimizing a quadratic performance indices using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Variations of SMC i.e. boundary sliding mode control (BSMC) and boundary sliding mode control with PID sliding surface (PIDBSMC) are developed for optimized performance index. Finally an ANFIS adaptive controller is proposed to generate the adaptive control signal and found to be more robust with regard to disturbances in input torque.'

Abstract: 'AbstractWith the increasing use of humanoid robots in several sectors of industrial automation and manufacturing, navigation and path planning of humanoids has emerged as one of the most promising area of research. In this paper, a navigational controller has been developed for a humanoid by using fuzzy logic as an intelligent algorithm for avoiding the obstacles present in the environment and reach the desired target position safely. Here, the controller has been designed by careful consideration of the navigational parameters by the help of fuzzy rules. The sensory information regarding obstacle distances and bearing angle towards the target are considered as inputs to the controller and necessary velocities for avoiding the obstacles are obtained as outputs. The working of the controller has been tested on a NAO humanoid robot in V-REP simulation platform. To validate the simulation results, an experimental platform has been designed under laboratory conditions, and experimental analysis has been performed. Finally, the results obtained from both the environments are compared against each other with a good agreement between them.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAccording to the features of movements of humanoid robot, a control system for humanoid robot walking on uneven terrain is present. Constraints of stepping over stairs are analyzed and the trajectories of feet are calculated by intelligent computing methods.

Title: 'Synchronous Robots vs Asynchronous Lights-Enhanced Robots on Graphs\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'Mattia'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066116300202
Abstract: "AbstractIn this paper, we consider the distributed setting of computational mobile entities, called robots, that have to perform tasks without global coordination. Depending on the environment as well as on the robots' capabilities, tasks might be accomplished or not.In particular, we focus on the well-known scenario where the robots reside on the nodes of a graph and operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles. In one cycle, a robot perceives the current configuration in terms of robots positions (Look), decides whether to move toward some edge of the graph (Compute), and in the positive case it performs an instantaneous move along the computed edge (Move).We then compare two basic models: in the first model robots are fully synchronous, while in the second one robots are asynchronous and lights-enhanced, that is, each robot is equipped with a constant number of lights visible to all other robots. The question whether one model is more powerful than the other in terms of computable tasks has been considered in [Das et al., Int.'l Conf. on Distributed Computing Systems, 2012] but for robots moving on the Euclidean plane rather than on a graph.We provide two different tasks, and show that on graphs one task can be solved in the fully synchronous model but not in the asynchronous lights-enhanced model, while for the other task the converse holds. Hence we can assert that the fully synchronous model and the asynchronous lights-enhanced model are incomparable on graphs. This opens challenging directions in order to understand which peculiarities make the models so different."

Abstract: 'AbstractAn efficient path planning algorithm is required for the robot to move in a complex known and unknown environments. In the present research, the authors made an attempt to develop a path planning algorithm, that is, fast marching method (FMM) for the biped robot to move in a static environment. Once the path planning algorithm is developed, a simulation study is conducted to determine the path for the environment that consists of different number of obstacles that from different configurations for the terrain. The path planning algorithm is successfully seen to derive collision-free shortest paths in all the cases. Further, experiments are conducted on a real biped robot to test the effectiveness of the algorithm in deriving on-line collision-free path for the robot.'

Abstract: "AbstractMobile olfaction and odour source localisation has become a noticeable research field in recent years. Current developments in mobile robots and the dynamic nature of environments that the robot performs its tasks have increased robot's computation requirements. Behaviour based robot has been lauded to be robust and cost effective to counter the earlier mentioned problems.

The functionality and advantages of using the testbed were highlighted. Furthermore, various mapping techniques were implemented for both single and multiple robot system which has the potential to aid odour source localisation task carried by the robot. Finally, a simple behaviour based approach was implemented on a robot with sense of smell and sight in dynamic conditions to evade the time-consuming and rigidity of algorithm based approach. The enhancements of this approach on the different odour source localisation task were highlighted. A Braitenberg vehicle was implemented for odour source localisation."

Author: 'J\xc3\xbcrgen'

Abstract: 'AbstractSwarm systems are based on intermediate connectivity between individuals and dynamic neighborhoods. In natural swarms self-organizing principles bring their agents to that favorable level of connectivity. They serve as interesting sources of inspiration for control algorithms in swarm robotics on the one hand, and in modular robotics on the other hand. In this paper we demonstrate and compare a set of bio-inspired algorithms that are used to control the collective behavior of swarms and modular systems: BEECLUST, AHHS (hormone controllers), FGRN (fractal genetic regulatory networks), and VE (virtual embryogenesis). We demonstrate how such bio-inspired control paradigms bring their host systems to a level of intermediate connectivity, what delivers sufficient robustness to these systems for collective decentralized control. In parallel, these algorithms allow sufficient volatility of shared information within these systems to help preventing local optima and deadlock situations, this way keeping those systems flexible and adaptive in dynamic non-deterministic environments.'

Title: 'Optimal time-jerk trajectory planning of 6 axis welding robot using TLBO method'
Author: 'Amruta'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918310123
Abstract: 'AbstractIn this paper an efficient approach for optimal offline trajectory planning of welding robot is presented. The welding path is considered as a continuous path compromising of a no. of polynomial segments. During robotic welding process, the end effector is deviated from the weld seam path due to production of jerk. This results in yielding of weld defects after welding operation is performed. Therefore, for robotic welding operation, smooth trajectory planning has been set as priori. For this the objective function has been defined terms of both time and squared jerk. By minimizing the jerk, the continuity of acceleration and velocity can be achieved by which leads to smooth robotic motion. An efficient meta-heuristic method, Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm has been used to get optimized results. It has been observed that the jerk has been reduced very significantly with optimal results of time.'

The objective is to minimize the makespan criterion. We propose a hybrid combinatorial particle swarm optimization algorithm (HCPSO) as a resolution technique for solving this problem. At the initialization, different priority rules are exploited. Experimental study and statistical analysis were performed to select the most adapted one for this problem. Then, the swarm behavior is tested for solving a combinatorial optimization problem such as a sequencing problem under constraints. Finally, an iterated local search algorithm based on probabilistic perturbation is sequentially introduced to the particle swarm optimization algorithm for improving the quality of solution. The computational results show that our approach is able to improve several best known solutions of the literature. In fact, 76 solutions among 120 were improved. Moreover, HCPSO outperforms the compared methods in terms of quality of solutions in short time requirements. Also, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated according to a real-world industrial problem.Graphical abstract'

Title: 'Obstacle Avoidance and Navigation Planning of a Wheeled Mobile Robot using Amended Artificial Potential Field Method'
Author: 'Priyanka'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918310214
Abstract: 'AbstractTrajectory planning is a prime method in the research on mobile robot navigation. Sampling-based algorithms can generate trajectories which help the robot to reach the target avoiding obstacles. In this proposed work, an Enhanced Artificial Potential Field (E-APF) generates the trajectories for mobility of mobile robots and simultaneously guarantees the effectiveness and continuity of the trajectory. Aiming at the problem that the classical APF cannot adapt to the complex trajectory planning and fall a as prey to the local optimal solution, E-APF method is proposed for Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) route planning. In this research work, this method does not consider the influence of traditional attraction and repulsive forces. The repulsive potential is built by repulsive function for discretizing outline of an arbitrarily shaped obstacle with their boundary points. This process describes the workspace of the wheeled mobile robot more precisely. The reliability is proved for most of the cases by discussing the convergence of this proposed technique. Finally, an efficient obstacle avoidance based action has been performed in the chosen navigable trajectory. Trajectories that have been generated using the proposed E-APF satisfy constraints approach of the direction on both the starting and goal points. Consequently, the trajectories that are generated by the Wheeled Mobile Robot are geometrically and dynamically feasible. Simulation results performed confirm the viability of the proposed E-APF algorithm that it can be effectively utilized in trajectory planning of wheeled mobile robots and can be applied in real-time scenarios.'

Title: 'Swarm intelligence in fish? The difficulty in demonstrating distributed and self-organised collective intelligence in (some) animal groups'
Author: 'Christos C.'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635716302881
Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2The mechanisms for improved cognitive performance in larger animal groups are reviewed.\xe2\x80\xa2Swarm intelligence is improved performance resulting from decentralised, self-organised information exchange in groups.\xe2\x80\xa2Experimental studies using fish shoals often favour one mechanism or another.\xe2\x80\xa2Swarm intelligence is rarely explicitly demonstrated in fish shoals.\xe2\x80\xa2Guidance for future empirical work is given.AbstractLarger groups often have a greater ability to solve cognitive tasks compared to smaller ones or lone individuals. This is well established in social insects, navigating flocks of birds, and in groups of prey collectively vigilant for predators. Research in social insects has convincingly shown that improved cognitive performance can arise from self-organised local interactions between individuals that integrates their contributions, often referred to as swarm intelligence. This emergent collective intelligence has gained in popularity and been directly applied to groups of other animals, including fish. Despite being a likely mechanism at least partially explaining group performance in vertebrates, I argue here that other possible explanations are rarely ruled out in empirical studies. Hence, evidence for self-organised collective (or \xe2\x80\x98swarm\xe2\x80\x99) intelligence in fish is not as strong as it would first appear. These other explanations, the \xe2\x80\x98pool-of-competence\xe2\x80\x99 and the greater cognitive ability of individuals when in larger groups, are also reviewed. Also discussed is why improved group performance in general may be less often observed in animals such as shoaling fish compared to social insects. This review intends to highlight the difficulties in exploring collective intelligence in animal groups, ideally leading to further empirical work to illuminate these issues.'

Abstract: "AbstractSwarm robot has been studied for last few decades because it possesses robustness, scalability and flexibility characteristics as compared to other types of robotic system. One of the swarm robots research areas includes a pattern formation. This paper presents an investigation of hydrodynamic effect (i.e. viscous drag) on the swarm Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) while performing pattern formation based on leader-follower control approach. The study specifically focus on the hydrodynamic effect of V-shape pattern formation as naturally observed in flying method of migrating birds. This study is important to ensure stability of the pattern formation while swarm of ASVs navigate on the water's surface. The parameters of interest are relative distance and relative angle between the ASV's leader and follower. Simulation results show that as the distance between the ASVs increases, the drag effect on the followers are decreases. It is also observed that, as the angle between leader and follower increases, the drag effect experiences by the follower ASVs decreases up to a certain value of angle before increasing again. However, the drag effect encountered by the leader is continuously decreases as the angle increases except at the initial state."

Title: 'Optimal Path Planning of Mobile Robot Using Hybrid Cuckoo Search-Bat Algorithm'
Author: 'Mbl'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918310093
Abstract: 'AbstractThe mobile robot path planning depends on sensing the data, map building and planning the path according to the prescribed environment. Many researchers have followed different techniques to get the optimal path. In the Earlier days Mathematical model has been developed to get the optimal path but the result obtained was very poor. After that, so many Soft computing techniques have been developed, but the major drawback is that they are more time to find the optimal path. Sometimes these algorithms fall in local optima during execution. This paper Deals with mobile robot path planning using two nature inspired meta-heuristic algorithms namely cuckoo-search and bat algorithm in the unknown or partially known environment. Cuckoo search is based on the parasitic behaviour of the cuckoo, and the bat algorithm is based on the Echolocation behaviour of the bats. The best qualities in the cuckoo-search and the bat algorithm are combined to obtain the optimal path. Proposed method takes less time to reach the target as compared to individual algorithms. The efficiency of this work has been tested in Matlab environment.'

A prototype system for parallel calculating of plans using high performance computing hardware is presented. A comparison of the optimized plans with a greedy approach is shown for different buildings and different sizes of robot teams. Finally the evaluation of the approach on real mobile robots is described.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe aim of this paper is to compare the performances of new fuzzy fractional order (FO) PID (fuzzy PI\xce\xbbD\xc2\xb5) controller with integer order fuzzy PID and PID controllers for controlling redundant robotic system for trajectory tracking problems. A five-degree of freedom (5-DOF) redundant manipulator is an MIMO, and extremely non-linear system. The performances of the controlled system are poorly affected by the presence model uncertainties and external disturbances. Thus, controller design for redundant robot system is difficult job for controller designer. The tuning of each controller\xe2\x80\x99s parameters is completed with artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization techniques. For investigating the effectiveness, the robustness testing is also investigated for model uncertainties and disturbance rejection. After many numerical simulations and comparison with conventional controller i.e. fuzzy PID and PID controllers, it is found that fuzzy PI\xce\xbbD\xc2\xb5 controller can not only promise best trajectory tracking but also meliorate the plant robustness for model uncertainties and disturbance rejection.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnderground mining is beset with numerous problems such as ground movement (fall of roof/sides), inundation, air blast, etc.; apart from gas explosions and dust explosions that are restricted to coal mines. Whatever may be the cause and type of accident or the extent of damage caused, it is a horrendous task for the rescue team to reach the trapped miners. The accident/irrespirable zone contains increased levels of harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and explosive gases like methane apart from a deficiency of Oxygen. The entire gallery or roadway is filled with dust and smoke, or water in case of inundation, hindering the visibility of rescue personnel. Thus, it is not an ideal situation for the rescue team to perform the operations. The first few hours after the disaster are the critical moments that could be the difference between life and death of the trapped miners. Hence, the ideal solution in such cases would be to deploy a wireless robot equipped with various gas sensors and cameras to aid visibility even in extremely low light conditions. This paper reviews some notable examples from the past and highlights important requirements for rescue robots along with some limitations encountered in the design of such robots.'

Title: 'Acceleration of the Multilayer Network Operator Method Using MPI for Mobile Robot Team Control Synthesis\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe paper is devoted to the problem of machine-made synthesis of control for robotic teams. The goal of synthesis is to find a multidimensional control function that depends on the current states of all robots. The synthesised control function provides any time the optimal control values to allow each robot achieving the objectives with the best value of functional quality. The approach is based on multilayer network operator method that belongs to a symbolic regression class. Formations of multi-robot systems require individual robots to satisfy their kinematic equations while constantly maintaining inter-robot dynamic constraints. Verification of these dynamic constraints on each iteration of the evolutionary algorithm greatly increases the computational costs of the numerical synthesis. In the paper we propose to accelerate existing designs through taking advantage of newest programming tools of MPI framework for automatic parallelization. Experiments show that our approach reduces greatly computational time.'

Abstract: 'AbstractToday, VLSI technology has taken a fundamental role in developing most of the high-tech electronic circuits. Even though VLSI design is renowned for its smaller size, lower cost, lower power, high reliability and high functionality, the design process takes long time and produces high risk. So, to obtain the knowledge regarding the different contributions on VLSI design, about 52 papers on the design of VLSI using optimization are reviewed here. Accordingly, VLSI design optimization is analyzed through different bio-inspired algorithms and the performance measures of different VLSI experimentations are compared. Further, various improvements on Self-Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO) and VLSI design optimization, without the adoption of bio-inspired algorithms, are examined. Additionally, the floor planning problem of VLSI is considered and reviewed. Eventually, this paper provides the diverse research gaps and challenges in VLSI design, which may be helpful for the authors and the philosophers to contribute for further research.'

Abstract: 'AbstractAutonomous mobile robot navigation is one of the most emerging areas of research by using swarm intelligence. Path planning and obstacle avoidance are most researched current topics like navigational challenges for mobile robot. The paper presents application and implementation of Firefly Algorithm (FA) for Mobile Robot Navigation (MRN) in uncertain environment. The uncertainty is defined over the changing environmental condition from static to dynamic. The attraction of one firefly towards the other firefly due to variation of their brightness is the key concept of the proposed study. The proposed controller efficiently explores the environment and improves the global search in less number of iterations and hence it can be easily implemented for real time obstacle avoidance especially for dynamic environment. It solves the challenges of navigation, minimizes the computational calculations, and avoids random moving of fireflies. The performance of proposed controller is better in terms of path optimality when compared to other intelligent navigational approaches.'

Title: 'Path Planning for Visually Impaired People in an Unfamiliar Environment Using Particle Swarm Optimization\xe2\x98\x86'

Abstract: 'AbstractExploring a new environment is a huge challenge for the visually impaired. Hence there is a need for a system that is able to assist them safely during their journey. Here, in this paper, we propose a path planning with predetermined waypoints method using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. This method computes shortest possible path given the predetermined waypoints from initial position to final position. By using predetermined waypoints which is a collection of coordinates along the pedestrian walkaway, a resulting accessible pedestrian path could be offered to the visually impaired. The system consists of a destination selection process and path planning process. For the destination selection process, a list of available places is given and the user will select the places that they want to visit from the list. The path planning process calculates path length between all nodes which includes predetermined waypoints, start point and final destination using Euclidean distance formula. The PSO algorithm will optimise possible shortest route by minimizing the total cost for path length. The simulation analyses of the proposed method have shown promising results of optimal route for different destinations. Results from this paper will be used further to explore the potential development of path guidance system for the visually impaired people by allowing them to travel independently in an unfamiliar environment.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn view of the fact that various resources are shared as services globally today in the manufacturing industry, the assessment and optimization for manufacturing capability of human-robot collaborative disassembly is the premise to realize the aggregation and optimization of the disassembly services, and provides the best basis for the optimal scheduling in the workshop. While human are the most basic manufacturing resource and industrial robots (IRs) are the most advanced, we establish a set of complete manufacturing capability assessment system and assessment model for human-robot collaborative disassembly in this paper. For the reason that most of the capability assessment method before ignored the data source selection of the assessment object, only used real-time data or historical data, this paper fuses the historical data and real-time data through manifold algorithm to get more accurate results. On this basis, we assess the manufacturing capability of human, robots, human-robot collaboration using the improved method combining PCA and Grey correlation degree method and AHP in disassembly process. Finally a case study is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.'

Title: 'Robotic Optimal Assembly Sequence Using Improved Cuckoo Search Algorithm'
Author: 'Gunji Bala'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918309852
Abstract: 'AbstractThe demand for manufacturing newer products are increasing day-by-day, keeping this demand in mind many modern manufacturing processes have been evolved to meet the demand and supply the product in time. Even though many modern methods have been evolved, still there is lack in time to meet the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s requirements. This is due to assembly, which takes 20% of cost in manufacturing. To do effective assembly, optimal sequence is required; achieving the optimal assembly sequence is a difficulty process because it is one of them Non Probabilistic (NP) hard combinatorial problems. Achieving an effective optimal assembly sequence involves more than one objective function to develop the fitness equation (number of directional changes, gripper changes, time of assembly etc.), which converts the problem into discrete optimization problem. At the starting stages of assembly planning, researchers implemented mathematical models to achieve the feasible solution. These methods performs very poorly when comes to large part assemblies. Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are evolved to solve the Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) Problems. Performances of these methods are quite impressive in solving ASP problems, but most of these algorithms fall in local optimal during execution. More over these methods consumes more time for getting optimal solution especially for the more part assemblies. Keeping the above difficulties in mind, in this paper an Improved Cuckoo Search (ICS) algorithm is implemented to obtain the optimal solution. The proposed algorithm is compared by considering two assemblies (wall rack assembly and eccentric milling machine) with the algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Hybrid Ant Wolf Algorithm (HAWA). The results of the different algorithms are compared in terms of number of iterations and fitness values with the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the compared algorithms.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper investigates the relative performances of PSO variants when used to solve inverse kinematics. Inverse kinematics is a key issue in robotics; for problems such as path planning, motion generation or trajectories optimization, they are classically involved. In the specific case of articulated robotics, inverse kinematics is needed to generate the joint motions, correspondent to a known target position. Articulated systems are very important in humanoid robotics, since arms and legs belong typically to this kind of mechanisms. In this paper the IK-PSO, Inverse Kinematics PSO, is applied to a double link articulated system. A statistical analysis is conducted to survey the convergence and relative performances of the main PSO variants when applied to solve IK; the PO variants tested are: Inertia weight PSO, Constriction factor PSO, linear decreasing weight and two simplified PSO variants.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) may become the future of military aviation as technology advances, especially sensors and miniaturization techniques. Currently, however, UAVs are controlled individually and require many resources, including ground-based pilots, to function. In our project, we attempt to explore how to remedy this using a Dynamic Data-Driven Application System (DDDAS) to control a group, or swarm, of UAVs. DDDAS takes real data and injects it into a running simulation, as well as allowing the running simulation to influence what real data is gathered, and as such is an ideal system to control real UAVs. We describe here how we created a testbed system that allowed two simulations to communicate data to one another using DDDAS principles, as well as the beginnings of incorporating commercially-available UAVs into the system.'

Abstract: 'AbstractTo improve the grinding quality of robotic belt grinding systems for the workpieces with complex shaped surfaces, new concepts of the dexterity grinding point and the dexterity grinding space are proposed and their mathematical descriptions are defined. Factors influencing the dexterity grinding space are analyzed. And a method to determine the necessary dexterity grinding space is suggested. Based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, a strategy to optimize the grinding robot structural dimensions and position with respect to the grinding wheel is put forward to obtain the necessary dexterity grinding space.

According to simulation results, if the blade is placed within the dexterity grinding space, only one gripper and one grinding machine are needed to grind its complex shaped surfaces.'

Abstract: "AbstractCARIL (Context-Augmented Robotic Interaction Layer) is a human-robot interaction system that leverages cognitive representations of shared context as a basis for a fundamentally new approach to human-robotic interaction. CARIL gives a robot a human-like representation of context and an ability to reason about context in order to adapt its behavior to that of the humans around it. This capability is \xe2\x80\x9caction compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d A prototype CARIL implementation focuses on a fundamental form of action compliance called non-interference -- \xe2\x80\x9cnot being underfoot or in a human's way\xe2\x80\x9d. Non-interference is key for the safety of human-co-workers, and is also foundational to more complex interactive and teamwork skills. CARIL is tested via simulation in a space-exploration use-case. The live CARIL prototype directs a single simulated robot in a simulated space station where four simulated astronauts are engaging in a variety of tightly-scheduled work activities. The robot is scheduled to perform background tasks away from the astronauts, but must quickly adapt and not be underfoot as astronaut activities diverge from plan and encroach on the robot's space. The robot, driven by CARIL, demonstrates non-interference action compliance in three benchmarks situations, demonstrating the viability of the CARIL technology and concept."

Title: 'Swarm Theory Applied To Air Traffic Flow Management'
Author: 'Sergio'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050912006965
Abstract: 'AbstractThe goal of air Traffic Flow Management (TFM) is to balance demand against capacity in order to reduce inefficiencies. As an optimization problem TFM poses a number of difficult challenges. From the airline perspective the solutions should minimize the aggregate delay time relative to the scheduled time that is used by airlines to drive their operations. TFM must take into account air traffic control restrictions used to maintain aircraft separation and changes in capacity due to weather disruptions. In current operations TFM is done based on a centralized approach that relies on predictions and that does not integrate airline preferences. Combinatorial optimization techniques to solve the multi-objective traffic flow optimization problem are not practical; the vast number of variables and the exceedingly large Pareto front associated with the solution space generates a combinatorial explosion that makes the approach completely intractable. This paper presents a different approach to TFM, inspired in swarm theory, that converts pilots into goal seeking agents that individually find local solutions to the optimization problem and as a whole the collective action of agents creates emergent behavior that naturally tends to converge on its own to a Pareto efficient state.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn this paper we address exploration algorithm in flat experimental environment with colored objects for multi robots system. The aim of exploration in unknown environment is finding target points like mine detection in outdoor environment without any positioning device. Two algorithms were investigated in this paper one is frontier based random search algorithm and the second is efficient algorithm based on segmentation strategy. To improve efficiency, each robot had to go to different regions to avoid cumulating robots in one region. Constructed maps for all four regions could be shared and navigation could be done more effectively. For constructing map robot can use on built range finder sensor or using vision based systems. Also the algorithm using segmentation strategy is using frontier base algorithm for exploring divided area. Both algorithm implemented and analyzed in Player/Stage simulation. The result was compared and showed the efficiency of the designed algorithm based segmentation strategy. In simulation this algorithm is tested with different number of robots to achieve better view of efficiency for proposed algorithm in different type of environment like harsh environment as possibility of losing some robots.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThough much work on coalition formation and maintenance exists from the standpoint of abstract agents, this has not yet translated well to the realm of physically grounded robots. Most multi-robot research has focused on pre-formed teams, with little attention to the formation and maintenance of the team itself. While this is plausible in forgiving domains, it fails rapidly in challenging environments where equipment is lost or broken easily, such as urban search and rescue. This paper describes the team management elements of a framework for coordinating a changing collection of heterogeneous robots operating in complex and dynamic environments such as disaster zones. Our framework helps a team to reshape itself to compensate for lost or failed robots, including adding newly-encountered robots or additions from other teams, and also allows new teams to be formed dynamically starting from an individual robot. We evaluate our framework through an example implementation where robots perform exploration in order to locate victims in a simulated disaster environment.'

Three controllable factors of the turning process consisting of cutting speed, depth of cut and feed rate were incorporated. Taguchi design of experiments method was used to arrange the experimentation task. The developed response surface models were then employed with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize the cutting conditions. PSO program gives the minimum values of the considered criteria and the corresponding optimal cutting conditions.'

Abstract: 'AbstractIn recent years, thanks to the low cost of deploying, maintaining an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system and the possibility to operating them in areas inaccessible or dangerous for human pilots, UAVs have attracted much research attention both in the military field and civilian application. In order to deal with more sophisticated tasks, such as searching survival points, multiple target monitoring and tracking, the application of UAV swarms is forseen. This requires more complex control, communication and coordination mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are difficult to test and analyze under flight dynamic conditions. These multi- UAV scenarios are by their nature well suited to be modeled and simulated as multi-agent systems. The first step of modeling an multi-agent system is to construct the model of agent, namely accurate model to represent its behavior, constraints and uncertainties of UAVs. In this paper we introduce our approach to model an UAV as an agent in terms of multi-agent system principle. Construction of the model to satisfy the need for a simulation environment that researchers can use to evaluate and analyze swarm control mechanisms. Simulations results of a case study is provided to demonstrate one potential use of this approach.'

Title: 'Performance Comparison of Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization in Constrained Optimization'

Abstract: 'AbstractOptimization appears in many aspects of engineering problems. There are quite numbers of modern optimization algorithms proposed in the last two decades to solve optimization problems. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) are among the well-known modern optimization algorithms. This paper presents a comparative study for min-max constrained optimization using PSO and DE. Here, the constrained optimization is represented by some selected standard benchmark functions. A new constraint handling and stopping criterion technique is also adopted in the optimization algorithm. Generally, in terms of repeatability and the quality of the obtained solutions, DE outperforms PSO.'

Title: 'A \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamic\xe2\x80\x9d approach to multi-robot cooperative localization\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'Yotam'

Abstract: 'AbstractWe propose a new approach to the simultaneous cooperative localization of a very large group of simple robots capable of performing dead-reckoning and sensing the relative position of nearby robots. In the last decade, the use of distributed optimal Kalman filters (KF) to address this problem has been studied extensively. In this paper, we propose to use a very simple encounter based averaging process (denoted by EA). The idea behind EA is the following: every time two robots meet, they simply average their location estimates.We assume that two robots meet whenever they are close enough to allow relative location estimation and communication. At each meeting event, the robots average their location estimations thus reducing the localization error. Naturally, the frequency of the meetings affects the localization quality. The meetings are determined by the robots\xe2\x80\x99 movement pattern. In this work we consider movement patterns which are \xe2\x80\x9cwell mixing\xe2\x80\x9d, i.e. every robot meets other robots and eventually all of the robots frequently. For such a movement pattern, the time course of the expected localization error is derived. We prove that EA is asymptotically optimal and requires significantly less computation and communication resources than KF.'

Title: 'Optimization of an Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems by Swarm Intelligence\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'Simon'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705815005251
Abstract: 'AbstractAutomated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) need to execute complex combinatorial and sorting tasks. In this study we have shown how to plan AS/RS using multiple objective ant colony optimisation (ACO). The distribution of products in the AS/RS is based on the factor of inquiry (FOI), product height (PH), storage space usage (SSU) and path to dispatch (PD). The factor of inquiry for any product can be adjusted during the storage process in regard to actual market requirements. In order to reduce space consumption and minimise investment costs we chose an AS/RS with no corridors and one single elevator for multiple products. Results show that the expected distribution of products was reached and that ACO can be successfully used for planning automated storage systems.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe paper presents the integration and experiments with a pilot cell including a traditional machine tool and an innovative robot-swarm cooperative conformable support for aircraft body panels. The pilot was installed and tested in the premises of the aircraft manufacturer Piaggio Aerospace in Italy. An original approach to the support of the panels is realized: robots with soft heads operate from below the panel; they move upward the panel where manufacturing is performed, removing the sagging under gravity and returning it to its nominal geometry; the spindle of amilling machine performs the machining from above.'

Title: 'Optimal probabilistic ring exploration by semi-synchronous oblivious robots'
Author: 'St\xc3\xa9phane'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439751300443X
Abstract: 'AbstractWe consider a team of k identical, oblivious, and semi-synchronous mobile robots that are able to sense (i.e., view) their environment, yet are unable to communicate, and evolve on a constrained path. Previous results in this weak scenario show that initial symmetry yields high lower bounds when problems are to be solved by deterministic robots.In this paper, we initiate research on probabilistic bounds and solutions in this context, and focus on the exploration problem of anonymous unoriented rings of any size n. It is known that k=\xce\x98(logn) deterministic robots are necessary and sufficient to solve the problem, provided that k and n are coprime. By contrast, we show that four identical probabilistic robots are necessary and sufficient to solve the same problem, also removing the coprime constraint. Our positive results are constructive.'

Title: 'A Comparison of the Manufacturing Resilience between Fixed Automation Systems and Mobile Robots in Large Structure Assembly\xe2\x98\x86'
Author: 'Spartak'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827116311957
Abstract: 'AbstractThe modern manufacturing industry is undergoing major transformations due to global competition and rapidly changing market demands. Traditional systems with rigid structures are very difficult to reconfigure every time a change in production is required. A promising alternative to these is seen in mobile, self-organising manufacturing systems, where self-deploying and independent entities such as mobile robots are used to facilitate a more reconfigurable assembly process. In addition, an integral part of manufacturing is the transportation of components within the manufacturing environment. Conveyor systems are often unsuitable for moving components that are large, heavy or awkward, making them difficult to use in large structure assembly. Currently, such components are commonly transported by cranes to dedicated automation systems which are seen as expensive and unadaptable. In this paper we investigate the differences in resilience to variations between a set of mobile robots and the widely accepted fixed automation systems under different conditions. Therefore, instead of transporting components or parts to manufacturing equipment we analyse the potential benefits of transporting the equipment to the large parts. By means of simulations, the two systems are compared to one-another in scenarios of identical part arrival times and part processing capacities. Assuming equal production rates, we assess their ability to respond to (1) rush orders, (2) fluctuating arrival times and (3) production mix variations. Currently, there are no specific algorithms for process control of such mobile systems. For this reason we apply the First-In-First-Out task-selection rule. We present a comparison of resilience measures between the systems.'

Abstract: 'AbstractLitter in public places is a serious problem. Not only because of the obvious dirtiness, but also because litter attracts more litter and can cause the winding down of an area leading to large negative financial and social consequences. To avoid this, public areas have been kept clean by humans. In this paper, we apply systems architecting and engineering techniques and among others a tool from TRIZ in a multidisciplinary student project. Goal is to develop a Litter Collecting Robot for operation in public places. Through an investigation of the litter problem and subsequent development of a product vision, we plan four scenarios for robotic cleaning. The paper treats the litter problem, the architecting phase, and will show innovative technical details, including a working integrated result: a proof of principle of the robot. The project was executed by students from various disciplines, supervised by two University staff members. On a meta-level \xe2\x80\x93regarding systems design and engineering\xe2\x80\x93 the combination of systems architecting and engineering principles, TRIZ tools, FunKey architecting and multidisciplinary communication will be treated.'
