'Variation in human skin pigmentation evolved in response to the selective pressure of ultra-violet radiation (UVR). Selection to maintain darker skin in high UVR environments is expected to constrain pigmentation phenotype and variation in pigmentation loci. Consistent with this hypothesis, the gene MC1R exhibits reduced diversity in African populations from high UVR regions compared to low-UVR non-African populations. However, MC1R diversity in non-African populations that have evolved under high-UVR conditions is not well characterized. '

'The Cicadoidea fauna of Wallacea, New Guinea and Melanesia is in great majority of Oriental origin, but shows high endemism at the generic and specific levels. In general the patterns of distribution of cicadas in this eastern archipelagic part of the Oriental region quite closely reflect the changing positions of land in past ages, perhaps more distinctly than in many other groups of insects because cicadas are less dispersive.'

'The anthropogenic plutonium isotopes are important geochemical tracers for environmental studies. The distributions and sources of the Pu isotopes in water column or sediments of the North Pacific have been intensively studied. However, knowledge on the distribution of Pu isotopes in sediments of the Central Pacific, when available, is limited. To study the composition of Pu isotopes in the ocean, thus to identify the sources of radioactive pollution, sediment core samples were collected in the Central Pacific by R/V Hakuho Maru in the KH-04-5 cruise. The activity concentrations of 239+240Pu and the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio were determined using a sector-field inductively coupled mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) combined with a high efficiency sample introduction system (APEX-Q). Possible sources and sedimentation behavior of Pu isotopes are discussed.'

'The Malayo-Oceanic tropics have long been regarded as a center for plant domestication, but archaeology has as yet contributed little direct evidence of the processes of domestication in prehistory. Recent excavations of Lapita culture sites in the Mussau Islands dating to 1600\xe2\x80\x93500 B.C. have yielded the first significant assemblage of preserved seeds and other floral remains representing 20+ taxa. Nearly all of these are tree crops of widespread importance in Malayo-Oceanic cultivation systems. These materials confirm that the Lapita culture, responsible for the initial human settlement of much of the southwestern Pacific, included developed arboriculture in its economic system.'

'We conducted 1-year-long mooring observations four times below 2000\xc2\xa0m, slightly south of the equator (2\xc2\xb039\xe2\x80\xb2 to 4\xc2\xb035\xe2\x80\xb2S) at 162\xc2\xb0E in the Melanesian Basin in order to detect the southward deep western boundary return current crossing the equator. Contrary to our initial expectation of the deep flow scheme in the equatorial western boundary region, the observed results indicated a fairly complicated flow configuration. We analyzed the results with the help of a high-resolution model simulation. The ensemble average of the horizontal flow at each level near the deep western boundary indicates a significant westward flow at 2000 and 2250\xc2\xa0m, with an insignificant southward component at 2500 and 2750\xc2\xa0m. The annual mean meridional transports are very small (>1\xc2\xa0Sv) and insignificant, with an ensemble-averaged value of 0.3\xc2\xa0Sv (southward) \xc2\xb10.4\xc2\xa0Sv at most. Combining this with high-resolution model results, it is deduced that the southward transport of the deep western boundary current (DWBC) leaving the equator may be smaller than those obtained by low-resolution models, because of trapping of its fairly large fraction in the equatorial zone. Annual-scale flow patterns are classified into several categories, mainly based on the meridional-flow dominating or the zonal-flow dominating pattern. A case of the meridional-flow dominating patterns may possibly capture an annual-scale variability of DWBC, because its meridional transport variation, though somewhat weak, is consistent with that simulated. The zonal-flow dominating regime includes two types: long-lasting, almost steady westward flows and long-term zonal flow oscillations. The former seems to comprise well-known zonally elongated and meridionally narrow structures of the zonal flow beneath the thermocline in the equatorial region. The ensemble-averaged flow mentioned above is dominated by this type at the upper two levels 2000 and 2250\xc2\xa0m, with total westward transport of 1.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.7\xc2\xa0Sv. The latter type seems to be a manifestation of the vertically propagating equatorial annual Rossby waves.'

'Laboratory and field investigations were carried out to investigate the nature and role of the male pheromone emitted by the Dynast beetle Scapanes australis and to develop a mass trapping technique against this major coconut pest in Papua New Guinea. We report the biological data obtained from natural and synthetic pheromone, previously described as an 84:12:4 (w/w) mixture of 2-butanol (1), 3-hydoxy-2-butanone (2), and 2,3-butanediol (3). EAG recordings from natural and synthetic pheromone and a pitfall olfactometer were poorly informative. In contrast, extensive field trapping trials with various synthetic pheromone mixtures and doses showed that 1 and 2 (formulated in polyethylene sachets in 90:5 v:v ratio) were necessary and sufficient for optimum long-range attraction. Beetles were captured in traps baited with racemic 1 plus 2, with or without a stereoisomer mixture of 3 (2.5- to 2500-mg/day doses). Plant pieces, either sugarcane or coconut, enhanced captures by the synthetic pheromone, which was active alone. Traps with the pheromone caught both sexes in a 3:2 female\xe2\x80\x93male ratio. A pheromone-based mass trapping led to the capture of 2173 beetles in 14 traps surrounding 40 ha of a cocoa-coconut plantation. The captures followed a log-linear decrease during the 125-week trapping program. The role of the male pheromone and its potential for crop protection are discussed.'

'It is the contention of this paper that some progress in alleviating the social and environmental problems which are beginning to face Papua New Guinea can be achieved by supporting traditional Melanesian values through maintaining the customary system of communal land tenure. In accordance with this aim, I will proceed to contrast certain Western attitudes towards \xe2\x80\x9cindividual freedom\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cselfinterested behaviour\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cindividual and communal interests\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprivate ownership\xe2\x80\x9d with attitudes and values expressed in the traditional Melanesian approach. In order to demonstrate the latter, I will briefly touch upon the phenomenon of \xe2\x80\x9cwantokism\xe2\x80\x9d and indicate how the Melanesian values associated with this concept find their locus in the system of \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary communal ownership\xe2\x80\x9d. Subsequently, I will describe how the emergence of a cash economy and the attachment to Western gadgetry and products have effected injury to the environment and undermined values which have previously maintained Melanesian social cohesion. While admitting that little can be done to eradicate the desire for cash and the products it can buy, I suggest that Melanesian communities and the environment itself would receive more protection if future development in Papua New Guinea embraced a system which incorporated certain of the traditional Melanesian values through the preservation of the communal form of land tenure. Ultimately, I suggest a way in which customary communal land tenure can be integrated into the established Anglo-Australian legal system.'

"The Pacific Islands or Oceania, typically subdivided into Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, have witnessed a virtual explosion of archaeological research, as indicated by this review of the past 5 years' literature. Most recent work centers on one or more of six major themes. Two themes are concerned with the movement of people into the Pacific region: the discovery of Pleistocene-age sites in island Melanesia and the search for early assemblages evidencing Austronesian dispersals. Substantial efforts have also focused on reconstructing prehistoric economic behavior and on assessing the impacts that colonizing human populations had on isolated and fragile island ecosystems. In the realm of social archaeology, Oceanic studies have contributed to understanding the long-term dimensions of interisland exchange and to the rise of complex, hierarchical sociopolitical systems, especially chiefdoms."

'The study of different ethnic groups living in the same physical environment provides the opportunity to examine interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus. In rural New Caledonia, the prevalence of diabetes was higher in part-Polynesians than in Melanesians: males \xe2\x80\x94 6.6 versus 0.5%; females \xe2\x80\x94 6.3 versus 3.5% respectively. The prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes) was 11.5 and 15.7% in part-Polynesian males and females, respectively, and 4.7 and 9.2% in Melanesian males and females. Mean age and degree of obesity in these ethnic groups were sufficiently similar to suggest that these factors played no significant role in the difference in diabetes prevalence. Furthermore, adjustment of relative risk of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes for age and obesity indicated that the modest differences between groups were not responsible for the observed variation in diabetes prevalence. The differences in prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes between Melanesians and part-Polynesians may be genetically determined, although the role of certain environmental factors other than obesity, e.g. differences in physical activity or qualitative aspects of diet, cannot be excluded.'

'Swath bathymetric, sonar imagery and seismic reflection data collected during the SOPACMAPS cruise Leg 3 over segments of the Vitiaz Trench Lineament and adjacent areas provide new insights on the geometry and the stuctural evolution of this seismically inactive lineament. The Vitiaz Trench Lineament, although largely unknown, is one of the most important tectonic feature in the SW Pacific because it separates the Cretaceous crust of the Pacific Plate to the north from the Cenozoic lithosphere of the North Fiji and Lau Basins to the south. The lineament is considered to be the convergent plate boundary between the Pacific and Australian Plates during midde to late Tertiary time when the Vitiaz Arc was a continuous east-facing are from the Tonga to the Solomon Islands before the development of the North Fiji and Lau Basins. Progressive reversal and cessation of subduction from west to east in the Late Miocene-Lower Plioene have been also proposed. However, precise structures and age of initiation and cessation of deformation along the Vitiaz Trench Lineament are unknown.'

'Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD) is three fold more common in New Caledonia (NC) than in metropolitan France and many IMD cases (35.7\xc2\xa0%) are due to Y and W135 serogroups. The purpose of our study was to identify IMD risk factors in NC.'

'Petrographic examination of prehistoric Pacific potsherds in thin section allows robust distinctions to be drawn between indigenous temper sands derived from islands where sherds were collected and exotic temper sands derived from other islands, except that calcareous temper sands of reef detritus are undiagnostic of origin. Ceramic transfer or movement of ceramic raw materials from island to island can be detected because small islands serve as virtual point sources of noncalcareous terrigenous sands, and local island geology is controlled by systematic and well-known geotectonic patterns. Prehistoric Oceanian pottery was made locally on multiple islands, rather than being dispersed from a discrete number of ceramic centers, but limited ceramic transfer was widespread within nearly all island groups. As temper analysis is independent of ceramic typology, sherd tempers in common with obsidian artifacts and other manuports provide unambiguous physical evidence for migration, trade, or exchange within and between island groups.'

"Increasingly, archaeologists are recognizing cultural anthropological work in New Guinea as an important source of ethnographic analogy for understanding the initial stages of cultural evolution. This article critically reviews the literature on leadership in contact-era New Guinea. It is intended as an introduction both to different theoretical interpretations of leadership, as these have developed from Marshal Sahlins's Big-man archetype to the present, and to the primary literature on the topic. It points to several implications for archaeological theory, identifies a number of problems in the ethnography and theory of contact-era New Guinea leadership, and concludes with a brief guide to deploying the ethnographic and theoretical literature."

'The wetlands of 21 countries and territories of the Pacific Islands region are reviewed: American Samoa, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna. The regions\xe2\x80\x99 wetlands are classified into seven systems: coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangrove swamps, riverine, lacustrine, freshwater swamp forests and marshes. The diversity of species in each of these groups is at near global maxima at the west of the region, with decline towards the east with increasing isolation, and decreasing island size and age. The community structure is unique in each country, and many have endemic species with the habitat isolation that epitomises this island region. There remain, however, some serious gaps in basic inventory, particularly in freshwater biodiversity. Threats to wetlands include introduced freshwater species, loss of wetlands adjacent to urban growth, downstream effects of mining and land clearance, and over-use of mangrove, seagrass and coral reef resources by predominant subsistence economies that remain in this region. Only five countries are signatories to the Ramsar convention on wetlands, and this only recently with seven sites. Wetland managers have identified the need for community education, baseline surveys and monitoring, better legislation and policy for wetland management, and improved capacity of local communities to allow the wise use of their wetlands.'

"New bathymetric and geophysical data were collected in the region east of the island of Malaita during the SOPACMAPS II cruise of the French research vessel L'ATALANTE. This region, part of the Malaita Anticlinorium was interpreted as a piece of oceanic crust from the Ontong Java Plateau obducted over the old Solomon Islands arc during collision between the Pacific and Australian plates. It has been generally accepted that convergent motion between the Australia and Pacific plates since the Late Miocene was absorbed exclusively along the San Cristobal trench, southwest of the Solomon Islands Arc."

'The dispersal of the Austronesian language family from Southeast Asia represents the last major diaspora leading to the peopling of Oceania to the East and the Indian Ocean to the West. Several theories have been proposed to explain the current locations, and the linguistic and cultural diversity of Austronesian populations. However, the existing data do not support unequivocally any given migrational scenario. In the current study, the genetic profile of 15 autosomal STR loci is reported for the first time for two populations from opposite poles of the Austronesian range, Madagascar at the West and Tonga to the East. These collections are also compared to geographically targeted reference populations of Austronesian descent in order to investigate their current relationships and potential source population(s) within Southeast Asia. Our results indicate that while Madagascar derives 66.3% of its genetic makeup from Africa, a clear connection between the East African island and Southeast Asia can be discerned. The data suggest that although geographic location has influenced the phylogenetic relationships between Austronesian populations, a genetic connection that binds them beyond geographical divides is apparent.'

'The Solomon Sea Plate was widely developed during late Oligocene, separating the proto-West Melanesian Arc from the proto-Trobriand Arc. Spreading in the Bismarck Sea and in the Woodlark Basin resulted from interaction between the Pacific and Australian Plates, specifically from the collision of the proto-West Melanesian Arc with north New Guinea, which occurred after arc reversal. This model explains the extensive Miocene, Pliocene, and Quaternary volcanism of the Papua New Guinea mainland as it related to southward subduction of the Trobriand Trough. Our interpreted plate motions are concordant with the geological evidence onshore and also with complex tectonic features in the Solomon Sea Basin Region.'

'The available geological, gravimetric, and seismological data suggest that island arcs, deep-sea trenches, and seismofocal zones of Indonesia (as a part of the Alpine-Indonesian mobile belt) differ significantly from structures of the same names of the Pacific ring proper. Thus, seismofocal zones of the ring are characterized by the stress-strain conditions of subhorizontal across-strike compression at depths of 0\xe2\x80\x93400 km. In seismofocal zones of the mobile belt, such conditions exist only in the depth interval \xe2\x88\xbc(0\xe2\x80\x9340) km. At depths of about 40 to 400 km, lengthening (the T axis) is oriented along the dip-updip direction of a zone, whereas shortening (the P axis) is oriented along the strike of a seismofocal zone or, if individual P axes are not well ordered in this depth interval, they are scattered near the plane normal to the lengthening axis. We relate these distinctions to the fact that the mobile belt inherits a geosynclinal, rather than oceanic, basin that cannot be regarded as a huge bay of the paleo-Pacific. The aforementioned data imply that SW Melanesia (the New Guinea Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, and Solomon Islands) includes the recent Bismarck geosynclinal zone located on the strike of the Indonesian segment of the Alpine-Indonesian mobile belt.'

'The Solomon arc lacks subduction-associated volcanism in its eastern part. This anomalous absence arose from the collision of the submarine Ontong Java Plateau with the Solomon arc about 8 m.y. ago and a consequent flip in subduction. Collision was most forceful over the eastern half, so that the new, north-plunging slab of Indo-Australian plate remained in collisional contact with the thick oceanic crust (>40 km) and lithosphere of the Ontong Java Plateau along a face of cooled depleted refractory mantle; there is no intervening asthenospheric wedge, and therefore no magma production.'

In this study, one of the first in a forensic environment, we used the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) for generating complete mitogenome sequences via stand-alone massively parallel sequencing and describe a standard data validation practice.'

'Data are presented from the first four groups studied in a longrange investigation of human ecology in the Solomon Islands. The groups varied in habitat, way of life, genetic background, and exposure to Western influence. Coverage of residents in designated hamlets was 78% for Kwaio, Malaita Island; 91% for Nasioi, Bougainville Island; and over 95% for both Lau and Baegu of Malaita. In all, 1626 persons were studied: 256 Nasioi, 443 Kwaio, 442 Lau, and 485 Baegu. All four groups were demographically \xe2\x80\x9cyoung,\xe2\x80\x9d with a high ratio of persons under 15 to those over 45 years of age, but a significant proportion lived to old age. Nutrition was adequate, though low in protein and fat. They had very little color-blindness and virtually no myopia, astigmatism, glaucoma, or hypertensive and coronary heart disease. Malaria, trachoma, and intestinal parasitism reflected differences in habitat and ways of life, but tuberculosis did not. Despite a density as high as that recorded for any human population, the Lau, living on small artificial islets in a saltwater lagoon, enjoyed robust health.'

'Focus of attention on the geophysical interpretation of the topographic features of the sea floor calls for an appraisal of the nomenclature problem. Valuable contributions have already been made by various committees, national and international, but certain important problems remain. Since historical priority and customary usage rank high in the normal nomenclatorial systems of science, a careful review of existing methods and names is submitted, together with recommendations. Analysis and proposals for the extremely complex area of the South-West Pacific (Melanesia to Eastern Australia) will be reserved for a subsequent article.'

'Modernity is often assumed to correlate with increased secularism, though scholarly literature challenges this idea, linking ideas about modern subjectivity to Protestant Reformation philosophies. Tracing the impact of Reformation ideologies across time and space is crucial to understanding modernity, especially in situations where some of the first \xe2\x80\x9cmodern\xe2\x80\x9d colonial settlers were Protestant missionaries. A key concept for understanding modernity is \xe2\x80\x9cpurification,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to attempts to solidify categorical boundaries, usually around culturally defined dualisms. Archaeological remains from mission sites and other colonial institutions around the Pacific reveal problems that emerge where cultural contacts produce hybrid phenomena, despite projects of reform aimed at purification.'

"Island Southeast Asia extends across both the equatorial and the intermediate tropical zones of world climate, and it also spans a region of complex and geologically unstable land and sea relationships. The Sundaland region in the west and the isolated islands of Wallacea in the east both witnessed complex trajectories of human movement and evolution during the Pleistocene. The record of human evolution in Sundaland is still affected by uncertainties over phylogeny, dates, and archaeological correlations. Initial human settlement across Huxley's Line into Wallacea cannot at present be proven to be older than the Late Pleistocene. Stone tool industries dating to within the past 40,000 years are described, including new discoveries which indicate a surprising level of technological virtuosity. Human populations of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene are also considered in terms of skeletal and genetic data, particularly with respect to the rather controversial antecedents of the present, mainly Mongoloid, population. The article terminates its coverage at about 2000 B.C., within the period characterized by the expansion of speakers of Austronesian languages and by the expansion of agriculture into a porous and often-resistant network of hunter-gatherer societies. The archaeological and ethnographic records of the region bear witness to a continuous but dwindling existence of hunting and gathering right through to the present day. While the results of archaeology occupy a central position in the reconstruction of Southeast Asian prehistory, a proper understanding can be achieved only if a multidisciplinary standpoint is adopted."

'There have been no surveys of the cattle population for brucellosis in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) for more than 15\xc2\xa0years. This study used disease surveillance as a capacity building training tool and to examine some of the constraints that impede surveillance in PICTs. The study also developed and implemented a series of surveys for detecting antibodies to B. abortus in cattle in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands contributing to OIE requirements. The findings indicated lack of funds, lack of technical capacity, shortage of veterinarians, high turnover of in-country officials and lack of awareness on the impacts of animal diseases on public health that were constraining active disease surveillance. During the development and implementation of the surveys, constraints highlighted were outdated census data on farm numbers and cattle population, lack of funds for mobilisation of officials to carry out the surveys, lack of equipment for collecting and processing samples, lack of staff knowledge on blood sampling, geographical difficulties and security in accessing farms. Some of the reasons why these were constraints are discussed with likely solutions presented. The detection surveys had the objectives of building capacity for the country officials and demonstrating freedom from brucellosis in cattle for PNG, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. PNG, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands all demonstrated freedom from bovine brucellosis in the areas surveyed using the indirect ELISA test. Fiji had an outbreak of brucellosis, and the objective was to determine its distribution and prevalence on untested farms. The Muaniweni district surveyed during the training had a 95\xc2\xa0% confidence interval for true prevalence between 1.66 and 5.45\xc2\xa0%. The study showed that active disease surveillance could be used as a tool for training officials thus, improves surveillance capacity in resource poor countries.'

'The 27-bp deletion in the erythrocyte band 3 gene (B3\xce\x9427) constitutes a genetic basis for Southeast Asian and Melanesian ovalocytosis. The distribution of B3\xce\x9427 has been interpreted to reflect malaria selection or dispersal of the recent expansion of Austronesian-speaking populations. To explore these two hypotheses, we examined eight malarious populations of the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) that speak both the Austronesian and Papuan languages. The B3\xce\x9427 allele frequencies within populations were not positively correlated with malaria endemicities. In contrast, statistically significant geographical variations in the B3\xce\x9427 allele distribution were observed. B3\xce\x9427 was high (0.06\xe2\x80\x930.07) in the islands, intermediate (0.02\xe2\x80\x930.03) in coastal regions, but was absent or rare (0.00\xe2\x80\x930.01) in inland populations. Furthermore, the prevalence of the mitochondrial DNA region V 9-bp deletion, associated with the Austronesian expansion, was significantly correlated with that of B3\xce\x9427. These results suggest that B3\xce\x9427 was introduced by Austronesian-speaking people within the past 3,500 years and susequently expanded to populations along the coasts and islands of PNG. This study highlights the contribution of population origins, patterns of gene flow, disease selection and genetic drift in determining the genetic compositions of present populations.'

'Petrological and geochemical data on dredged samples from five submarine volcanos northwest of Samoa indicate that three of these volcanos belong to the Samoan volcanic province (Field, Lalla Rookh, and Combe banks), and two belong to separate magmatic zones (Wallis Islands and Alexa Bank). The Samoan volcanic province increases in age westward and both shield-building tholeiitic and alkalic lavas (Combe Bank) and strongly undersaturated (post-erosional?) melilitites or nephelinites and ankaramites (Field and Lalla Rookh banks) are present. The age progression and petrochemical character of these rocks is consistent with a fixed hotspot beneath eastern Samoa. Slightly askew from this trend is Alexa Bank where dredged lavas are ocean-island tholeiites; however, its radiometric age and compositional characteristics apparently preclude its association with Samoa by a fixed-hotspot model. Dredged volcanic rocks from near the Wallis Islands are geochemically, petrologically, and temporally different from Samoan volcanism, but are similar in these respects to Quaternary volcanism in Rotuma and Fiji and may be related to plate reorganization accompanying opening of the North Fiji Basin.'

'Ideas about \xe2\x80\x98culture\xe2\x80\x99 have often been used to explain, or excuse, acts of corruption. Gift giving, it is sometimes said, is \xe2\x80\x98part of our culture\xe2\x80\x99. Outsiders should not confuse it with bribery or corruption. Such a relativistic approach has been strongly criticized by academic writers on corruption, such as Sayed Alatas in his classic Sociology of Corruption, and by activists, such as Transparency International.'

'Most Pacific Island countries are located in the tropics, where there is an abundance of mosquitoes with the potential to carry debilitating or life-threatening vector-borne diseases. This article examines three Melanesian countries in which malaria is endemic\xe2\x80\x94Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu\xe2\x80\x94but the threat posed by the spread of malaria gives the issues a broader significance to the Pacific region. After discussing the spatial distribution and prevalence of malaria in the Pacific, the article examines a number of health interventions through which people have sought to control malaria. Although the disease was nearly eradicated in the Pacific in the 1970s, it is no longer in retreat. The article concludes by examining why there are still grounds for cautious optimism, and the challenges that Pacific Island countries face in reducing the impact of malaria on their populations. There is a need for prompt and concerted action on malaria at the national, regional and international levels if the public health concerns arising from the disease are to be adequately addressed.'

'To examine genetic affinity among Oceanian populations, polymorphisms of exons six and seven of the ABO blood group gene (ABO) were investigated in three populations\xe2\x80\x94Munda town, Paradise village, and Rawaki village\xe2\x80\x94in the New Georgia group of the Solomon Islands. The Munda and Paradise populations consist of Austronesian (AN)-speaking Melanesians; the Rawaki population consists of AN-speaking Micronesians who migrated from the Gilbert Islands to the New Georgia Islands approximately 30\xc2\xa0years ago. We recently described the polymorphisms of ABO in three other Oceanian populations\xe2\x80\x94Balopa Islanders (AN-speaking Melanesians), Gidra (non-AN-speaking Melanesians), and Tongans (AN-speaking Polynesians). The results from these six Oceanian populations suggest: (1) the main alleles in Oceanian populations are ABO*A101, ABO*A102, ABO*B101, ABO*O01, and ABO*O02, among which the most predominant is ABO*O01, and (2) there are marked differences in the ABO allele frequency spectrum among Oceanian populations. The different geographical distribution of ABO alleles provides insight into the migration history of AN-speaking populations in Oceania.'

'We propose the integration of six data layers (topography, isohyets, soil potential, household localization, vegetation types and land lease titles) to assess the constraints facing food production in Vanuatu, Melanesia. All layers are digitalized allowing area computations of polygons associated with the various data sets. For each island, the following are computed: total area, good arable land area, coconut plantations, pastures/grasslands, area under land lease titles and average accessible good land per household. Although Vanuatu is often considered as not densely populated (19\xc2\xa0hab/km2), results indicate great variation among islands. The average area of good land per household varies from 530\xc2\xa0ha on the island of Tegua (North) to 0.5\xc2\xa0ha on Futuna (South). Shifting cultivation does not appear to be a serious threat to the environment. The establishment of coconut plantations and permanent pastures represents the main cause of deforestation and contributes to increased pressure on land used for food production. The integration of layers of data is a powerful tool for improving environmental planning in an archipelago under growing human pressure and natural changes.'

'The magnitude 8.1 earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed 52 people when it hit the Solomon Islands on 2 April 2007. That number would have likely been considerably higher were it not for the appropriate reaction of the indigenous coastal populations and a helpful physical geography. Buffering coral reefs reflected some wave energy back to sea, reducing the power of the wave. Hills a short distance behind the coastal villages provided accessible havens. Despite this beneficial physiography, immigrant populations died at disproportionately high rates in comparably damaged areas because they did not recognize the signs of the impeding tsunami. The indigenous population of Tapurai, which lacks a steep barrier reef to reflect the incoming energy, experienced a much more powerful wave, and the population suffered heavy losses. Indigenous knowledge as an integral tool in basin wide tsunami warning systems has the potential to mitigate disasters in the near field. Community-based disaster management plans must be cognizant of educating diverse populations that have different understandings of their environment.'

'The use of an ichthyotoxic legume in the genus Denis (Fabaceae) in Guadalcanal is reported. Contrasted with other traditional methods of fishing, fish poisoning with plants is a safe activity that results in small but consistent yields. Ethnotaxonomic terms for ichthyotoxic legumes and fruits in Melanesia and Polynesia are compared and discussed.'

'The large islands and archipelagos fanning out from the Southeast corner of Asia can be seen to constitute a region wherein socio-economic, cultural and political differences provide ample bases for disputation. In seeking areas of potential common ground for cooperation this paper examines the population problems faced by the nations of the region. Analysis is based on recently released population projections from the United Nations Population Division. There are great differences among the countries, to be sure: differences in scale, in relative economic dependency burdens, and particularly in current trends in fertility and mortality. Even these can be seen as fruitful topics for collaboration, particularly if attention is focused on the state or provincial rather than national level. There are nonetheless important areas of commonality: all nations are facing the problem of raising levels of schooling in line with parents\xe2\x80\x99 aspirations and economic needs, all face problems of caring for a rising proportion of aged, and all have difficulties with the monitoring and control of international migration. Also, since minority groups in many countries are majority polities in neighbouring states, there is potential for establishing international dialogues aimed at relieving internal tensions. Australia, as the largest donor in the region, has a unique opportunity to take the lead in promoting constructive contacts in Austronesia to address these and other population policy issues.'

'New GLORIA imagery over the complex backarc area of the northern New Hebrides Arc clearly outlines the deeply faulted Jean Charcot Troughs. The troughs are 2400\xe2\x80\x933000 m deep and are not magmatically active. They appear to be fragmented older crust and are not backarc basins in the usual sense.'

'The islands of remote Polynesia (east of Rotuma, Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand) have long been thought to contain few, if any, native ants. The findings of recent sediment core studies, however, challenge this conventional wisdom and indicate some species may be native. The majority of ant species in remote Polynesia, however, are introductions from tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Despite this diversity of origins, and the lack of a common coevolutionary history in the region, patterns of organization in remote Polynesian ant communities are generally similar to those observed in coevolved continental areas. The distribution of ant species across Polynesia is consistent with a primary mechanism of anthropogenic introductions, with the availability of suitable habitat as a secondary mechanism. The species-area relationship for better-collected Polynesian islands reveals these islands are depauperate compared to Melanesian islands with endemic species. Four out of five of the \xe2\x80\x9cworld\xe2\x80\x99s worst\xe2\x80\x9d invasive ant species are present in remote Polynesia. Recent studies have documented how range expansions of such ant species have had detrimental effects on native arthropod populations, although the overall effects of introduced ants per se on na\xc3\xafve endemic island arthropods may never be known with certainty. Considering the relatively fragile nature of island ecosystems, and the potential transformative effects of invasive ants on arthropod communities, vigilance is required to prevent the spread of invasive ant species across Polynesia.'

'This paper continues a series of publications on tectonics, structural evolution, and formation mechanism of abyssal basins. The Pacific abyssal basins of the Western thalassogen are subdivided into three types: intermontane, interfault, and syneclise-type. The new term thalassosyneclise is proposed for the third type. Basins of the first, second, and third types are developed in the western, northeastern, and southern Pacific, respectively. The main mechanism responsible for the formation of basins belonging to the first two types is a stepwise subsidence of the oceanic bottom. The formation of a thalassosyneclise abyssal basin is probably related to energy flux of the South Pacific plume.'

"The Pacific Islands are undoubtedly vulnerable to famine. There is varied evidence of past famines in the local Pacific languages, in the ethnographic accounts of Pacific islands, and in the reports of the missionary groups. This famine vulnerability is because of the prevalence of natural disasters and the limited ability of the different island social systems to adapt to these extreme events. The famine vulnerability in the Pacific islands bears both similarities and dissimilarities to the more researched vulnerability of South Asia. Five recent examples of famines or potential famines strongly suggest that the Pacific islands remain liable to famine and that the rapid influx of foreign food relief recently does not remove the islands' inherent susceptibility to famine. By masking the terminal symptoms of famine crises, the influx of food relief may cause loss of the opportunity to develop more sustainable island food systems."

'Remote Oceania was colonized initially in three migratory phases: the western archipelagos of Micronesia plus eastern Melanesia out to west Polynesia in the period 3500\xe2\x80\x932800\xc2\xa0cal BP (all dates hereafter are cal BP), central and eastern Micronesia 2200\xe2\x80\x932000 BP and east and south Polynesia 1100\xe2\x80\x93700 BP. The early and late migration phases are best-known archaeologically. During these phases a number of plants and animals were introduced. Of the latter, the pig (Sus scrofa), dog (Canis familiaris), fowl or chicken (Gallus gallus) and rats (Rattus spp., especially R. exulans) were most deliberately associated with human settlement. The pattern of introductions appears to be only partly in agreement with an implication of widespread early distribution derived from the orthodox colonisation model of \xe2\x80\x98transported landscape\xe2\x80\x99 coupled with sophisticated seafaring. Within the two main migrations the pattern of introductions is similar. Excepting in the movement to West Micronesia, all four taxa were transported into the islands nearest their proximate sources at, or soon after, the beginning of migration, but their introduction to more remote islands was partial and patchy. Evaluation of invasibility, invasiveness and transportability characteristics amongst the four taxa suggest that island size and complexity, propagule pressure and seafaring capability were important factors in differential distribution and survival. Seafaring capability was especially important because it determined the extent of accessibility to islands near and far and the degree of propagule or introduction pressure that was exerted. Framing the archaeological data within a model of invasion biology offers a richer and more systematic approach to the complexities of introduction than adopting a culture-historical perspective.'

' DNA variation on the non-recombining portion of the Y\xc2\xa0chromosome was examined in 610 male samples from 14 global populations in north, east, and southeast Asia, and other regions of the world. Eight haplotypes were observed by analyses of seven biallelic polymorphic markers (DYS257 108, DYS287, SRY 4064, SRY 10831, RPS4Y 711, M9, and M15) and were unevenly distributed among the populations. Maximum parsimony tree for the eight haplotypes showed that these haplotypes could be classified into four distinct lineages characterized by three key mutations: an insertion of the Y\xc2\xa0Alu polymorphic (YAP) element at DYS287, a C-to-G transversion at M9, and a C-to-T transition at RPS4Y 711. Of the four lineages, three major lineages (defined by the allele of YAP+, M9-G, and RPS4Y-T, respectively) accounted for 98.6% of the Asian populations studied, indicating that these three paternal lineages have contributed to the formation of modern Asian populations. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed three monophyletic Asian clusters, which consisted of north Asian, Japanese, and Han Chinese/southeast Asian populations, respectively. Coalescence analysis in the haplotype tree showed that the estimated ages for three key mutations ranged from 53,000 to 95,000\xc2\xa0years, suggesting that the three lineages were separated from one another during early stages of human evolutionary history. The distribution patterns of the Y-haplotypes and mutational ages for the key markers suggest that three major groups with different paternal ancestries separately migrated to prehistoric east and southeast Asia.'

'Quaternary sediments in the Woodlark Basin and New Georgia Sound, adjacent to the Solomon Islands volcanic arc, are hemipelagic. They consist of mixtures of clay minerals, calcareous plankton (foraminifera, coccoliths, and pteropods), and sand- and silt-sized volcanic debris. Variations in sediment composition are related primarily to distance from land (the source of volcanic components), water depth (because of the Aragonite and Calcite Compensation Depths), and bathymetric isolation. Much of the sedimentary debris is delivered to the basin by turbidity currents and other mass movements; little material is supplied by ash fall. Sedimentation rates appear to exceed 3 cm/1,000 years in New Georgia Sound, and range from 2 to 4.5 cm/1,000 years in the Woodlark Basin.'

'The craniometrical comparison of the skulls with the heads of modern Pukapukan males revealed a feature, that the prehistoric specimens were mesocranic, whereas the modern people showed brachycephalic.'

'The Woodlark triple junction region, a topographically and structurally complex triangular area of Quaternary age, lies east of Simbo Ridge and southwest of the New Georgia island group, Solomon Islands, at the junction of the Pacific, Australian and Solomon Sea plates. SeaMARC II side-scan imagery and bathymetry in conjunction with seismic reflection profiles, 3.5 kHz records, and petrologic, magnetic and gravity data show that the active Woodlark spreading centre does not extend into this region.'

'\nWhile islands have been identified in numerous discourses as being highly vulnerable, food security was a cornerstone of many traditional Pacific Island societies from inland and coastal communities in large islands with considerable natural assets to those that occupied extremely small, low-lying atolls with little or no soil and limited water resources. This was sustained through agro-ecological biodiversity, the production of surpluses which enabled food preservation and storage to be practiced and underpinned networks of exchange and mutual support that were particularly important during times of hardship such as disruptive extreme natural events, the use of resilient crops and using \xe2\x80\x98famine\xe2\x80\x99 foods. Colonisation, the introduction of new religions, the spread of capitalism, most recently in the context of globalisation, has seen many of these practices decline (some have disappeared altogether) as crop diversity has been reduced (making way for export products such as copra), food storage and preservation are now rarely practised, resilient crops have been replaced, famine foods have lost their importance in the face of disaster relief, and many traditional networks have declined. Food imports have become critical, not only in the growing urban areas, but also in rural communities. The paper concludes by addressing key challenges facing Pacific Island countries in order to revitalise those traditional elements of food security in ways that are likely to find acceptance in contemporary society and enable them to adapt to the effects of climate change.'

'Although aquatic resources are often seen as central to the development of post-Pleistocene cultural complexity, most models of human evolution have all but ignored the role of aquatic or maritime adaptations during the earlier stages of human history. When did aquatic resources, maritime adaptations, and seafaring first play a significant role in human evolution? I explore this fundamental question by (1) reviewing various theories on the subject; (2) discussing a variety of problems that prevent archaeologists from providing a clear answer; and (3) examining the archaeological record for evidence of early aquatic resource use or seafaring. I conclude that aquatic resources, wherever they were both abundant and relatively accessible, have probably always been used opportunistically by our ancestors. Evidence suggests, however, that aquatic and maritime adaptations (including seafaring) played a significantly greater role in the demographic and geographic expansion of anatomically modern humans after about 150,000 years ago. Another significant expansion occurred somewhat later in time, with the development of more sophisticated seafaring, fishing, and marine hunting technologies.'

'The south Pacific region contains a large genetic resource for the genetic improvement of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L.). A study of the diversity in the species was made during 1992/3 using fruit component analysis on a representative sample from 29 distinct south Pacific populations in order to characterise the germplasm present in the region. A large diversity in fruit morphology was found that ranged from populations exhibiting wild-type characters in central Pacific to populations displaying domesticated characteristics in Rennell Island, the Sikaiana Islands, the Marquesas Islands, and in Papua New Guinea. Many populations exhibited fruit characteristics intermediate between the two, which were thought to have arisen due to introgressive hybridisation between the wild and domesticated populations. Continuous variation in fruit morphology was found in these populations, and cluster analysis arbitrarily divided the continuum into discrete groups which were consistent with geographic affinities. Groups were defined in Melanesia, Western Polynesia and Eastern Polynesia. The continuum displayed clinal variation from populations with small fruit and low husk content in the west to large fruit and more husk in the east of the region. The wild and domesticated populations were found in disjunct pockets throughout the area, and did not form part of the clines. Most populations consisted of a wide range of fruit morphology, from individuals expressing wild-type characters to those with domestic-type characters. The occurrence of both wild and domesticated populations within the clinal variation indicates that further exploration should be made to determine the presence of other potentially useful populations. While this activity is proceeding, collection and conservation can proceed using the classification already defined.'

'In Solomon Islands, forests have provided people with ecological services while being affected by human use and protection. This study used a quantitative ethnobotanical analysis to explore the society\xe2\x80\x93forest interaction and its transformation in Roviana, Solomon Islands. We compared local plant and land uses between a rural village and urbanized village. Special attention was paid to how local people depend on biodiversity and how traditional human modifications of forest contribute to biodiversity conservation.'

'The origins of agriculture have been debated by archaeologists for most of the discipline\xe2\x80\x99s history, no more so than in Island Southeast Asia. The orthodox view is that Neolithic farmers spread south by sea from mainland China to Taiwan and thence to Island Southeast Asia, taking with them a new material culture and domestic rice and pigs and speaking the precursor of the Austronesian languages that are spoken in the region today. Opponents of this \xe2\x80\x98farming/language dispersal\xe2\x80\x99 theory have proposed models of acculturation, in which foragers acquired new material culture and food resources by trading with farmers. However, new work in archaeology, palaeoecology, palynology and anthropology, especially in Borneo, and in genetics and linguistics for the region as a whole, is suggesting that foraging/farming transitions in Southeast Asia were far more complex than either of these opposing \xe2\x80\x98grand narratives\xe2\x80\x99 of discontinuity (population colonisation) or continuity (acculturation) allows. Through the course of the Early/Mid-Holocene new material culture, technologies and foods were variously taken up, promoted or resisted in order to provision changes in the social and ideological constitution of societies. Whilst new readings of the data for foraging\xe2\x80\x93farming transitions in the region vary, a consensus is emerging that it is more useful to focus on how materials and modes of life were used to underwrite changes in social networks than to seek to explain the archaeological record in terms of migrating farmers or acculturating foragers.'

'Technological advances are making genetic data collection and analysis feasible on a scale unimaginable only a few years ago. Early genetic research using mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome provided important insights for macroscale modeling of regional and continent-wide population movements, but the capacity to study the entire genome now opens an era of finer-grained, mesoscale studies of regional and local population histories that are more compatible with the scale of archaeological analysis. The utility of integrating both types of data is illustrated by a case study from Oceania, where genetic studies were used to evaluate two models for the geographic origins of the populations that colonized Polynesia beginning ca. 3000 bp, bringing with them the distinctive Lapita cultural assemblage. A second case study considers the application of genetic studies to an understanding of Fulbe history, especially that of the pastoral Fulbe. Both archaeological and genetic data are underdeveloped for the key Fulbe homeland regions of Mauritania and Senegal, but recent research in the Middle Senegal Valley permits some conjectures on the history of Fulbe nomadic pastoralism. The article concludes with suggestions for a multidisciplinary research agenda to expand and upgrade the quality of relevant archaeological data, incorporate biodistance studies of human skeletal material, and improve and expand genetic sampling using more historically sensitive collection protocols.'

"Since early 1991, the EM12 dual multibeam echo sounder mounted on R/V L'Atalante has been mainly used for regional mapping and more particularly for EEZ exploration. The acoustic imagery data, which is collected at the same time as the multibeam soundings, and positioned with the same accuracy, illustrates the variability of the acoustic interface."

'Prior to the European colonial expansions of the past several centuries the Austronesian (AN) language family had the greatest geographical extent of any on earth, including in its territory areas that had never previously been settled. Although predominantly distributed in a tropical or subtropical environment, AN-speaking peoples exhibit a wide range of physical types, material cultures, and types of social and political organization. This paper addresses ways in which linguistic comparison can contribute toward answering such questions as the following: Where was the AN homeland? What was the nature of early AN material culture, social and political organization? What can we infer about early AN pathology? How did early AN speakers view the spirit world? It concludes with a discussion of culture loss, many examples of which can be inferred both from the Pacific and from insular Southeast Asia.'

'The question of the introduction of domesticated plants from the Sunda plate (South-east Asia) to Sahul (New Guinea, Australia and Tasmania) has been a subject of speculation and debate for decades. This paper reviews recent phylogenetic studies conducted with biomolecular markers on bananas (Musa spp.), breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta) and the greater yam (Dioscorea alata). Biomolecular evidence for plant domestication in Sahul is presented and discussed. Biomolecular markers reveal that for these crops at least, domestication has occurred in New Guinea and further east in Melanesia. This domestication produced cultivated genotypes that were selected from the endemic wild gene pools. These areas of domestication still are important centres of diversity for crop species that also exist in Asia. For most crops, genetic distances are very important between the two gene pools due to the geographic isolation of the two continental plates. The implications of these findings have obvious bearings on genetic resources programme strategies and future surveys.'

'Subsistence agriculture in the Pacific Islands has a complex prehistory centered on western Melanesia. Based on an analysis of cultigen provenience, a sequential model of a three-tiered crop structure of indigenous agricultural systems has been derived: (1) The independent early domestication of endemic species in the New Guinea region; (2) introduction of species from Southeast Asia; (3) the advent of American crop plants. The temporal sequence has archaeological and linguistic confirmation of 10 000 years ago for the beginnings of agriculture, 6000 years for Southeast Asian introduction, with the sweet potato contributing in Polynesia in prehistory, and in Melanesia only in post-Columbian times. Recent research directed toward issues of domestication in New Guinea and subsistence prehistory in Australia on three genera,Canarium, Colocasia andIpomoea, exemplify under-recognized resources with quite different potentials for economic botany. Unlike past exploitation of indigenous plant resources, future users of plants such as those exemplified, and especially where commercialization is involved, cannot avoid addressing intellectual property rights that pertain to species domesticated, selected or conserved by peoples of the non-industri-alized world.'

' P-waves recorded on Ponape Island at the northern end of the Ontong Java plateau have been investigated. Different modes of propagation in the distance range 12\xc2\xb0 to 17\xc2\xb0 \xce\x94 between paths from Melanesian earthquakes across the Ontong Java plateau and paths from Mariana earthquakes across the eastern Mariana basin suggest that the mantle underlying the regions is not homogeneous. Travel-times of P-waves beneath the Ontong Java plateau are slower than for paths beneath the east Mariana basin. The frequency content of the first-arriving P-waves is lower for paths across the Ontong Java plateau than for the east Mariana basin. The disparate crustal thicknesses of the Ontong Java plateau and east Mariana basin may influence the relative amplitude of oceanic Pn, with smaller amplitudes corresponding to a thicker crust. Pn-P differential times for the Ontong Java plateau show a general decrease with the depth of earthquake focus but no comparable trend is seen in the Mariana data, possibly because of the scatter. The observation of high-frequency oceanic Pn propagation across the Ontong Java Plateau is suggestive that the plateau is not of continental origin.'

'Over millennia of breadfruit cultivation, hundreds of named cultivars have been developed that display a high degree of morphological diversity. The current study was undertaken to evaluate morphological diversity within the National Tropical Botanical Garden\xe2\x80\x99s breadfruit germplasm collection, the largest and most diverse breadfruit collection in the world. A set of 57 standardized morphological descriptors including 29 leaf, 22 fruit, four seed, and two male inflorescence characteristics were used to describe and contrast 221 accessions of breadfruit including accessions of Artocarpus camansi Blanco, A. altilis (Parkinson) Fosberg, A. mariannensis Tr\xc3\xa9cul, early generation A. altilis\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0A. mariannensis hybrids, and domesticated A. altilis\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa0A. mariannensis hybrids. A morphological transition from heavily seeded fruit covered with flexible spines to fewer seeded, smoother skinned fruit of similar size was observed in the domestication of A. altilis from A. camansi. Further selection of true seedless, smooth-skinned cultivars of A. altilis appears to have occurred with human migrations from Melanesia into Polynesia. Cultivars from Micronesia exhibit morphological characteristics indicative of hybridization with the endemic species A. mariannensis. These data were used to generate a multi-access cultivar identification key on the Lucid platform that can be used to identify trees of known cultivars or to predict nearest cultivar relationships for previously undescribed cultivars. Overall, this study provides new insights into the morphological changes that occurred during domestication, helps visualize the diversity that exists across geographical regions, and provides a framework for cultivar identification and germplasm conservation.'

'The distinctive features of island endemism in Lasiocampidae are extensive adaptive radiation and vicariance. These phenomena are especially typical of archipelagoes, where different taxa occur on closely located islands. The diverse ecological conditions of the islands determine the presence of a great number of subordinate taxa. Owing to the reduced flight activity, the species of Lasiocampidae are characterized by a high level of endemism on isolated islands. Islands of continental origin (Sumatra, Borneo) have a lower level of endemism, with centers on the mountain ranges. The endemism level is much higher in islands of biogenic origin (the Philippines). The Pacific islands have a higher index of specific endemism. At the same time, the islands of mixed and oceanic origin have low species diversity by a large fraction of endemic taxa. The boundaries of species distribution are determined not only by the landscape or climatic factors but also by biological ones.'

'Two species,Canarium salomonense B. L. Burtt andC. indicum L. were formerly used by Solomon Islands cultures as principal sources of food (seeds), resin, and wood as well as a variety of ceremonial activities. Although the species are botanically quite similar, Babatana and Ririo speakers from Lauru (Choiseul) Island considerC. salomonense superior for many uses, particularly in activities of special spiritual significance. Ethnographic interviews were used to quantitatively evaluate hypotheses about community perceptions of differences between the species. Weighted and unweighted evaluations were made within emic activity categories based upon frequency of interaction withCanarium and importance of species selectivity within the interaction activity. No significant difference was found between the species based upon unweighted frequency of use within activity categories. However, C. salomonese is significantly more important for use in activities when its relative cultural importance was used to weight the comparison. This example supports a broad conclusion that importance of a species to a culture is more complex than its simple usefulness.'

'In the articulation-of-modes-of-production literature there is a tendency to treat conceptual structures as if they had lives of their own. Thus modes of production are sometimes portrayed as meeting, intertwining, and reproducing like giant organisms animated by ineluctable laws of motion. But these structures and categories are primarily the products of thought. As such, they cannotdo anything, and they possess no motivational capacity whatsoever. They are simply analytical tools, more-or-less useful in explaining how and why history unfolded in the way it did.'

'It is possible that climatic change may stimulate population movements as people turn to migration as one strategy of adaptation. This paper attempts to assess possible migration flows which may occur, in response to climatic shifts over the next thirty years, from small island states in the south-west Pacific ocean region to the United States, Australia and New Zealand. It is argued that the small island states appear vulnerable to climatic change, with low coral atolls being most at risk. Adverse impacts of climatic change will be one extra pressure on small island states, many of which are already struggling to cope with sustainable management of their natural resources and with the demands of their rapidly growing populations for education, housing and employment. The migration strategy is likely to entail significant medium-term health, psychological and social costs for some Pacific island migrants as they try to move or cope with life in western industrialised societies.'

'Climate change poses severe threats to developing countries. Scientists predict entire states (e.g. Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Maldives) will become inhabitable. People living in these states have to resettle to other countries. Media and politicians warn that climate change will trigger migration flows in dimensions unknown to date. It is feared that millions from developing countries overwhelm developed societies and increase pressures on anyway ailing social support systems destabilizing societies and becoming a potential source of conflict.'

'Little information is available on resistance to anti-malarial drugs in the Solomon Islands (SI). The analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug resistance associated parasite genes is a potential alternative to classical time- and resource-consuming in vivo studies to monitor drug resistance. Mutations in pfmdr1 and pfcrt were shown to indicate chloroquine (CQ) resistance, mutations in pfdhfr and pfdhps indicate sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance, and mutations in pfATPase6 indicate resistance to artemisinin derivatives.'

'The archaeology of colonialism can destabilize orthodox historical narratives because of its critical engagement with multiple lines of evidence, revealing ways that different perspectives can complement or contradict what was assumed to be known about the past. In Oceania, archaeology that blends evidence from landscapes, sites, and artifacts with written documents as well as oral traditions reveals the role of indigenous people in shaping colonial encounters across the region over the last five centuries. The challenge lies with how to interpret this material in terms of ongoing struggles over land, resources, and identity in the region today, encapsulated by the tension between global and local.'

'Various processes (selection, mutation, migration and genetic dirft) are known to determine the frequency of genetic disease in human populations, but so far it has proved almost impossible to decide to what extent each is responsible for the presence of a particular genetic disease. The techniques of gene and haplotype analysis offer new hope in addressing this issue, and we review relevant studies of three haemoglobinopathies: sickle cell anaemia, and \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 thalassaemia. We show how for each disease it is possible to recognize a pattern of regionally specific mutations, found in association with one or a few haplotypes, that is best explained as the result of selection; other patterns are due to population migration and genetic drift. However, we caution that such conclusions can be drawn in special circumstances only. In the case of the haemoglobinopathies it is possible because a selective agent (malaria) was already suspected, and the investigations could be carried out in relatively genetically homogenous populations whose migratory histories are known. Moreover, some data reviewed here suggest that gene conversion and the haplotype composition of a population may affect the frequency of a mutation, making interpretation of gene frequencies difficult on the basis of standard population genetics theory. Hence attempts to use the same approaches with other genetic diseases are likely to be frustrated by a lack of suitably untrammelled populations and by difficulties accounting for poorly understood genetic processes. We conclude that although this combination of molecular and population genetics is successful when applied to the study of haemoglobinopathies, it may not be so easy to apply it to the study of other genetic diseases.'

'Auditory exostoses have been included in craniological investigations since the last century and recently comprised among epigenetic traits. There is general agreement on the importance of environmental and behavioural factors on the expression of these bony formations, in particular habitual diving and swimming in cold water.'

'Tectonic typification of the abyssal basins of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans is proposed. Six types of basins are recognized: perispreading, pericontinental, central thalassogenic, intermontane abyssal, interfault, and thalassosyneclise. The tectonic diversity of the basins and their systems reflects significant regional tectono-geodynamic features of the oceanic lithosphere. Basins of the first type are inherent to the Atlantic Ocean; of the second and third types, to the Indian Ocean; and of the fourth to sixth types, to the Pacific. In the Atlantic Ocean, the basins are spatially and paragenetically conjugated with the mid-oceanic ridge. Beyond the Atlantic, a similar situation is characteristic of the southern Indian Ocean only. Hence, differentiated energetic models of deep geospheres are required. The relations of potentially economic fields of ferromanganese nodules to tectonic types of abyssal basins are discussed. The largest fields with respect to both dimensions and reserves are confined to interfault and intermontane abyssal basins. The fields localized in central thalassogenic basins are second in importance. The perispreading and pericontinental basins are the least promising in this respect. Along with other criteria, tectonic analysis should be taken into consideration in the future development of these valuable mineral resources.'

'The colonization of Oceania occurred in two waves. By 32,000 BP, humans had reached New Guinea and settled all intervisible islands east to the Solomon Islands. Around 3,500 BP, a distinct intrusive group from Southeast Asia reached coastal New Guinea, integrated their components with indigenous resources, and gave rise to the Lapita Cultural Complex. Within 2,500\xc2\xa0years, Lapita and its descendant cultures colonized the Pacific. To uncover the origin of the Lapita Cultural Complex, we analyzed the hypervariable region I of the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) in 219 individuals from eight East Sepik Province villages: two villages in each of four environmental zones. Same-zone villages spoke different languages: one Austronesian and three Papuan (Arapesh, Abelam, and Boiken). Our analysis examined whether language or geography better predicted gene flow. In general, language better predicted genetic affinities. Boiken villages across all four zones showed no significant genetic difference (FST  P value\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05). In contrast, the Austronesian village was significantly different to most other villages (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). Only the mountains and coast showed zonal gene flow (P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05). We interpret the data to reflect limited gene flow inland by Austronesians overshadowed by a regional displacement by inland Boiken speakers migrating seaward. These results are consistent with oral histories and ethnographic accounts.'

'In the oceans of the tropical and warm-temperate zone (40\xc2\xb0 N\xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xb0 S), only a small number of islands are high enough to show timberline and alpine vegetation. Excluding large islands with a more continental climate, only the following oceanic islands are relevant: Pico (Azores), Madeira, Tenerife, Gran Canaria and La Palma (Canary islands), Fogo (Cape Verde islands), Fernando Poo (Bioko) and Tristan da Cunha in the Atlantic Ocean, R\xc3\xa9union and Grande Comore (Ngazidja) in the Indian Ocean, Yakushima (Japan), Maui and Hawaii (Hawaiian islands), and Mas Afuera (Juan Fernandez islands) in the Pacific Ocean. Timberline and alpine vegetation exist here under a unique combination of a highly oceanic climate and a marked geographic isolation which contrasts with the tropical alpine vegetation in the extended mountains of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.'

'The distributions and affinities of the macrolepidopteran taxa known from south-eastern Polynesia are investigated and contrasted with various geological hypotheses for the origin of the islands. A colonialist interpretation, long distance dispersal into a westering assemblage of small much as seen today, appears to be most probable.'

'Available geochemical and field data suggest that three different periods of igneous activity have occurred on Viti Levu. Rocks of the first period are \xe2\x80\x9cisland arc tholeiites\xe2\x80\x9d; of the second, a calc-alkaline series; and of the third, shoshonites. Each period has a geochemical distinctiveness. The temporal sequence also corresponds to a spatial zonation analogous to that observed in many currently active island arcs. K2O and the larger trace elements increase south to north and with time, whereas iron enrichment and Na2O/K2O ratios decrease. Initial Sr 87/86 ratios average about 0.7041 in rocks of all periods. If Viti Levu magmas were genetically related to underthrust oceanic crust, as is argued for comparable ones of modern island arcs, then the island must have drifted or been rotated to its present position within the last 5\xe2\x80\x9310 m.y.'

'Isolation and partial sequencing of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) variants from inhabitants of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands has confirmed the existence of virus infection in Melanesian populations. To determine the geographical distribution of seropositivity to HTLV-I in PNG we have tested 2907 serum and plasma samples collected between 1972 to 1991 from 16 different population groups. Samples were screened using a particle agglutination assay and confirmed by p21e-enhanced Western immunoblot (WB). From a total of 94 screen positive samples run on WB, 56 (60%) were confirmed positive (positive for bothenv andgag products) and 38 (40%) were WB-indeterminate (gag products only). The prevalence of WB-confirmed antibodies to HTLV-I in lowland and island populations ranged from 0 to 5.4%. There were no confirmed antibody positives in the highland populations surveyed. Geographically isolated populations living on the fringes of the highlands ranged in seropositivity from 0.2 to 5.8%. Two of the subjects surveyed gave WB antibody patterns characteristic of HTLV-II rather than HTLV-I infection.'

'Based on the summarized geological and petrogeochemical information on the basaltic magmatism on the Pacific Ocean floor, the formation-geochemical rock types, their associations in the oceanic morpho-structures, and petrological provinces were distinguished. The features of the composition variations of the rocks presented mainly by magno-and ferrotholeiites in mid-oceanic ridges and by their petrological analogues at the plates (Fenner trend) were examined. The increase in the silica acidity and alkalinity of the rocks (Bowen trend) is moderately manifested in the eastern provinces of the ocean and is much more pronounced in the western areas (including the formation of complexes constituted by significant volumes of alkaline rocks).'

'A vast radiation of hydrobiid spring snails endemic to New Caledonia, a continental island in the Southwest Pacific known for its unique flora and fauna, is described. This radiation comprises a total of 54 named species of which 50 are new. The majority of the species belong to the most basal genus, Hemistomia, which happens to be the first one described from New Caledonia. The remaining species are attributed to four genera, Kanakyella, Pidaconomus, Caledoconcha, and Leiorhagium, which are all introduced in this paper.'

'A semi-systematic literature review of national policies was carried out in relation to surveillance and disease reporting in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). It also analysed the animal disease reporting structures in Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of those reporting structures were examined in relation to how they impacted the detection and management of animal diseases in PICTs. Field missions collected information on animal disease reporting structures and these were discussed in detail with country officials and documented. The findings from the literature review indicated that there is very little policy to support work in surveillance and disease reporting within national government structures of the countries studied. This increases the potential for disease transmission and the introduction of exotic diseases as the efficiency of disease reporting is low. The findings from the SWOT analysis of the reporting structures indicated that there were commonalities across the countries studied, i.e. reporting structures were long with multiple legs that were not functioning properly and this was worsened when positions were vacant in the reporting structure. The hierarchical nature of the reporting structure also reduced reporting efficiency as reports took a longer time to reach decision makers at the top of the structure. High officer turnover and the shortage of veterinarians in the countries studied also affected the efficiency of disease reporting as most in-county officials were inexperienced and could not recognise disease signs and there were no veterinarians to supervise them. Existing reporting structures need to be reviewed to remove duplication and shorten the chain. However, this could override existing command structures and would need to be documented and awareness created with the officers involved. There also needs to be more collaboration with FAO, OIE, academic institutions and national governments to create an environment conducive for the development of policies that support work on surveillance to improve disease reporting in PICTs. The shortage of veterinarians could be addressed by influencing national governments to create better policies to retain veterinarians in the animal health services; this should be supported by creating reasonable work conditions and remuneration packages. This should also be supported with policies to send young graduates to study veterinary science overseas and have a career path for them when they return. Engagement of retired veterinarians from developed countries and re-evaluating the criteria for veterinarian registration could be short-term solutions to address the shortage of veterinarians in PICTs.'

'Adolescent obesity is prevalent in Pacific region ethnic groups (European, Melanesian and Polynesian) living in both urban and rural areas. Although body perception is an important factor of weight gain or loss, little is known about the body self-perceptions of Pacific region adolescents. This study therefore evaluated adolescent perceptions of body weight according to ethnicity (European, Melanesian or Polynesian), socioeconomic status (low, intermediate or high) and living area (rural or urban) in New Caledonia.'

'Western New Guinea constitutes a frontier zone physically, politically, culturally and conceptually between Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Despite this pivotal position, archaeological information for the region is scarce due to limited investigations, limited publication and the multilingual nature of publications. Consequently, little archaeological information about western New Guinea has percolated into the mainstream literature. This paper aims to fill this gap and provides a detailed review of archaeological research, including rock art, published in Dutch, English, French, German and Indonesian. The resultant findings are discussed in terms of continuities and discontinuities with Papua New Guinea and Island Southeast Asia.'

'\xe2\x80\x94We present relocations of over 220 historical and recent earthquakes in the northwestern part of Irian Jaya, in the context of the large earthquakes of 1979 and 1996. Our results document continuous activity on a 420-km segment of the Sorong Fault, with a possible extension over an additional 330 km to the west. We also show that some level of activity did take place on the New Guinea Trench prior to the 1996 Biak earthquake, and relocate a large (M  PAS  = 7.4) event on 02 April 1947 to the trench, at 138\xc2\xb0E. We speculate that the large earthquake of 26 May 1914 may also have taken place on the New Guinea Trench. We study the pattern of activity following the 1979 Yapen earthquake, which triggered stress release in the Pandaidori Islands, also the location of stress transfer following the 1996 Biak earthquake.'

'In March 2008, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu governments raised the goal of their National Malaria Programmes from control to elimination. Vector control measures, such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (LLINs) are key integral components of this programme. Compliance with these interventions is dependent on their acceptability and on the socio-cultural context of the local population. These factors need to be investigated locally prior to programme implementation.'

'Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods and philosophies were trialed in a volcanic risk management planning and awareness activity for Savo Island, a historically highly destructive volcano in the Solomon Islands. Through a combination of methods we tried to combine the roles of facilitators and educators, and to involve the input of all stakeholders (from community to national government) in the process of volcanic risk management. The PRA approach was an ideal way to address the fundamental differences in outlook, education, needs, and roles of individuals and groups involved or affected. It was also an important catalyst to Savo island- or community-based planning initiatives, which are arguably the most important step toward the preparedness of the 2500 inhabitants of the island for any future destructive volcanic activity. We adapted almost every tenet of the PRA philosophy through inexperience, self-perceived importance and desire to combine both scientific and traditional views for Savo volcanic risk management planning. Nevertheless, what emerged from our experiences was an idea of how fundamentally well suited many PRA approaches are to initiating dialogue within diverse stakeholder groups, and deriving combined scientific/geologic and local/community risk assessments and mitigation action plans. The main challenge remaining includes increasing the involvement or voice of less powerful community members (women, youth, non-landowners) in risk management decision-making in such male-dominated hierarchical societies.'

'This paper explores the risks that climate change poses to food security in the islands of the South Pacific. It shows that climate change will adversely affect food systems in the region, including the supply of food from agriculture and fisheries, the ability of countries to import food, systems for the distribution of food, and the ability of households to purchase and utilize food. In these ways, climate change puts at risk the very basic and universal need for people in the islands to have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times. It is argued that for people in the South Pacific, the risks climate change poses to food security constitutes a \xe2\x80\x98dangerous\xe2\x80\x99 change in climate.'

' Savo Island is the 6-km-diameter emergent summit of an andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano, rising from the Iron Bottom Sound, 35\xc2\xa0km NW of Honiara, Solomon Islands. Savo has erupted at least three times within recorded history and the 3,000 inhabitants maintain extensive oral traditions of past events. Through description and interpretation of the volcaniclastic sequences on the island, in conjunction with historical accounts and oral traditions, we reconstruct the eruptive processes on Savo. Block-and-ash flow (BAF) deposits are volumetrically dominant on the island within three main depositional environments: near-vent sequences, thick medial channel sequences and distal fan sequences. The deposits comprise universally non-vesicular and highly porphyritic (40\xe2\x80\x9370% phenocrysts), high-silica andesite and dacite clasts. These appear to have been derived from collapsing lava domes during an 1560\xe2\x80\x931570\xc2\xa0A.D. eruption. However, eyewitness descriptions and crater morphology suggest that similar deposits formed from dome explosions or collapses of eruption columns during later eruptions (1830\xe2\x80\x931840\xc2\xa0A.D.). The high-sodium magmas (ca. 5\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xa0wt% Na2O) apparently crystallised and strongly degassed prior to eruption. Shallow explosions were possibly caused by entrapment of magmatic gases beneath a dome or conduit plug of highly crystalline, near solid magma. Repeated sealing of the vent may have been due to inward collapse of the highly altered rocks of the surrounding hydrothermal system; these rocks probably were saturated due to contemporaneous high intensity rainfall events. BAFs were hot enough to char vegetation and attain aligned clast TRM (thermal remnant magnetism) up to 3\xc2\xa0km from the vent, many being accompanied by ash-cloud surges. Changes with distance in the BAF deposits appear mostly dependent on flow confinement and are limited to an overall decrease in thickness and maximum clast size, and an increased definition of weak planar fabrics. In distal fan sequences, there is strong evidence for syn- and post-eruptive redeposition of primary deposits. Since the Savo population is concentrated on coastal volcaniclastic fans, we consider the greatest volcanic risk to life is from BAFs, associated ash-cloud surges and lahars. Hence, the main channels and fans are designated as the highest of three relative hazard zones on a simple map prepared to aid local education and planning initiatives on Savo.'

'A thorough understanding of the Pacific Ocean circulation is a necessity to solve global climate and environmental problems. Here we present a new picture of the circulation by integrating observational results. Lower and Upper Circumpolar Deep Waters (LCDW, UCDW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) of 12, 7, and 5 Sv (106 m3s\xe2\x88\x921) in the lower and upper deep layers and the surface/intermediate layer, respectively, are transported to the North Pacific from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The flow of LCDW separates in the Central Pacific Basin into the western (4 Sv) and eastern (8 Sv) branches, and nearly half of the latter branch is further separated to flow eastward south of the Hawaiian Ridge into the Northeast Pacific Basin (NEPB). A large portion of LCDW on this southern route (4 Sv) upwells in the southern and mid-latitude eastern regions of the NEPB. The remaining eastern branch joins nearly half of the western branch; the confluence flows northward and enters the NEPB along the Aleutian Trench. Most of the LCDW on this northern route (5 Sv) upwells to the upper deep layer in the northern (in particular northeastern) region of the NEPB and is transformed into North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW). NPDW shifts southward in the upper deep layer and is modified by mixing with UCDW around the Hawaiian Islands. The modified NPDW of 13 Sv returns to the ACC. The remaining volume in the North Pacific (11 Sv) flows out to the Indian and Arctic Oceans in the surface/intermediate layer.'

'\xe2\x80\x94Sidescan sonar observations show that mass wasting plays an important role in the geologic development of the Savaii Island edifice. Observations on the south and west flanks indicate that debris movement on the submarine slopes between rift zones is characterized by large sheets of unchannelized debris. Farther downslope these sheets have slumped into folded although still relatively coherent slump sheets. Closer to the rift zones, more chaotic slumps are found. The presence of large detached landslide blocks, without obvious upslope headwall scarps, suggests that earlier slumps are covered by subsequent veneers of debris moving downslope.\xc2\xb6In contrast, on Stearns Bank west of the island of Savaii most of the features are of constructional origin, formed during  the building of this volcanic edifice of unknown age. Two prominentsubmarine platforms are evident, the shallower one with a summit cone. Sea cliffs and subdued terraces record platforms cut by sea-level oscillations late in the history of the volcanic edifice. Fractures and fissures are present on the bank, however there is little evidence of landslides in this area. The absence of landslides may reflect differing ages of the bank and the island or the edifice could have remained submarine during its construction with few or no subaerially derived ashes and clays present to facilitate mass wasting.\xc2\xb6We conclude that mass wasting is an important influence on the evolution of the Savaii volcanic edifice. It appears that sediment and debris cover most of the slope outside the submarine rift zones. The sonar images indicate that mass wasting is a common process in the submarine environment. Unlike the giant landslides documented by GLORIA imagery around the Hawaiian Islands, the southern margin of Samoa is characterized by numerous small slumps and slides. Although we have little information at present regarding the recurrence interval for submarine landslides, their ubiquitous presence in these sidescan sonar records indicates that they are an important component of the geologic record of the Samoan Islands.\n'

'Pacific Island populations, particularly those of Polynesian descent, have a high prevalence of hyperuricaemia and gout. This is due to an inherently higher urate level among these populations with a demonstrated genetic predisposition. While an excess of urate can cause pathology, urate is also important for human health. It has been implicated as an antioxidant, has a neuroprotective role and is involved in innate immune responses. This paper provides a brief review of urate levels worldwide, with a particular focus on island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. We then present possible evolutionary explanations for the elevated serum urate levels among Pacific populations in the context of the physiological importance of urate and of the settlement history of the region. Finally, we propose that ancestry may play a significant role in hyperuricaemia in these populations and that exposure to malaria prior to population expansion into the wider Pacific may have driven genetic selection for variants contributing to high serum urate.'

"This article analyses the role of education in incorporating Australia's Melanesian minority, the Torres Strait Islanders, into the Australian nation. The analysis begins with the introduction of Queensland government schooling into Torres Strait in 1892, which fostered expectations of Queensland citizenship and employment opportunities available to other races in the economy of the Strait. From 1904 to the outbreak of world war II in the Pacific in 1942 these early directions were altered by educational policies which initially sought to train Islanders for a life in the Islands as a \xe2\x80\x9crace apart\xe2\x80\x9d from the rest of Australia. Subsequent syllabus reforms, paralleling but not equalling regular schooling offered in Queensland, did not meet Islanders' aspirations for \xe2\x80\x9cproper schooling\xe2\x80\x9d and the jobs they expected would flow from it. Following world war II, regulations confining Islanders to the Strait were relaxed and many migrated to the Queensland mainland in search of better jobs, better pay, and better education for their children. Those who remained in the Islands received an education which, by 1985, had been brought up to the mainland standard. Yet, neither group's educational aspirations were satisfied despite initiatives and financial incentives of the Commonwealth government aimed at keeping Islander children at school. The article concludes that the way ahead for Islanders in staking out their educational future in the Australian nation on a basis of equality with other Australians lies in educational developments in the Islands themselves, where Islanders are playing an active role in developing, managing, and guiding schooling in directions which recognise their identity and their citizenship aspirations."

'The biodiversity hotspot concept was defined by Myers in 1988 to determine priority areas for conservation. They have high endemism levels and have lost more than 70% of their original vegetated area. To date, there is little information on arthropod diversity in these zones. This work focuses on the biodiversity of the Phytoseiidae (Acari), one of the best known among the order Mesostigmata, in these threatened areas. These mites are usually predators and they are worldwide spread. Geographic distribution of phytoseiids in 27 biodiversity hostspots was assessed from data of the last world catalogue published in 2004. One thousand two hundred and thirty species are reported from at least one hotspot (62% of the total species number) and 604 species (30% of the total species number) are endemic to the 27 hotspots considered. The number of reports/publication in hotspot areas (2.6) is higher than in non-hotspot zones (1.5). Hotspots areas could be thus considered as a great reservoir of the Phytoseiidae diversity, just as they are for vertebrates and plants. Correlations between plant, vertebrate, mite diversity and endemism, as well as congruence rates between endemism levels of these three organisms suggest that the biodiversity patterns of plants and vertebrates mirror well those of the Phytoseiidae (both for endemicity and species richness). More intense conservation efforts in biodiversity hotspots would thus be assumed to affect plant and vertebrate biodiversity, as already known, but also arthropod biodiversity, as it was assumed. These results further support thus the importance of these zones in biodiversity conservation, even for organisms like mites, very small and poorly studied in this regards. More data on arthropods are, however, required to confirm these preliminary observations.'

'The islands of North Maluku, Indonesia occupy a central position in the major prehistoric dispersal streams that shaped the peoples of Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Within this region a linguistic contact zone exists where speakers of Papuan and Austronesian languages reside in close proximity. Here we use population genetic data to assess the extent to which North Maluku populations experienced admixture of Asian genetic material, and whether linguistic boundaries reflect genetic differentiation today.'

'School mathematics tends to have developed from the major cultures of Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe. However, indigenous cultures in particular may have distinctly different systematic ways of referring to space and thinking mathematically about spatial activity. Their approaches are based on the close link between the environment and cultural activity. The affinity to place strengthens the efficient, abstract, mathematical system behind the reference and its connection to the real world of place and a holistic worldview. This paper sets out to present an overview of various approaches to aspects of space and geometry by drawing on linguistic and cultural literature, my collaborative research in Papua New Guinea, and from personal communications with indigenous colleagues in Australia and elsewhere. This diversity provides a challenge by which teachers can deconstruct their thinking about mathematics and subsequently to review the content of teaching and to be more responsive to the diversity of cultural backgrounds of students. To assist with recognising ecocultural mathematics on space and geometry, 4 principles are established and discussed on language structures, reference lines and points, measures of space and worldviews and interpretations of space as place.'

'In recent decades, Pacific Region indigenous sea tenure regimes have received considerable attention from social scientists who believe thatmarine-localized common entitlements and fishing practices can aid modern littoral fisheries management. The endorsement of sea tenure institutions as managerial tools, however, has proceeded without adequate consideration of their vulnerability to social and economic changes. The general view held by researchers is that Pacific Island sea tenure regimes are generally undermined by the influence of exogenous forces resulting in an open-access commons. In this article, it is argued that the contemporary transformation of sea tenure regimes emerges not only from exogenous agency, but from a complex set of autochthonous processes. A case study from New Georgia, Solomon Islands, is presented to show how sea tenure regimes can vary within an ethnically and culturally homogeneous region. Three tenure models are presented to show how different pre- and post-European contact regional settlement patterns, localized processes of political expansion and contraction, and dynamic indigenous sociocultural principles have resulted in institutional differences between each sea tenure model. The effect of the market economy on the organizational structure and managerial outcomes of each model also is discussed.'

'As an integral component of colonial culture, colonial architecture provides a tangible expression of western presence and domination throughout various colonial settings. In tropical colonies, such as Fiji, western architecture was not simply transplanted, but became transformed through the conscious integration of western and nonwestern architectural elements and grammars. Thus hybrid colonial architecture played a significant role within the sociopolitical strategies of both colonizer and colonized elites. Nasova House, the main government building of the autonomous Cakobau polity (1873\xe2\x80\x9374) and British colonial regime (1874\xe2\x80\x9382), provides a unique example of the use of colonial hybrid architecture in late nineteenth century Fiji.'

"There has been much recent debate about women's rights and their relation to human rights. Debates about domestic violence in Vanuatu are situated in this global frame but also in a regional and historical context dominated by the relation between kastom (tradition) and Christianity. This article depicts the dynamics of a conference on Violence and the Family in Vanuatu held in Port Vila in 1994, in terms of the competing claims of universal human rights and cultural relativism. The allegedly western character of human rights which focus on the individual and civil and political rights is often contrasted with the non-western stress on collectivities and the rights to economic development and self-determination. These sorts of ideological oppositions in international politics reverberate in domestic politics as well, and especially in those which situate women and men as subjects in conflict, as they are in many domestic disputes."

'Four types of ethnic conflict are found in the ten states of post-colonial Southeast Asia. Within these types, cases of peaceful accommodation, as well as forceful attempts to suppress rebellious minorities, are examined. Explanations for diverse governmental responses are found in geography, history, including colonial policies of divide and rule, and the nature of post-colonial governments. Some of the region\xe2\x80\x99s governments have shown great skill in devising peaceful methods of accommodation. But several military governments, unsuccessful at nation-building, have seen the forceful suppression of ethnic rebellions as their only option.'

'The western New Britain Trench contains relatively thin sediment fill in the east, compared to the west where a sequence of thick turbidites is ponded behind a basement high in the trench axis, The trench trends toward Huon Gulf, but intersects the Trobriand Trench at an acute angle at the 149\xc2\xb0 Embayment, where both trenches end. Seismic structure west of the trench is incoherent, related to incipient collision of the Indian-Australia Plate and the South Bismarck Plate. The collision suture is marked by the Markham Canyon, continuous in its upper reaches with the Ramu-Markham Fault Zone on shore.'

'Integration of petrographic and geochemical data on each island in the Banks Group, northern Vanuatu (New Hebrides) has revealed a decrease in K2O (and related incompatible elements) across the islands, away from the New Hebrides trench. The correlation with depth to the Benioff zone is therefore the reverse of that typically found in island arcs. REE evidence and source modelling indicates that this variation represents a progressive depletion in LREE/HREE in the upper mantle, laterally away from the trench and a progressive increase in partial melting of the source, in the same direction. These variations in chemistry are attributed to an earlier west-dipping Miocene subduction system, and the variation in degree of partial melting to the location of the islands with respect to the active back-arc basin. An enrichment of the upper mantle in the Miocene is ascribed to the ascent of hydrous fluids enriched in incompatible elements, from the west-dipping Benioff zone, and subsequent reaction with the overlying upper mantle. The model thus envisages approximately contemporaneous development of the Central Chain volcanoes and the backarc basin in the late Pliocene, with partial melting of hydrous, laterally zoned upper mantle resulting from the convective thermal regime associated with the rifting apart of the back-arc basin. The role of the present subduction regime in magma generation is considered to be very limited.'

'The Jarawas, a classical hunter-gatherer tribe of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, were living in isolation for several centuries. They came into contact with the civilized world recently. Serological studies carried out among them revealed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is hyper-endemic. The present study was carried out to investigate the possible origin of HBV infection in Jarawas. Genotyping, RFLP analysis, sequencing, and sequence analysis revealed the prevalence of HBV genotype C, similar to genotype C detected in Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar. In contrast, genotype D was prevalent among other non-Jarawa tribes of the island. These data suggest that HBV infection was transmitted from Indo-China to the Andaman Islands during migration of the Jarawas many centuries ago.'

'It has been suggested that Neel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthrifty genotype\xe2\x80\x9d model may account for high body weights in some Oceanic populations, which presumably arose in modern times. In European populations, common variants (rs1421085-C, rs17817449-G, and rs9939609-A) in the fat mass and obesity (FTO associated) were recently found to be associated with body mass index (BMI) or obesity. In this study, we investigated the population frequencies of these variants in six Oceanic populations (Melanesians, Micronesians, and Polynesians) and tested for an association with BMI. Unlike European populations, the Oceanic populations displayed no significant association between the FTO polymorphisms and BMI. These variants were in strong linkage disequilibrium. The population frequencies ranged between 4.2 and 30.3% in the six Oceanic populations, and were similar to those in southeast and east Asian populations. Our study of the FTO polymorphisms has generated no evidence to support the thrifty genotype hypothesis for Oceanic populations.'

'Despite the use of a wide range of different methodologies and diagnostic criteria, epidemiological studies have shown that Type 2 (non-insulindependent) diabetes has a global distribution and its prevalence varies from country to country, in different ethnic groups in the same country, and between the same ethnic group undergoing internal or external migration. Rural-urban and migration studies indicate that change towards a \xe2\x80\x98Westernized\xe2\x80\x99 lifestyle is associated with a dramatic increase in the prevalence rates for Type 2 diabetes. Between populations, comparisons are confounded by a wide range of different ascertainment rates, survey methodologies, and diagnostic criteria for diabetes. However, low prevalence rates for Type 2 diabetes are seen in Eskimos and populations of the Far East, while the highest are seen in American Indians, urbanized Pacific Island populations, and migrant Asian Indians. Available evidence suggests that these latter groups have a genetic susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes (\xe2\x80\x98diabetes genotype\xe2\x80\x99) and that the disease is unmasked by environmental factors. There appears to be a spectrum of interaction between genetic and environmental factors \xe2\x80\x94 in certain populations the genetic role may be more important than environmental, or vice versa. Epidemiological studies, apart from their value in population screenings and case-finding, have contributed to the new classification and diagnostic criteria for diabetes and our understanding of risk factors and host characteristics in the aetiology of Type 2 diabetes.'

'GLORIA and SeaMARC II sea-floor images of offshore Western Samoa reveal large-scale mass movements, volcanism, and structural modification. These processes are driven by hot-spot mantle diapirism and nearby plate subduction. Debris avalanche deposits extend from the island slope onto the adjacent abyssal plains, covering at least 20,000 km2. Sediment flows occur in sheets up to 30 km wide; slump structures are common on steep slopes. Volcanic cones and lava sheets are evident on lower slopes and abyssal plains. Major volcanic rift zones on the island of Savaii continue offshore. Subduction-induced flexure has produced intense tensional fracturing on the outer wall of the Tonga Trench.'

'Eleven species ofTerminalia are indigenous in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga ; the taxonomy is reviewed, with descriptions, keys, and distributional notes. Nine of the species occur in Fiji, and four of these,T. simulans,T. strigillosa,T. capitanea, andT. crebrifolia, are described as new.'

'Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with neurologic disorders including Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 syndrome (GBS). In New Caledonia during the ZIKV outbreak (2014\xe2\x80\x932015), case-control and retrospective studies have been performed to assess the link between ZIKV and GBS. Among the 15 cases included, 33% had evidence of a recent ZIKV infection compared to only 3.3% in the 30 controls involved. All patients were Melanesian, had facial diplegia and similar neurophysiological pattern consistent with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and recovered well. Furthermore, during the peak of ZIKV transmission, we observed a number of GBS cases higher than the calculated upper limit, emphasizing the fact that ZIKV is now a major trigger of GBS.'

'The exceptionally large gold resource at Ladolam (>1,300\xc2\xa0metric tons of gold), Lihir Island, resulted from the transition of an early-stage, low-grade porphyry gold system to a low-sulfidation epithermal gold event. This transition was probably triggered by rapid decompression during the partial slope failure of Luise stratovolcano and accompanied by the ingress of seawater. The original porphyry stage is indicated by remnant hydrothermal breccia clasts of strongly biotite\xe2\x80\x93magnetite altered monzodiorite with disseminated pyrite \xc2\xb1 chalcopyrite and poorly developed pyrite \xc2\xb1 quartz stockwork veins. The breccias are overprinted by biotite\xe2\x80\x93magnetite alteration and their matrix is strongly mineralized with disseminated auriferous pyrite. The breccias are cut by late-stage epithermal quartz\xe2\x80\x93chalcedony\xe2\x80\x93illite\xe2\x80\x93adularia\xe2\x80\x93pyrite veins and associated illite\xe2\x80\x93adularia alteration that locally contain bonanza gold grades of up to 120\xc2\xa0g/t. Isotope data suggest a magmatic source of sulfur in the gold-bearing fluids at Ladolam.

'The Cyclops massif (Irian Jaya - Western Indonesia) displays all components of an ophiolitic sequence including residual mantle peridotites (harzburgites and dunites), cumulate gabbros, dolerites, normal mid-oceanic ridge basalts (N-MORB) and minor amounts of boninitic lavas. This ophiolitic series tectonically overlies high temperature (HT)-high pressure (HP) mafic rocks metamorphosed during the Miocene.'

'Plant remains in the Arawe Islands were found preserved in waterlogged beach sediments. Remnants of edible fruit and wild nuts were found together with Lapita pottery, stone artifacts, and other evidence of human settlement. Previous discoveries of fruit and nut remains in Lapita pottery sites have been interpreted as evidence for an arboricultural complex based on a variety of tree species. Here we report direct evidence for plant use, but are unable to recognise any particular system of plant cultivation or harvest. All the genera and species recognised in the Arawe plant remains are known to enter modern beach drift by natural processes, from wild and cultivated sources. The archaeological assemblages pose intriguing problems for interpreting the history of plant use and domestication.'

'Recent archaeological research has fundamentally altered our understanding of the scope of past human impacts on nondomesticated animal populations. Predictions derived from foraging theory concerning the abundance histories of high-return human prey and diet breadth have been met in many parts of the world. People are known to have introduced a broad variety of nondomesticated animals, from sponges to agoutis and rats, to a remarkably broad set of contexts, in turn causing a wide variety of secondary impacts. By increasing the incidence of fire, human colonists have in some cases transformed the nature of the vegetation on the colonized landscape, in turn dramatically affecting animal populations on those landscapes. In island settings, these triple threats--predation, biotic introductions, and vegetation alteration--routinely led to extinctions but there is no archaeological evidence that small-scale societies caused extinction by predation alone on islands or continents. Indeed, the recent history of this famous argument suggests that it is better seen as a statement of faith about the past rather than as an appeal to reason. Perhaps most importantly, our burgeoning knowledge of past human impacts on animals has important implications for the conservation biology of the future.'

'The occurrence of kangaroos, wallabies and related species (Family Macropodidae) on islands of area 90 ha or more round Australia is non-random. Few islands adjacent to the northwestern, northern and eastern coasts have macropods present in contrast to a large number of islands near the mid-and southwestern coasts and most of the southern coastline. The latter group of islands was not visited by aborigines because they lacked watercraft, and most of the islands were apparently too small to support human populations. It is argued that Aboriginal man, through direct predation, his introduction of the Dingo, and his frequent use of fire, was chiefly responsible for the difference in representation of macropods on the two groups of islands.'

'Traditional medicines, the mainstay of medical treatment for virtually all minor ailments in many developing countries, have been tapped for the production of new therapeutics in the sustenance of human health and well-being. Vulnerable to the vicissitudes of globalization issues such as intellectual property rights, trade and gender are of relevance in the Pacific region that is a source of some unique traditional healing systems.'

'The goal of biodiversity hotspots is to identify regions around the world where conservation priorities should be focused. We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a 300\xc2\xa0m pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than 10\xc2\xa0% forest cover in protected areas. San F\xc3\xa9lix-San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests, Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than 500\xc2\xa0km2, forest cover is less than 50\xc2\xa0km2, and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions. This should improve our ability to compare, prioritize, and monitor forests in biodiversity hotspots.'

'Alphabetic literacy and Christianity were introduced to the Pacific Islands by Protestant missionaries in the early 19th century, and promulgated through mission schools and churches. Later colonial governments introduced literacy as the basis for secular authority, with written laws, treaties, land deeds, and other official documents. The post-colonial governments (1962-present) are demanding universal literacy in European languages through the introduced social institutions of education, government, law, and economics. This shift from oral to literate societies is contributing significantly to the erosion of traditional languages and cultures.'

'This paper examines the nineteenth- and twentieth-century non-indigenous presence in the Solomon Islands as an example of a maritime industrial frontier. In particular it employs a combination of frontier and maritime cultural landscape theories to consider the material and cognitive elements that inform us about how a maritime industrial frontier was shaped and operated, including the relationships between shipwrecks, maritime infrastructure, nodal points of activity and indigenous agency. The integrated analysis of these elements reveals distinct maritime patterns considered indicative of the broader economic, political and social concerns occurring on this frontier on the peripheries of the Western European World System.'

'The context for this paper is the nature of generalization deriving from the study of particular cases of human behaviour. With specific reference to field research on population movement conducted amongst individuals, households, small groups, and village communities in third world societies, it challenges the convention that both generalization and extrapolation are based inevitably and exclusively on the number of cases or events subject to examination. An evaluation is made of the methodological aspects of four different studies of population mobility at microscale, undertaken between 1965 and 1977 in the Solomon Islands and northwest Thailand. On this basis, integrated field designs that incorporate a range of intersecting instruments are favoured for their technical flexibility and logical strength. With case studies of third world villages, market centres, and urban neighbourhoods, generalization and extrapolation is based on depth of understanding and the power of theoretical connections.'

'While it is true that the vast majority of modern peoples learned of tobacco from Europeans, the southwest Pacific has two special cases where Europeans had almost nothing to do with the spread of tobacco or indeed nothing at all to do with it. In the relatively simple case of central Australia in the dry country of the \xe2\x80\x9coutback\xe2\x80\x9d the native Australians chewed the native tobaccos or its lookalike(Duboisea hopwoodii) all quite unaffected by or uninspired by Europeans or those affected by them. In this one remote area of the world American tobaccos never penetrated in their modern forms and in alliance with the habit of smoking. To such tribes as the Aranda and their brothers goes the distinction of being like the South American Indians, unique originators of habits of using tobacco.'

'This study aims to explore the potential of Dioscorea nummularia Lam. and to gather information as a prelude to its improvement by plant breeding. After a taxonomic clarification and a review of the botanical data, its geographical areas of origin and distribution are determined. A germplasm survey conducted on nine islands of Vanuatu enabled the collection of 110 accessions corresponding to 84 cultivars. These were grouped into: (1) wild forms under domestication, (2) annual types, (3) perennial-type cultivars of D. nummularia and (4) natural interspecific hybrids with D. alata L. Within each group, remarkable morphological variation exists for stem spininess, leaf shape, emerging leaf colour, tuber shape and tuber flesh colour. Selected accessions examined for ploidy had chromosome numbers ranging from 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa03x\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa060 to 2n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06x\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0120. Chloroplast counts conducted on stomatal guard cells confirmed the variation in ploidy levels. Eight different male cultivars were studied for pollen fertility, but <5% of the pollen grains appeared to be fertile when stained with acetocarmine. However, profuse flowering and synchrony favour pollination and result in fruit set. All accessions are resistant to anthracnose. Viruses were detected but are morphologically not discernible, with no incidence on yield. Physicochemical analyses of tubers from 16 accessions revealed that D. nummularia and interspecific hybrids have high percentages of dry matter (mean of 33.11%) and starch (82.81%). The Pacific yam could be improved through conventional hybridisation or used for interspecific crosses with related economically important species. Recommendations are made for further research.'

'Although mtDNA and the non-recombining Y chromosome (NRY) studies continue to provide valuable insights into the genetic history of human populations, recent technical, methodological and computational advances and the increasing availability of large-scale, genome-wide data from contemporary human populations around the world promise to reveal new aspects, resolve finer points, and provide a more detailed look at our past demographic history. Genome-wide data are particularly useful for inferring migrations, admixture, and fine structure, as well as for estimating population divergence and admixture times and fluctuations in effective population sizes. In this review, we highlight some of the stories that have emerged from the analyses of genome-wide SNP genotyping data concerning the human history of Southern Africa, India, Oceania, Island South East Asia, Europe and the Americas and comment on possible future study directions. We also discuss advantages and drawbacks of using SNP-arrays, with a particular focus on the ascertainment bias, and ways to circumvent it.'

'A comparison of head and body morphology on the ecologically uniform island of Kor\xc4\x8dula provides a good example of the balance that occurs in microevolution between selective pressures toward homogenization and selective inertia toward heterogeneity. thirty-eight measurements were made from a sample of 471 males and 526 females. Head variables, being more eco-stable than body variables, remain relatively more different between two distinct populations (eastern and western villages) than do the more eco-labile body variables, although both do vary significantly between east and west. The differences apply to both men and women. These east-west contrasts reflect the differential migration of Slavs to the island over the past three centuries, with a new wave of immigrants settling mainly in the east and introducing a new gene pool to the pre-existing Slavic hybrid population which had settled the island in the sixth to the eighth centuries. In addition to the predominant east-west differences in morphology, we also find significant variation between all villages in both head and body variables. We conclude that this is an indication of the considerable reproductive isolation that has persisted between all villages until the post-World War II period.'

"May 1987 is a month that will not be forgotten in the South Pacific. The first of two military coups d'etat led by Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka not only transformed the course of post-colonial political development in Fiji, but this event also had profound implications for international relations in the region. Co-incidentally, May 1987 was also the month when detailed results of Fiji's second national population census since Independence in 1970 became available. The 1986 census documents Fiji's population on the eve of a political revolution which has the potential to cause significant economic and social change. The demographic process most likely to be affected in the short-term by the coups is population movement, both within Fiji and to overseas destinations. This: paper examines developments in population movement between 1970 and 1986 with particular reference to an acceleration in levels of migration overseas by Indians and an exodus of Fijians from rural village communities for towns on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Trends in internal and international migration are evaluated at a range of spatial scales \xe2\x80\x94 national, regional and local. Some speculation on the effect of political and economic changes since May 1987 on these population movements attempts to provide a contemporary perspective on demographic developments over the last 15 years."

'Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis, Moraceae) is a traditional staple crop in Oceania and has been introduced throughout the tropics. This study examines important germplasm collections of breadfruit and its closest wild relatives and aims to (1) characterize genetic diversity, including identification of unknown and duplicate accessions, (2) evaluate genetic structure and hybridization within the breadfruit complex, and (3) compare utility of microsatellite markers to previously reported amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and isozyme markers in differentiating among cultivars. Data for 19 microsatellite loci were collected for 349 individuals (representing 255 accessions) including breadfruit (A. altilis), two wild relatives (Artocarpus camansi and Artocarpus mariannensis), and putative hybrids (A. altilis\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89A. mariannensis). Accessions were of mixed ploidy and regional origin, but predominantly from Oceania. Microsatellite loci collectively had a polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.627 and distinguished 197 unique genotypes sorted into 129 different lineages, but a single genotype accounts for 49\xc2\xa0% of all triploid breadfruit examined. Triploid hybrids and diploid A. altilis exhibited the highest levels of diversity as measured by allele number and gene diversity. Most accessions (75\xc2\xa0%) of unknown origin matched either a known genotype or lineage group in the collection. Putative hybrids all had genetic contributions from A. mariannensis but ranged in the level of genetic contribution from A. altilis. Microsatellite markers were found to be more informative than isozyme markers and slightly less informative, with regard to accession discrimination, than AFLP markers. This set of microsatellite markers and the dataset presented here will be valuable for breadfruit germplasm management and conservation.'

'Isozyme variation was studied in 1,417 cultivars and wild forms of taro collected in Asia and Oceania. Seven polymorphic enzyme systems (MDH, IDH, PGI, 6-PGD, ME, SkDH, and ADH) revealed 143 isozyme phenotypes, or zymotypes, each uniquely characterized by the presence or absence of 56 electromorphs. Results showed greater isozyme variation in Asia than in Oceania, with Indonesia being the area of greatest diversity. No correlations were found between zymotypes and morphotypes or ploidy levels (as described by other investigators). Multivariate analyses of the isozyme data indicated that the majority of the Indonesian cultivars were different from the Philippine and Oceanian taro cultivars. Oceanian cultivars constituted a continuum of clusters and are thought to have originated from a narrow genetic base introduced from Indonesia. If taro breeding is to have any future in Oceania, it is important to exchange genotypes to broaden the base of existing breeding programmes.'

'Different population groups of French Polynesia, Cook Islands and Fiji were screened for Human T-Lymphotropic Virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies. Among 1487 individuals sampled in French Polynesia, twelve were considered Western Blot (WB) indeterminate and one was considered WB-positive for HTLV-I infection. This positive subject originated from France and was a blood donor. Out of 196 Polynesians of the Cook Islands, one was WB-indeterminate. Among populations sampled in Fiji, one of 222 Melanesians was found WB-indeterminate and one of 211 Indians was WB-indeterminate.'

'Coupled human\xe2\x80\x93environmental timelines are used to explore the temporal coevolution of driving forces and adaptive strategies from the 1960s to 2006 on Bellona in the SW Pacific. Climatic events and agro-environmental conditions are assessed in conjunction with issues such as population dynamics, agricultural strategies, non-agricultural activities, transport and infrastructure, migration, education, political conditions, etc. Satellite imagery and aerial photos reveal relative stability in agricultural land use intensity despite an increase in de facto population (51% from 1966\xe2\x80\x932006). Results of questionnaire survey of 48 households show that the utilization of natural resources (notably shifting cultivation and fisheries) remains widespread, although it is increasingly supplemented by other income generating activities (e.g., shopkeeping, private business, government employment). Group interviews are used to discuss ways in which the local communities\xe2\x80\x99 adaptive resource management strategies have been employed in the face of climatic and socioeconomic events and changes in the recent past. Fifty years\xe2\x80\x99 development is described as a combination of continuity and change. Resource management practices are only marginally impacted by different stress factors, but the importance of agriculture has been decreasing in relative terms. Culturally determined bonds have become a main \xe2\x80\x98mechanism\xe2\x80\x99 to cope with environmental or socioeconomic stress and the Bellonese have become less vulnerable to external shocks.'

'There is considerable inter-ethnic variability in the incidence of CYP2C19 genetic poor metabolisers (var/var). About 3 per cent of Caucasians are CYP2C19 var/var. By contrast, an extremely high incidence (70 per cent) is observed in the Melanesian island of Vanuatu. The colonisation of the Pacific Islands is believed to have involved migration through Papua New Guinea (PNG), and hence a high incidence may also be expected in this population. The reported incidence in PNG was only 36 per cent, however. PNG is a country of extensive ethnic diversity, and the incidence of the CYP2C19 var/var in other regional populations of PNG is currently not established. In this study, restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction analysis of archival blood serum samples was used to determine the prevalence of the CYP2C19*2 and *3 variant alleles in three different ethnic and geographically isolated populations of PNG. In the largest population studied (Iruna), the frequency of both variant CYP2C19 alleles was high (0.37 and 0.34, respectively). Specifically, the frequency of the CYP2C19*3 allele was significantly higher than in the PNG (East Sepik) population reported previously (0.34 vs 0.16; p <0.0001). In the Iruna population, 48.9 per cent of the samples were homozygous variants for CYP2C19*2 or *3, which although higher was not statistically different from the East Sepik population (36 per cent). The results of this study indicated that other regional populations of PNG also have a relatively high incidence of the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism compared with Caucasian populations. The high incidence reported in Vanuatu, however, may be due to genetic drift rather than a PNG founder population, as the Vanuatu population is dominated by the CYP2C19*2 allele, with a lower contribution from the *3 allelic variant.'

'The Manus Basin in the eastern Bismarck Sea is a fastopening backarc basin behind the New Britain arc-trench system. Within the basin, motion between the Pacific and Bismarck plates about a pole located at 11\xc2\xb0 S, 145\xc2\xb0 E, occurs along three major leftlateral transform faults and a variety of extensional segments. We interpret SeaMARC II sidescan and other geophysical data to show that a Brunhes age plate reorganization created new extensional boundaries and a microplate between the NW-trending Willaumez, Djaul, and Weitin transforms. Two linked spreading segments formed in backarc basin crust between the Willaumez and Djaul transforms: the ESE-trending extensional transform zone (ETZ) in the west and the Manus spreading center (MSC) in the east. Positively magnetized crust on the MSC forms a wedge varying in width from 72 km at its southwest end to zero at its northeast tip, with corresponding Brunhes spreading rates varying from 92 mm/yr to zero. The MSC forms the northwestern boundary of the 100 km-scale Manus microplate and opens at 51\xc2\xb0/m.y. about a pole near its apex at 3\xc2\xb002\xe2\x80\xb2S, 150\xc2\xb032\xe2\x80\xb2E. Opposite the MSC, bordering the arc margin of New Britain, the microplate is bound by a zone of broadly distributed strike slip motion, extension, and volcanism. Within this area, the Southern Rifts contain a series of grabens partially floored by lava flows. Left-lateral motion between the Pacific and Bismarck plates appears to drive the counterclockwise pivoting motion of the Manus microplate and the complementary wedge-like opening of the MSC and the Southern Rifts. The pivoting motion of the microplate has resulted in compressional areas along its NE and SW boundaries with the Pacific and Bismarck plates respectively. East of the microplate, between the Djaul and Weitin transforms and within the arc margin of New Ireland, another zone of broad extension referred to as the Southeast Rifts takes up opening in a pull-apart basin. There, en echelon volcanic ridges may be the precursors of spreading segments, but erupted lavas include calcalkaline volcanics. Kinematic modeling and marine geophysical observations indicate that the responses to similar amounts of extension in the eastern Manus Basin have varied as a function of the different types of pre-existing crust: arc crust tectonically stretched over a broad area whereas backarc crust underwent relatively little stretching before accommodating extension by seafloor spreading.'

'In Plasmodium falciparum, resistance to chloroquine (CQ) is conferred by a K to T mutation at amino acid position 76 (K76T) in the P. falciparum CQ transporter (PfCRT). To date, at least 15 pfcrt genotypes, which are represented by combinations of five amino acids at positions 72-76, have been described in field isolates from various endemic regions. To identify novel mutant pfcrt genotypes and to reveal the genetic relatedness of pfcrt genotypes, a large-scale survey over a wide geographic area was performed.'

'Volcanogenic belts are structures that arise during the most important phases in the evolution of the lithosphere: intraoceanic, island-arc, continental-margin, and intracontinental belts. Apart from volcanogenic belts, there are widely occurring isolated local forms of volcanism (including deep-seated plume forms), which can be comparatively easily explained by the terrane concept. Contemporary notions of recent volcanism allow us to visualize our thoughts about paleovolcanological processes. However, one cannot gain deeper knowledge of recent volcanism, unless standing on the basis of the paleovolcanological foundation. Comparative analysis of the western and eastern sectors of the Pacific belt clearly illustrates its age and structural asymmetry of evolution. This paper discusses the most characteristic features of Pacific volcanism with special emphasis on contemporary oceanic and continental mineralization systems. V.V. Aver\xe2\x80\x99ev (1966) repeatedly stressed the need for the definition of volcanism to involve all deep-seated forms of magmatic processes, while he classified hydrothermal systems as a special kind of volcanism.'

'Studies on human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I (HTLV-I) and II (HTLV-II) are briefly reviewed from the viewpoint of molecular evolution, with special reference to the evolutionary rate and evolutionary relationships among these viruses. In particular, it appears that, in contrast to the low level of variability of HTLV-I among different isolates, individual isolates form quasispecies structures. Elucidating the mechanisms connecting these two phenomena will be one of the future problems in the study of the molecular evolution of HTLV-I and HTLV-II.'

'The distribution of bluetongue viruses (BTV) in Australia is represented by two distinct and interconnected epidemiological systems (episystems)\xe2\x80\x94one distributed primarily in the north and one in the east. The northern episystem is characterised by substantially greater antigenic diversity than the eastern episystem; yet the forces that act to limit the diversity present in the east remain unclear. Previous work has indicated that the northern episystem is linked to that of island South East Asia and Melanesia, and that BTV present in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and East Timor, may act as source populations for new serotypes and genotypes of BTV to enter Australia\xe2\x80\x99s north. In this study, the genomes of 49 bluetongue viruses from the eastern episystem and 13 from Indonesia were sequenced and analysed along with 27 previously published genome sequences from the northern Australian episystem. The results of this analysis confirm that the Australian BTV population has its origins in the South East Asian/Melanesian episystem, and that incursions into northern Australia occur with some regularity. In addition, the presence of limited genetic diversity in the eastern episystem relative to that found in the north supports the presence of substantial, but not complete, barriers to gene flow between the northern and eastern Australian episystems. Genetic bottlenecks between each successive episystem are evident, and appear to be responsible for the reduction in BTV genetic diversity observed in the north to south\xe2\x80\x93east direction.'

'Glendon Lean collated data on nearly 900 counting systems of Papua New Guinea, Oceania, and Irian Jaya (West Papua). Lean\xe2\x80\x99s data came from a questionnaire completed by students and talks with village elders. He read old documents written in English, German, and Dutch. He made comparisons between older and new accounts of the counting systems and compared neighbouring counting systems from both Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages. His work drew attention to the rich diversity of the systems and suggested that systems based on body parts and cyclic systems developed spontaneously. Digit tally systems were also relatively common. Lean\xe2\x80\x99s thesis on spontaneous developments of these ancient cultures challenged traditional theories describing the spread of number systems from Middle East cultures.'

'Anthropological and genetic data agree in indicating the African continent as the main place of origin for anatomically modern humans. However, it is unclear whether early modern humans left Africa through a single, major process, dispersing simultaneously over Asia and Europe, or in two main waves, first through the Arab Peninsula into southern Asia and Oceania, and later through a northern route crossing the Levant.'

'\nThis research investigated the sources of explanations and understanding of natural phenomena in terms of the students\xe2\x80\x99 cultural and school science experiences. The first phase involved interviews with eight village elders that probed their explanations and understanding of natural phenomena. The second phase involved the design, development and administration of two questionnaires on natural phenomena to 179 students in a rural boarding high school in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Most village elders gave explanations of many of the phenomena in terms of spirits, spells, magic, religion, and personal experiences. Most school-aged students choose scientific explanations of natural phenomena in terms of what they had learned in school or from personal experiences. However, many choose explanations of the same phenomena about spirits, spells and magic that came from the village, family or home. The study revealed that students\xe2\x80\x99 ideas about natural phenomena are strongly governed and controlled by their school science knowledge in the school setting. It is likely that their own traditional knowledge cannot be identified in a school setting but that questionnaires in the students\xe2\x80\x99 local language be given to students in their villages (as opposed to school). In addition, so as not to diminish the value of this traditional knowledge, science education programs are needed that are able to consider and harmonise traditional knowledge with school science.\n'

'A crustal attenuation model, initially proposed to explain the evolution of the Canadian margin of the Labrador Sea, is applicable to both intra-cratonic rift zones and passive continental margins. Examples examined are the East African rifts and the New Zealand Plateau, S. W. Pacific. In the model continental lithosphere is stretched and rifted over thermally and chemically expanding asthenosphere blisters. Magmas, abundantly generated in the zone of partial melting at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, ascend and intrude into the fracturing crust. Upon cooling, these intrusives produce low amplitude magnetic anomalies. Sea-floor spreading begins when the asthenosphere finally breaks through en masse and it is thus only a late phase in a much longer cycle. Attenuated continental crust is often underlain by low velocity, low density, upper mantle, which is indicative of the blending of the crust and mantle. It is suggested that substantial parts of marginal quiet magnetic zones are continent-ocean transitions that formed by crustal attenuation. The attenuation model is used to explain the evolution of the Arctic region. It should help bridge the gap between fixists and mobilists.'

'The colonization of Eurasia and Australasia by African modern humans has been explained, nearly unanimously, as the result of a quick southern coastal dispersal route through the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, and the Indochinese Peninsula, to reach Australia around 50 kya. The phylogeny and phylogeography of the major mitochondrial DNA Eurasian haplogroups M and N have played the main role in giving molecular genetics support to that scenario. However, using the same molecular tools, a northern route across central Asia has been invoked as an alternative that is more conciliatory with the fossil record of East Asia. Here, we assess as the Eurasian macrohaplogroup R fits in the northern path.'

' Archaeological research in the Kingdom of Tonga has documented a continuous sequence of human settlement, adaptation, and change for the period 2850\xe2\x80\x93150 B.P. Tongan culture history is synthesized using a four phase chronology that includes an Early Eastern Lapita Ceramic Period, a Polynesian Plain Ware Ceramic Period, an aceramic Formative Development Period, and a Complex Centralized Chiefdom Period. Beyond description of the archaeological record for this chronology, discussions center on a history of archaeological research in the Kingdom, a review of complementary data sources and approaches that inform upon the Tongan past, and an examination of Tongan data within the broader framework of Fijian/Western Polynesian prehistory. Problems and challenges for future archaeological studies in Tonga are identified as a conclusion. '

'Subduction related picrites from the New Georgia archipelago (Solomon Islands) range in bulk MgO from 13\xc2\xa0to 30\xc2\xa0wt%. Two generations of olivine are identified based on CaO contents: High-CaO olivine phenocrysts from the picritic parental melt and low-CaO olivine xenocrysts incorporated from either lithospheric or asthenospheric upper mantle. There is also evidence that some of the low-CaO olivines are boninitic in origin. The bulk MgO range in the picrites is largely controlled by assimilation of low-CaO olivine xenocrysts. Oxidation states of the melt (\xce\x94FMQ+2.2), calculated from magnetite activities in liquidus chromites, constrain the MgO content of the parental melt to 13\xc2\xa0wt%, assuming Fe\xe2\x80\x93Mg exchange equilibrium between melt and liquidus olivine composition. The dry liquidus temperature of the parent melt based on this MgO content is 1340\xc2\xb0C, about 80\xc2\xb0C above the temperature obtained with the olivine\xe2\x80\x93clinopyroxene Ca-exchange thermobarometer. The residence time of the low-CaO olivine xenocrysts in the magma, estimated from Ca- and Fe\xe2\x80\x93Mg interdiffusion profiles, did not exceed 1\xc2\xa0year.'

'The Managalase Plateau in north-east Papua is a faultbounded block of fractured basement metabasalt and basic plutonic rock overlain in the east by some thirty small volcanic centres of late Pleistocene to Recent age which include rhyodacite ash cones and trachybasalt and basaltic latite lava. To the north andesitic strato-volcanoes of Pleistocene and Recent age occur along the margin of the Cape Vogel geosyncline, whereas to the south a series of basaltic latite, alkali basalt and ultra-alkaline lava of Pliocene age margin the Papuan basic-ultrabasic belt.'

' Canarium indicum is an indigenous tree of the lowland forests of Melanesia (Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu) and parts of Indonesia producing edible nuts, commercial timber and some minor products. For thousands of years the nuts have been culturally important and a traditional food. Since the early 1990s there have been a number of projects aimed at the wider commercialization of the species, with mixed success. This review evaluates the biophysical and socio-economic literature and suggests how the domestication and commercialization processes could be taken forwards to improve the livelihoods of rural households in Melanesia. Many of the issues facing the domestication and commercialization of C. indicum nuts as an Agroforestry Tree Product (AFTP) are similar to those that will be important for the development of other AFTPs. Thus there are lessons that can be learnt from this species which make it a model for other agroforestry tree species.'

' Scholarly views on the prehistory of the Pacific Islanders are currently undergoing a major shift in perspective and underlying assumptions. This shift is driven by new research data and a need for new theoretical perspectives on space, time, and causal process. A new research agenda is coming to the fore, replacing the agenda guiding Pacific studies since the 1950s. Instead of looking at these islands as remote, undeveloped human colonies scattered across a vast and empty expanse of sea, we are finding that the Pacific was a notably early sphere of human accomplishments, on land and sea, where the ocean was more an avenue than a barrier for cultural interchange. The roots of this new perspective can be traced back, in part, to the Wenner-Gren/Smithsonian conference on human biogeography held in Washington, D.C., in 1974. '

'Distribution of a 27-bp deletion in the band 3 gene (B3\xce\x9427) that causes Southeast Asian/Melanesian ovalocytosis has scarcely been studied in remote insular Southeast Asia and New Guinea. Here the presence of the B3\xce\x9427 was surveyed among a total of 756 subjects from the indigenous populations inhabiting New Guinean islands and remote insular Southeast Asia by using a polymerase chain reaction method. In remote insular Southeast Asia where Austronesian-speaking peoples inhabit, the B3\xce\x9427 frequency ranged between 0.04 and 0.15. In New Guinea Island, hinterland or Papuan groups showed the absence of the B3\xce\x9427 or a very low gene frequency (0.01 in the Gidra) of the B3\xce\x9427. However, groups of the coastal regions (Asmat, Sorong, and others) and of the nearby islands (Biak and Manus) where Austronesian infiltration had occurred showed substantial frequencies of the deletion (0.02\xe2\x80\x930.09). It is likely that the B3\xce\x9427 was introduced into this region about 3,500 years ago with the arrival of Austronesian-speaking peoples. Once being introduced, the B3\xce\x9427 may have been selected because of its resistance against malaria, while founder effect and genetic drift might have occurred in the New Guinean tribes with small population size, which helped to generate a variety of the B3\xce\x9427 frequencies.'

'Genetic affinity of human populations based on allele frequency data was studied from two viewpoints. (1) The effect of the number of polymorphic loci on the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree of human populations was empirically investigated. Genetic affinity trees were constructed based on data for 1\xe2\x80\x9312 polymorphic loci, by using the neighbor-joining method. Geographical clustering of populations gradually appeared when the number of loci was increased. A new classification and terminology of higher order human population clusters is proposed based on these and other studies. (2) A new method of estimating the absolute divergence time of two populations is proposed, which is based on a diffusion equation that describes random genetic drift.'

'The patterns of climate change in the Asia-Pacific region simulated by versions of the CSIRO Mk3.5 and Mk3.0 climate models are examined and compared with those from 23 CMIP3 models. Using fields standardized by global warming, it is seen that both CSIRO coupled models simulate larger surface warming in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, and smaller warming in the eastern Indian Ocean, than the CMIP3 average, and also model versions with a mixed-layer ocean. Corresponding differences in the changes in the pressure, winds, rainfall and other quantities were simulated. Introducing the coupled Mk3.5\xe2\x80\x99s sea surface temperature field for the present climate, which has a warm bias, as the base climate for the MLO version had only a minor effect on the MLO version\xe2\x80\x99s pattern of climate change. A Pacific-Indian Dipole index quantifying the amplitude of the warming pattern explains much of the variation in rainfall change simulated by the CMIP3 models over Australia and the Indonesian and Melanesian regions. It relates more strongly to Australian average rainfall than several other indices representing southern hemispheric circulation changes. The decline in Australian rainfall produced by the full ocean coupling is largest in summer, but occurs in each season, and extends across the continent. Further assessment of the importance of the dipole change pattern in new simulations is warranted. Analyses aimed at reducing the uncertainty in its potential amplitude could help narrow the range of projections for change in the Australasian region.'

'This study surveys the micromorphological surface structure of the leaves of the conifer genusAgathis (Araucariaceae) from throughout the range of the genus (Malaysia to New Zealand and Fiji) as seen with the scanning electron microscope. These data confirm that the vegetative parts ofAgathis are taxonomically highly conservative, but suggest the Melanesian and New Zealand elements to be distinctive from those of the rest of the genus, and from one another. Conclusions are compared with those that have been derived from studies based on other characters.'

'More than 11000 blood samples have been examined for glutamicpyruvic transaminase (GPT) and almost 9000 for Esterase D (EsD) in the Asian-Pacific area; GPT 3  and GPT 6  were detected in several population groups in New Guinea, Singapore and some Pacific islands. No previously undescribed alleles were found in either system.'

"Madagascar's culture is a unique fusion of elements drawn from the western, northern, and eastern shores of the Indian Ocean, and its past has fascinated many scholars, yet systematic archaeological research is relatively recent on the island. The oldest traces of visitors are from the first century AD. Coastal settlements, with clear evidence of ties to the western Indian Ocean trading network, were established in several places over the next millennium. Important environmental changes of both plant and animal communities are documented over this period, including the extinctions of almost all large animal species. Urban life in Madagascar began with the establishment of the entrep\xc3\xb4t of Mahilaka on the northwest coast of the island in the twelfth century. At about the same time, communities with ties to the trade network were established around the island's coasts. From the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, social hierarchies developed in several regions of the island. During the succeeding two centuries, Madagascar saw the development of state polities."

'In the coastal waters of Central Vietnam, the genus Ariosoma Swainson is represented by three known species (A. anago (Temminck et Schlegel), A. meeki (Jordan et Snyder), and A. megalops Fowler) and by a new species described recently A. dolichopterum Karmovskaya). The brief descriptions of three former species and the maps of their distribution (adult individuals and larval forms) in the South China Sea and waters of the Western Pacific, from Japan to Australia, are presented.'

'In the Late Cretaceous starting from the early Coniacian, three parallel suprasubduction structural units have developed contemporaneously in the northwestern Paleopacific framework: (1) the Okhotsk-Chukchi arc at the Asian continental margin, (2) the West Kamchatka and Essoveem ensialic arcs at the northwestern margins of the Kamchatka and Central Koryak continental blocks, and (3) the Achaivayam-Valagin ensimatic arc that extended to the southwest as the Lesser Kuril ensialic arc at the southern margin of the Sea of Okhotsk continental block. In this setting, the geodynamics of the Paleopacific plates exerted an effect only on the evolution of the outer (relative to the continent) ensimatic island arc, whereas the vast inner region between this arc and the continent evolved independently. As is seen from the character of the gravity field and seismic refractor velocity, the Kamchatka and Sea of Okhotsk continental blocks differ in the structure of the consolidated crust. These blocks collided with each other and the Asian continent in the middle Campanian (77 Ma ago). The extensive pre-Paleogene land that existed on the place of the present-day Sea of Okhotsk probably supplied the terrigenous material deposited since the late Campanian on the oceanic crust of the backarc basin to the south of the rise of inner continental blocks as the Khozgon, Lesnaya, and Ukelayat flysch complexes. The accretion of the Olyutor (Achaivayam) and Valagin segments of the ensimatic arc had different consequences due to the difference in thickness of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s crust. The Valagin segment was formed on an older basement and had a much greater thickness of the crust than the Olyutor segment. As follows from computations and the results of physical modeling, the island arcs having crust more than 25 km in thickness collide with the continental margin and are thrust over the latter. In the case under consideration, the thrusting of the Valagin segment led to metamorphism of the underlying rocks. The crust of the Olyutor segment was much thinner. The contact of this segment with the continental margin resulted only in surficial accretion, which did not bring about metamorphism, and the underlying lithospheric plate continued to plunge into the subduction zone.'

'We investigate eruptive activity by analysis of thermal-alert data from the MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectrometer) thermal infrared satellite instrument, detected by the MODVOLC (MODIS Volcano alert) algorithm. These data are openly available on the Internet, and easy to use. We show how such data can plug major gaps in the conventional monitoring record of volcanoes in an otherwise generally poorly documented region (Melanesia), including: characterising the mechanism of lava effusion at Pago; demonstrating an earlier-than-realised onset of lava effusion at Lopevi; extending the known period of lava lake activity at Ambrym; and confirming ongoing activity at Bagana, Langila and Tinakula. We also add to the record of activity even at some generally better-monitored volcanoes in Indonesia, but point out that care must be taken to recognise and exclude fires.'

'Tandem-repetitive highly variable loci in the human genome (minisatellites) have been used in gene mapping and as DNA \xe2\x80\x9cfingerprints\xe2\x80\x9d, but they have not yet found much application in population genetics. We have investigated the capacity of six minisatellites to discriminate between four populations in Oceania. We find that in comparison to Melanesians, Polynesians have a significant loss of heterozygosity (or gene diversity), not noted using more traditional markers. We show also that the number of alleles, the allele distribution and the mutation rates at the Polynesian minisatellite loci do not deviate from those predicted by the neutral mutation/infinite allele model. The low gene diversity is therefore likely to be a result of the maintenance of small population sizes and bottleneck effects during the colonization of the Pacific.'

'This first study of the whole genusAgathis makes use of recent local revisions of the New Caledonian and Australian species which are all maintained. The male cone is shown to have most of the taxonomically useful variation, and this confirms the findings of two partial revisions centred on Indonesian species. Thirteen species are recognized, two of which have two subspecies. New Caledonia has five, and Australia three, sympatric species. Otherwise the species are allopatric except for a few populations of central MalesianA. dammara within the range of west MalesianA. borneensis. One of these montane populations is the distinctiveA. dammara subsp.flavescens of Malaya, formerly a full species.'

'Access to surgical care and emergency obstetrical care is limited in low-income countries. The Solomon Islands is one of the poorest countries in the Pacific region. Access to surgical care in Solomon Islands is limited and severely affected by a country made up of islands. Surgical care is centralized to the National Referral Hospital (NRH) on Guadalcanal, leaving a void of care in the provinces where more than 80% of the people live.'

"The ability to infer personal genetic ancestry is being increasingly utilised in certain medical and forensic situations. Herein, the unsupervised Bayesian clustering algorithms structure, is employed to analyse 377 autosomal short tandem repeats typed on 1,056 individuals from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain Human Diversity Panel. Individuals of known geographical origin were hierarchically classified into a framework of increasingly homogeneous clusters to serve as reference populations into which individuals of unknown ancestry can be assigned. The groupings were characterised by the geographical affinities of cluster members and the accuracy of these procedures was verified using several genetic indices. Fine-scale substructure was detectable beyond the broad population level classifications that previously have been explored in this dataset. Metrics indicated that within certain lines, the strongest structuring signals were detected at the leaves of the hierarchy where lineage-specific groupings were identified. The accuracy of unknown assignment was assessed at each level of the hierarchy using a 'leave one out' strategy in which each individual was stripped of cluster membership and then re-assigned using the supervised Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in GeneClass2. Although most clusters at all levels of resolution experienced highly accurate assignment, a decline was observed in the finer levels due to the mixed membership characteristics of some individuals. The parameters defined by this study allowed for assignment of unknown individuals to genetically defined clusters with measured likelihood. Shared ancestry data can then be inferred for the unknown individual."

'The gene PPARGC1A, in particular the Gly482Ser variant (rs8192678), had been proposed to be subject to natural selection, particularly in recent progenitors of extant Polynesian populations. Reasons include high levels of population differentiation and increased frequencies of the derived type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk 482Ser allele, and association with body mass index (BMI) in a small Tongan population. However, no direct statistical tests for selection have been applied.'

'Invasion into new areas by already widespread pest organisms often occurs through non-obvious routes, with the origins of such invasions difficult to determine. Understanding population structure using multiple datatypes can help untangle past dispersal events and reveal putative contemporary invasion pathways. The tephritid fruit fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett), is a serious pest of cucurbits and other commercial crops and is considered native to the Indo-Oriental region, but is invasive in both Africa and the Pacific. Here, we combine molecular (microsatellites and COI) and morphological (male genetalia length and wing shape geometric morphometrics) data within an integrative taxonomic framework to test hypotheses concerning levels of Z. cucurbitae population variation observed in Southeast Asia (native range, 10 sites, ~200 individuals) versus the West Pacific (invasive range, 4 sites, ~80 individuals), and whether single or multiple introductions of Z. cucurbitae have occurred into the West Pacific. We also use this case to explicitly test if using an integrative approach provides more information about hypothesized invasion pathways than either genetic or morphological approaches would do alone. All datasets support Z. cucurbitae as being more variable in Southeast Asia than the West Pacific, and within these regions populations appear to be structured geographically. In particular, mainland and Sundaic Southeast Asian locations formed separate clusters, and New Guinea and Solomon Islands were not closely related to Guam and Hawaii. Evidence supports a separate single origin for New Guinea from the Melanesian arc, the Solomon Islands from Malaysia/Singapore, and Guam from mainland Asia, but multiple introductions into Hawaii from mainland Asia. Taken together, we argue that there is great value in integrating evidence from multiple sources as it can provide finer resolution of population relationships than any single data source alone.'

'Communitarians have alleged a connection between according specialrights to community groupings and preserving the indigenous cultureand the social cohesion of the original community. This paperconcentrates upon special group rights associated with land tenurenow maintained by Fijian Mataqali and traditional land owninggroups in Papua New Guinea. The first section of the paper assessesand compares the social consequences of each of these systems withspecial attention to the preservation of traditional culture.However, in the case of Fiji, it is undeniable that the mataqaliland tenure system has given indigenous Fijians politicaladvantages over non-indigenous Fijians, most specifically theFijian Indians. Though special land rights can possibly bejustified on the grounds of cultural preservation, their existencedoes raise this further issue of fairness. Moral considerations basedupon the territorial sovereignty of indigenous nations, rather thancommunitarian arguments, may offer a more convincing justificationof the advantages of indigenous Fijians.'

'Archaeological research on a prefabricated timber church on Tanna Island, Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides) has revealed details about site history, construction, use life, and current condition.

Two volcanic cones are active almost continuously and historic fissure cruptions have been recorded.'

'Sea turtles are one of the largest vertebrates in the shallow water ecosystems of Remote Oceania, occurring in both sea grass pastures and on coral reefs. Their functional roles, however, over ecological and evolutionary times scales are not well known, in part because their numbers have been so drastically reduced. Ethnographic and archaeological data is analysed to assess long-term patterns of human\xe2\x80\x93sea turtle interactions (mainly green and hawksbill) prior to western contact and the magnitude of turtle losses in this region. From the ethnographic data two large-scale patterns emerge, societies where turtle capture and consumption was controlled by chiefs and priests versus those where control over turtle was more flexible and consumption more egalitarian. Broadly the distinction is between societies on high (volcanic and raised coral) islands versus atolls, but the critical variables are the ratio of land to shallow marine environments, combined with the availability of refugia. Archaeological evidence further highlights differences in the rate and magnitude of turtle losses across these two island types, with high islands suffering both large and rapid declines while those on atolls are less marked. These long-term historical patterns help explain the ethnographic endpoints, with areas that experienced greater losses apparently developing more restrictive social controls over time. Finally, if current turtle migration patterns held in the past, with annual movements between western foraging grounds and eastern nesting beaches, then intensive harvesting from 2,800 Before Present in West Polynesia probably affected turtle abundance and coral reef ecology in East Polynesia well before the actual arrival of human settlers, the latter a process that most likely began 1,400\xc2\xa0years later.'

'Control region polymorphisms in the mitochondrial DNA of 124 unrelated individuals from the Malay population living in or around Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia were investigated and phylogenetic haplogroup lineages were determined. The intergenic COII/tRNALys 9-bp deletion, 3010 and 5178 mutations, and several coding region polymorphisms were examined to discriminate some phylogenetic haplogroups. Sequence comparison of the control regions led to the identification of 117 mitochondrial haplotypes, in which 103 types were observed in only one individual and the other nine types were shared by more than two individuals. Gene diversity was estimated to be 0.997. Phylogenetic haplogroup determination revealed that the gene pool of the modern Malay population in Malaysia consisted mainly of southeast Asian, east Asian, unidentified and unique, and aboriginal southeast-specific haplogroups. These results suggest a multi-original nature for the modern Malay population. The present database may help not only in personal identification but also in determining geographic origin in forensic casework in Malaysian, Southeast Asian and East Asian populations.'

'Between 1987 and 2006 Fiji experienced four coups in which Governments were overthrown by their military forces or parts of it. After the fourth coup in December 2006 old metropolitan friends such as Australia, New Zealand, the USA and the EU responded with travel sanctions, cancellation of military cooperation and frozen development assistance. When Fiji was politically isolated it fostered secondary political friendships of olden days and established new ones. The paper searches for evidence of Fiji\xe2\x80\x99s agency to change the structure of its International Relations (IR) after the coup of 2000. Such relations were first shaped in Prime Minister Qarase\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Look North\xe2\x80\x99 policy, but following the coup of December 2006 Fiji\xe2\x80\x99s IR took a new quality once political isolation was overcome and internal power stabilized. The paper concentrates on Indo-Fijian relations, which, however, are embedded in Fiji\xe2\x80\x99s general effort to achieve greater independence from old friends by forcing new international relationships. Of particular interest in this context is, if Fiji\xe2\x80\x99s political orientation after 2006 has just been a temporary necessity born out of political isolation or if Fiji\xe2\x80\x99s policy of fostering South\xe2\x80\x93South relations will remain a decisive element of the country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy in the long term. To understand IR in the context of Fiji and India it is essential to look at both countries, their interests and agency. Looking at Fiji alone would leave the question unanswered, why Indian Governments had an interest to cooperate with the country in the Pacific Islands despite hard-core nationalist anti-Indian sentiments and politics pursued in Fiji after the coup of 2000. It also won\xe2\x80\x99t be conclusive why India should be interested at all to foster high profile relations with a tiny country like Fiji in a situation when Indian governments were aiming at much higher goals.'

'Coral reef fish taxonomy from 1980 to 2014 is reviewed, providing a subjective analysis of new species descriptions, including statistics on the rate of new discoveries, which families and genera have attracted the most taxonomic interest, the main geographic areas for new discoveries, which journals the new taxa were published in, the nationality of authors, the most productive authors, and the main focal areas for reef fish field work.'

'Taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott), cultivated in V\xc3\xaatuboso, a village of northern Vanuatu, Melanesia, was surveyed to: (1) assess the extent of morphological and molecular variation being maintained by growers at the village level and, (2) compare this diversity with the diversity found in the crops in Vanuatu. Ethnobotanical data were combined with AFLP analysis to elucidate possible sources of variation. Folk assessment of variation is based on: (a) morphological characteristics (11 characters), (b) names and (c) classification according to habitat, uses, origin and agronomic adaptation. This 3-fold approach allowed growers to differentiate 96 morphotypes, all of which are given distinct vernacular names. AFLP fingerprints successfully differentiated all these 96 morphotypes which do not present a significant intra-clonal variation. But genetic results showed no clear groupings according to geographic origin or habitat of morphotypes and stated that the diversity found within the village was comparable with the overall diversity found in Vanuatu. Local nomenclature and stories associated with each cultivar suggested three sources of diversity: introductions (38%), somatic mutations (15%) and sexual recombinations (48%). AFLP results confirm folk beliefs  about origin at least for three pairs of mutants. The 11 so-called wild forms analysed by AFLP were suggested to be feral, escapes from domestication. A dynamic in situ conservation strategy (DISC), favouring a broadening of the national genetic base, was discussed for taro.'

'Two major magma series are recognised in the northeastern Carribean island arcs and correlated with numerous examples elsewhere, mainly in the western Pacific. The Primitive Island Arc (PIA) series is apparently the oldest in each of its island-arc occurrences and is followed by the calcalkaline (CA) series, which locally co-occurs with a high-potassium (HK) variety, especially in topographically larger island areas. Also occurring in the northeastern Caribbean are tectonically emplaced examples of metamorphosed mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) and a diabase dike swarm possibly related to a rifting event.'

'There are two very different interpretations of the prehistory of Island Southeast Asia (ISEA), with genetic evidence invoked in support of both. The \xe2\x80\x9cout-of-Taiwan\xe2\x80\x9d model proposes a major Late Holocene expansion of Neolithic Austronesian speakers from Taiwan. An alternative, proposing that Late Glacial/postglacial sea-level rises triggered largely autochthonous dispersals, accounts for some otherwise enigmatic genetic patterns, but fails to explain the Austronesian language dispersal. Combining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome and genome-wide data, we performed the most comprehensive analysis of the region to date, obtaining highly consistent results across all three systems and allowing us to reconcile the models. We infer a primarily common ancestry for Taiwan/ISEA populations established before the Neolithic, but also detected clear signals of two minor Late Holocene migrations, probably representing Neolithic input from both Mainland Southeast Asia and South China, via Taiwan. This latter may therefore have mediated the Austronesian language dispersal, implying small-scale migration and language shift rather than large-scale expansion.'

'We conducted a survey for malaria diagnosis and treatment in four primary schools in Flores Island, one of the Indonesian Islands with an area of 17,000\xc2\xa0km2 and a population of 1.8 million. Of those examined, 24.4% were diagnosed as having malaria (90/363) and administered medicine immediately. A glucose-6-phophate dehydrogenase (G6PD) test was performed at the same time, and 16 persons (4.4%) were diagnosed as G6PD deficient. Eleven persons consented to analysis of the G6PD genome. We analyzed these subjects and found one case of G6PD Vanua Lava (383T>C), five cases of G6PD Coimbra (592C>T), one case of G6PD Viangchan (871G>A), one case of G6PD Chatham (1003G>A), and three cases of G6PD Kaiping (1388G>A). These were unexpected findings because five different G6PD variants were found in such a small population. This suggests that people of Flores Island are derived from various ancestries.'

'Yami and Ivatan islanders are Austronesian speakers from Orchid Island and the Batanes archipelago that are located between Taiwan and the Philippines. The paternal genealogies of the Yami tribe from 1962 monograph of Wei and Liu were compared with our dataset of non-recombining Y (NRY) chromosomes from the corresponding families. Then mitochondrial DNA polymorphism was also analyzed to determine the matrilineal relationships between Yami, Ivatan, and other East Asian populations.'

'A model of the subsistence economy of an insular population is proposed in which the various factors that might influence the potential carrying capacity of the environment are made explicit as a set of ecological and cultural constraints on subsistence production. The application of the model to the Polynesian Outlier Atolls is discussed, and a formula is suggested whereby the population potential of any stable and bounded ecosystem can be calculated, using data on agricultural area, productivity, and diets. The actual size of precontact populations of the Outliers and other atolls appears to have been 70\xe2\x80\x9380% of the predicted carrying capacity, which accords well with ethnographic evidence for population homeostasis.'

'Serum samples collected in 1984 during a malariometric survey of two villages in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea were tested for antibodies to HTLV-I. None of the villagers showed any symptoms suggestive of retrovirus infection. Eighteen of the 186 (9.5%) sera tested at that time were found to be positive. Blood samples were subsequently obtained from fifteen of the eighteen positives and subjected to analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmuno assay (RIA), radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), and Western blot (WB). Fourteen of the fifteen gave a positive ELISA response, but none were unequivocally positive by p 24 RIA. All sera tested were reactive togag antigens by WB, but gave \xe2\x80\x9cindeterminate\xe2\x80\x9d results currently accepted criteria. Notably absent from the WB profiles of all of the study subjects was an antibody response to HTLV-I envelope protein gp 46. It is possible that these antibody responses are directed against a variant of HTLV-I or to a novel retrovirus which possesses core antigens similar to those of HTLV-I but has different envelope antigens. Until a virus is isolated, or the viral genome is identified in infected lymphocytes, the possibility remains that the response may be due to factors unrelated to retrovirus infection.'

'Contrary to other unisexual vertebrates except a little-known fossorial snake, the Indo-Pacific anthropophilous, parthenogenetic lacertilian Lipododactylus lugubris is vastly more widespread than its bisexual relatives. At the same time, it shows negligible enzyme polymorphism and low overall heterozygosity in its usual diploid condition, which suggests the possibility that hybridization did not intervene when thelytoky was brought about. Clones are in much higher proportion among the sympatric triploids, but they too have a low relative heterozygosity, compounded by gene dosage restriction since no more than two out of the three alleles have been found expressed at any locus. Isozyme data suggest an origin of the complex in South East Asia, which conclusion is substantiated by the presence of a bisexual sibling species in the Philippine Islands.'

'This paper explores the geographic and environmental context of the Southern Dispersal Route, which has been proposed as a migratory route for Homo sapiens from East Africa to Australasia during oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 4 (71\xe2\x80\x9359\xc2\xa0kyr). A series of assumptions and constraints garnered from modern hunter-gatherer observations are used to build a model of coastal foragers, which is then integrated with high-resolution physiographic analyses to produce a potential dispersal route along the coastline of the Indian Ocean. Paleoenvironmental conditions that may have supplied critical resources or served as obstacles to human colonization are identified and discussed in regards to human subsistence, the speed of migration, and demographic expansion. These factors suggest that rapid dispersals along coastlines and river valleys would have occurred upon the initial expansion out of Africa, but slowed as populations expanded demographically into South Asia and the Sunda Shelf. This also suggests that archaeological signatures relating to the earliest modern Homo sapiens are more likely to be recovered in South Asia.'

'Harvesting different species as foods or raw materials calls for differing skills depending on the species being harvested and the circumstances under which they are being taken. In some situations and for some species, the tactics used are mainly behavioral\xe2\x80\x94that is, people adjust, or adapt, their own actions to fit the behavior and circumstances of the species they are taking. Under other circumstances and for other species, the skills and tactics used may call for greater environmental preparation or manipulation. Therefore, instead of trying to distinguish people today and in the past as either \xe2\x80\x9cforagers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfarmers,\xe2\x80\x9d it makes sense to define human subsistence behavior as an interactive matrix of species and harvesting tactics, that is, as a provisions spreadsheet.'

'Despite the increasing need to prevent obesity and oral diseases in adolescents worldwide, few studies have investigated the link existing between these conditions and their common risk factors. This study aims to evaluate the oral health and weight status of New Caledonian Children (aged 6,9,12\xc2\xa0years) and to identify, amongst 12-year-olds, risk indicators that may characterize the groups of children affected by oral diseases, obesity or both diseases.'

'Over the last 20 years, the United States has become a focus for Pacific Island migration. A demographic profile of migrants (according to the latest available figures, those from the 1980 Census) is presented along with reasons for migration. This is followed by an account of the typical social organization of a Samoan migrant community. Clashes that sometimes arise between core Samoan and American values are explored. Ethnic identity is shown to be both a strength and a stressor in Samoan migrant adaptation. Complex but ever-changing links between the migrant population and home island residents are investigated. Implications for service delivery to an aging population of Pacific Islanders are discussed.'

'In forensic anthropology, ancestry estimation is essential in establishing the individual biological profile. The aim of this study is to present a new program\xe2\x80\x94AncesTrees\xe2\x80\x94developed for assessing ancestry based on metric analysis. AncesTrees relies on a machine learning ensemble algorithm, random forest, to classify the human skull. In the ensemble learning paradigm, several models are generated and co-jointly used to arrive at the final decision. The random forest algorithm creates ensembles of decision trees classifiers, a non-linear and non-parametric classification technique. The database used in AncesTrees is composed by 23 craniometric variables from 1,734 individuals, representative of six major ancestral groups and selected from the Howells\xe2\x80\x99 craniometric series. The program was tested in 128 adult crania from the following collections: the African slaves\xe2\x80\x99 skeletal collection of Valle da Gafaria; the Medical School Skull Collection and the Identified Skeletal Collection of 21st Century, both curated at the University of Coimbra. The first step of the test analysis was to perform ancestry estimation including all the ancestral groups of the database. The second stage of our test analysis was to conduct ancestry estimation including only the European and the African ancestral groups. In the first test analysis, 75\xc2\xa0% of the individuals of African ancestry and 79.2\xc2\xa0% of the individuals of European ancestry were correctly identified. The model involving only African and European ancestral groups had a better performance: 93.8\xc2\xa0% of all individuals were correctly classified. The obtained results show that AncesTrees can be a valuable tool in forensic anthropology.'

'Tarsiers (Tarsius) and slow lorises (Nycticebus) are the only extant nocturnal primates occurring in Southeast Asia. Harcourt (1999) hypothesized that in insular Southeast Asia, slow lorises and tarsiers showed a checkerboard distribution on 12 small (<12,000\xc2\xa0km2) islands, i.e., only one or the other occurs, and attributed this to extreme levels of competition between these 2 largely faunivorous primates. Further, he predicted slow lorises were able to persist on smaller islands than tarsiers. We re-evaluated these findings using an expanded dataset including 49 islands where tarsiers or slow lorises occur. Tarsiers and slow lorises live on islands of similar size (median size of ca. 300\xe2\x80\x93900\xc2\xa0km2), and both taxa inhabit an equal proportion of small, medium, and large islands. On small islands within their area of sympatry tarsiers occur on 1 island, slow lorises on 8, both genera on 3, and we can assume they have become extinct from 11 small islands since the Last Glacial Maximum. Sizes of islands where tarsiers or slow lorises have become extinct do not differ from islands where they are still extant. We show that slow lorises occur on more islands in insular Southeast Asia than perhaps previously assumed, but these islands are not smaller on average than islands where tarsiers occur. A checkerboard distribution between these taxa is not evident. More studies are needed at the macroecological level to assess the importance of biogeographic history in explaining their present-day distribution patterns.'

'The literature of stone tool procurement and technology published in the past decade is reviewed in this article. The presentation attempts to be geographically comprehensive but, because of where it was written, it provides fuller coverage of New World publications, particularly those from North America, than of literature from the rest of the world. Topics covered include raw materials and procurement, flake experimentation, technology, and specific tool types. An article in a subsequent issue of this journal will discuss issues of function, behavior, and classification in lithic analysis.'

'Asmat hunter-gatherers of Irian Jaya have been experiencing rapid culture change since 1953, yet demographically still can be classified as \xe2\x80\x9cliving primitives.\xe2\x80\x9d Methods of nonstandard data analysis are utilized in an attempt to provide specific information on age-sex structure, fertility, birth rates, death rates, population growth, internal migration, and life expectancy in the contact era, and to aid in the development of a two-part model of population growth encompassing the immediate precontact and contact eras. Special attention is paid to the continuing albeit reduced impact of infanticide. Brief comparisons with other Melanesian and Third World societies are presented; the Asmat average annual growth rate of 1.5% since first permanent contact in 1953 contrasts with the generally higher rates reported for most of these other groups.'

'People\xe2\x80\x99s livelihoods in tropical small-island developing states are greatly dependent on marine ecosystem services. Yet services such as fisheries and coastal buffering are being degraded at an alarming rate, thus making people increasing vulnerable to protracted and sudden environmental changes. In the context of the occurrences of extreme events such as earthquakes and tsunamis, it is vital to uncover the processes that make people in these island states resilient, or not, to environmental disruptions. This paper compares people\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of social and environmental impacts after an extreme event in the Western Solomon Islands (11 different villages on 8 different islands) to better understand how knowledge systems influence the coupling of human and natural systems. We examine the factors that contributed to perceptions of respective recovery in the environmental versus the social domains across communities with different traditional governance and modernization characteristics in a tsunami impact gradient. First, we separately assessed, at the community and individual level, the potential determinants of perceived recovery in the environmental and social domains. At the community level, the average values of the perceived environmental and social recovery were calculated for each community (1\xc2\xa0year after the tsunami), and at the individual level, normally distributed environmental and social recovery variables (based on the difference in perceptions immediately and 1\xc2\xa0year after the tsunami) were used as dependent variables in two General Linear Models. Results suggest that environmental and social resilience are not always coupled correspondingly and, less unexpectedly, that asymmetries during recovery can occur as a result of the underlying social and ecological context and existing adaptive capacity. More generally, the study shows how by evaluating post-disturbance perceptional data in tsunami-affected communities, we can better understand how subjective perceptions of change can affect the (de)-coupling of human and natural systems.'

'The supercontinental status of the contemporary aggregation of continents called North Pangea is substantiated. This supercontinent comprises all continents with the probable exception of Antarctica. In addition to the spatial contiguity of continents, the supercontinent is characterized by the prevalence of the continental crust that combines North America and Eurasia, Eurasia and Africa, and Eurasia and Australia. Over the course of the 300\xe2\x80\x93250-Ma evolution from Wegener\xe2\x80\x99s Pangea to contemporary North Pangea, the aggregation of continents has not lost its supercontinental status, despite modification of the supercontinent shape and opening and closure of the newly formed Paleotethys, Tethys, Atlantic, and Indian oceans. Over the last 250\xe2\x80\x93300 Ma, all movements of the lithospheric plates have most likely occurred within the Indo-Atlantic segment of the Earth, whereas the Pacific segment has remained oceanic. In short, the formation of the North Pangea supercontinent can be outlined in the following terms. The long and deep subduction of the lithospheric plates beneath Eurasia and North America gave rise to the stabilization of the continents and accumulation of huge bodies of the cold lithosphere commensurable in volume with the upper mantle at the deeper mantle levels. This brought about compensation ascent of hot mantle (mantle plumes) near the convergent plate boundaries and far from them. A special geodynamic setting develops beneath the supercontinent. Due to encircling subduction of the lithospheric plates and related squeezing of the hot mantle, an ascending flow, or plume (superplume) formed beneath the central part of the supercontinent. In our view, the African superplume broke up Wegener\xe2\x80\x99s Pangea in the Atlantic region, caused the opening of the Atlantic and Indian oceans, and migrated to the Arctic Region 53 Ma ago.'

'It has been clearly established that the Portuguese introduced coconuts to the Cape Verde islands in 1499, and these supplied the Atlantic coasts and the Caribbean in the 1500s. By contrast, early 16th century reports of coconuts on the Pacific coast of Panama are controversial. Recent DNA analysis of modern coconut populations there shows them to be similar to Philippine varieties, agreeing with morphometric analysis. Hence, coconuts must have been brought by boat from the western Pacific, but no archaeological, ethnobotanical or linguistic evidence for pre-Columbian coconuts has been found. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation is that coconuts were introduced to Panama after Spanish conquest, as supported by DNA analysis and historical records of Spanish voyages. New collections along the Pacific coast, from Mexico to Colombia, are increasing the sampling for genetic analysis, and further work in the Philippines is suggested to test probable origins. Unless new archaeological discoveries prove otherwise, the strong hypothesis of Philippine origin should direct future research on the sources of American Pacific coast coconuts.'

'Active spreading ridges in the North Fiji Basin range from well-developed stable ridges where largescale mantle upwelling is in progress to proto-ridges where spreading is incipient. South of 17\xc2\xb0S, where the central ridge of the North Fiji Basin has a bathymetric profile normally expected of a fast-spreading, steadystate mid-ocean ridge, basalts are evolved N-type MORBs. North of 17\xc2\xb0S, where the central ridge is propagating northward into old North Fiji Basin crust and spreading is in the initial stages, two types of basalt have been recovered: N-type MORBs from this northern arm of the central ridge are believed to be samples of older North Fiji Basin crust; basalts with transitional alkalic chemistry (up to 0.5% Ne in the Norm) and characterized by strong relative enrichments in Rb, Ba, K, Nb, La, Ce, Sr, P, Zr, and Ti are believed to be associated with incipient rifting. Among the latter group are compositions that are intermediate between transitional alkalic types and MORBs and these are geochemically similar to the back-arc basin (BABB) magma type defined by Sinton and Fryer (1987) from a study of Mariana back arc basin basalts. Dredges along the South Pandora Ridge, a transform zone characterized by short spreading segments, are dominated by basalts that are enriched in large-ion lithophile and high field strength minor and trace elements and compositions range from types resembling ocean island tholeiites to transitional alkalic varieties. Basalts from Rotuma are regarded as alkalic end-members of the South Pandora Ridge magmatic spectrum. In areas of the North Fiji Basin where relatively fast spreading must be accompanied by largescale asthenospheric upwelling, depleted (N-type) MORBs dominate, whereas in areas of slow mantle upwelling, or where some other tectonic effect (e.g. a transform fault) causes a transient thermal disturbance within the lithosphere or upper asthenosphere, enriched (alkalic) magmas either dominate or make a significant and noticeable contribution to the overall chemical characteristics of basalts being erupted. The MORBs have a depleted asthenospheric source, and the alkalic component is believed to derive from an enriched lithospheric or shallow asthenospheric source. The BABB magma type may simply be part of the spectrum of mixed magmas that can occur in the transitional tectonic settings represented by the early development of most back-arc basins.'

'Tridacna gigas (L.) populations were sampled from 13 locations throughout the west Pacific in 1990\xe2\x80\x931991 and screened for allozyme variation at seven polymorphic loci. Significant genetic differences were found between the few large stocks of T. gigas remaining in the world. Cluster analysis identified two major regional groups of populations: a \xe2\x80\x9cCentral Pacific\xe2\x80\x9d group consisting of Kiribati and the Marshall Islands, and a \xe2\x80\x9cWest Pacific\xe2\x80\x9d group comprising all other populations. Within the latter group, the Great Barrier Reef populations were significantly differentiated from those in the Solomon Islands. The main routes of gene flow did not run parallel with known major surface currents as might be expected, but crossed them. Gene exchange was limited east-west between the Central and West Pacific groups and the GBR and the Solomon Islands. The lack of correspondence between the major surface currents and the routes of gene flow suggests that the genetic structure of T. gigas reflects historical patterns of migration that no longer occur, rather than presentday dispersal. These findings raise fundamental questions concerning the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity in Pacific faunas, and have important implications for the mariculture and conservation of T. gigas.'

'We investigated long-term zonal flow (U) oscillations in the deep layer in the western Pacific Ocean by comparing measurements obtained from deep mooring observations near the equator with a high-resolution model. For the comparison, we used mooring data at 2,000\xc2\xa0m and below north and south of the equator obtained from preceding studies. In our model results, vertically propagating equatorial annual Rossby waves were detected in the velocity and pressure anomaly (P a) fields. P a had a multi-cell meridional structure symmetric about the equator. The corresponding meridional distribution of U, averaged along the wave propagation, was the same as that previously obtained from Argo float data, suggesting the existence of the multi-cell structure in P a in the real ocean. A harmonic analysis of the simulated U indicated that the equatorial annual Rossby waves excited over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific propagated down to below 2,000\xc2\xa0m in the western equatorial Pacific. Decomposition of the annual U harmonics indicated that the multi-cell structure in pressure was not a manifestation of a single meridional mode but a composite of several lowest meridional modes, suggesting that the cell widths may change according to relative mode intensities. The mooring data north and south of the equator was consistent with the simulated multi-cell structure in P a of the equatorial Rossby waves, although some discrepancies remained. We consider that the observed variation in U is a manifestation of the Rossby wave propagation in the real ocean. The present study is the first to recognize the existence of equatorial annual Rossby waves below 2,000\xc2\xa0m in the western Pacific Ocean from direct current observations.'

'The paper presents the main results of almost half-century-long theoretical and applied studies by the late K.P. Karavanov dedicated to hydrogeological systems of continents and the oceanic floor as well as to the regional hydrogeology of the Pacific segment of the Earth. This research is not yet over; it is being developed by his followers and serves as a basis for the further study of the subsurface hydrosphere on land and the sea and ocean floor.'

'The Indo-Pacific, constructed either as a region, super-region or non-region, is currently a hotly contested map-making phenomenon. Various countries and cultures, washed by the waters of these amorphous oceanic boundaries and sea spaces, are currently seeking to establish exclusive territorial claims over these water spaces by invoking stories and narratives taken from pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. These stories are often used in an attempt to legitimate \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d, and more essentialist relationships between certain cultures and/or nation-states with their surrounding seas. These narratives both challenge the broader international system and its rule of law, and create internal narratives, strengthening domestic and national support for state-building programs in the region/s. But the Indo-Pacific is more than a contestation between nation-statist imaginations and aspirations. It also invokes stories which seek to develop and celebrate a shared \xe2\x80\x9cmaritime regionalism\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the exclusive and usually dominant politics of nation-states. Finally, a third interpretive category is used: the construction of the Indo-Pacific as a globalised \xe2\x80\x9cnon-space\xe2\x80\x9d.'

'Social integration of the elderly is a key analytical concept in both Western social and cross-cultural gerontology. While generally understood to describe the fit between the elderly and society in industrial nations, this construct should have utility for Third World societies as well. I argue that the concept is useful insofar as we clarify several antecedent considerations. These are, specification of (1) the model of integration being used; (2) other social distinctions besides age which affect the elderly; (3) the analytical level used; (4) underlying values leading to or away from integration; and, (5) the referent moment of time for society. These notions are discussed with reference to old age in one small-scale Melanesian society, Malo, Vanuatu.'

'Climate-related disasters such as tropical cyclones, floods and droughts are not new to Pacific Islanders, who have developed customary or \xe2\x80\x98traditional\xe2\x80\x99 practices to enable communities to adapt and recover from such hazards. Some of these practices have been degraded and some assisted by modernisation. Through their effects on the island environment, these hazards have a range of socio-economic impacts on food (fisheries and crops) and water supply, tourism, and coastal buildings and infrastructure. The varied impacts of climate change not only exacerbate those hazards but also raise new threats, such as sea level rise and ocean acidification, that have no precedent in the past 500\xc2\xa0years, and for which there are therefore no traditional adaptations, although Pacific innate ingenuity and resilience remains strong. These issues are particularly acute for the low-lying atoll countries whose continued existence is threatened by sea level rise, but also affect those that live on higher islands in coastal settlements, where most of their population is concentrated. Climate change thus sharpens social and cultural issues of equity (reflecting disparities in location, income, education, gender, health and age), made even more acute by increased levels of voluntary or forced migration within, and even more so beyond, island country boundaries. Consequently, many islanders see climate change as a moral challenge to the richer countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the problem.'

"Ernst Mayr's scientific career continues strongly 70 years after he published his first scientific paper in 1923. He is primarily a naturalist and ornithologist which has influenced his basic approach in science and later in philosophy and history of science. Mayr studied at the Natural History Museum in Berlin with Professor E. Stresemann, a leader in the most progressive school of avian systematics of the time. The contracts gained through Stresemann were central to Mayr's participation in a three year expedition to New Guinea and The Solomons, and the offer of a position in the Department of Ornithology, American Museum of Natural History, beginning in 1931. At the AMNH, Mayr was able to blend the best of the academic traditions of Europe with those of North America in developing a unified research program in biodiversity embracing systematics, biogeography and nomenclature. His tasks at the AMNH were to curate and study the huge collections amassed by the Whitney South Sea Expedition plus the just purchased Rothschild collection of birds. These studies provided Mayr with the empirical foundation essential for his 1942Systematics and the Origin of Species and his subsequent theoretical work in evolutionary biology as well as all his later work in the philosophy and history of science. Without a detailed understanding of Mayr's empirical systematic and biogeographic work, one cannot possibly comprehend fully his immense contributions to evolutionary biology and his later analyses in the philosophy and history of science."

'The PRC and Taiwan are competing to gain diplomatic recognition from Pacific Islands states, a number of which recognise Taiwan and serve as a barrier to its international isolation.

This paper focuses on the intensifying conflict\xe2\x80\x93with conclusions about the local political economic situations of the countries in Oceania that are most likely to switch recognition, the dilemmas that the issue poses for Australia and its alliance with the US, and the game theory of these auctions of diplomatic recognition.

'This paper seeks to critically evaluate part of the New Caledonian independence debate, as discursively enacted by various social actors within the postcolonial space. It is common within Critical Discourse Analysis to investigate texts from the dominant side only and as a monologue in order to elucidate covert power processes. However, this case study simultaneously explores the counter-discourse of resistance, thus offering a more balanced insight in the ongoing conflict situation. A Pragma-Functional approach, combining Systemic Functional Linguistics and Pragma-Dialectics is applied to a set of data across various genres and registers, investigating salient patterns in the discourse samples, produced by various representatives of relevant speech communities. The study demonstrates how the interactants in the New Caledonian independence debate construe power and ideology through the transitivity choices and enthymematic structures they employ, revealing highly incongruous views and assumptions of the reality of \xe2\x80\x98Caledonianness\xe2\x80\x99. It further argues that the dominant French discourse aims to convince the New Caledonian audience of the truth of their propositions by presenting their view as a common sense solution to the independence issue, whereas the opposing side actively contests this view and, instead, wishes to promote the \xe2\x80\x98Melanesian way\xe2\x80\x99.'

'Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major public health problem in the Pacific. As the global prevalence of infection was not known in New Caledonia (NC), a serosurvey study was conducted by determining the prevalence of circulating filarial antigens, as recommended by the World Health Organization.'

'We have determined the various haplotypic combinations between alleles as well as restriction fragment length polymorphisms of two linked genetic markers, albumin and vitamin D-binding protein or group-specific component, in a number of Asian-Pacific populations. Using the partial maximum likelihood method, we constructed a phylogenetic network from the haplotype frequencies to assess relationships among the populations sampled. No systematic linkage disequilibrium was detected between most of the combinations, suggesting a lack of operation of any selection pressure at the two loci. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed the known interrelationships among various populations in the Asian-Pacific region. The Australian aborigines clustered closely with the non-Austronesian-speaking highlanders from Papua New Guinea, as expected. Similarly, the Austronesian-speaking Polynesians, Micronesians, and the Southeast Asians branched off together as a separate group. The position of the Austronesian-speaking Tolais from New Britain with respect to other populations from the Southwest Pacific was anomalous. The Tolais revealed a strong affinity with the Australian aborigines, which is inexplicable. The populations from China formed a tight cluster with other populations from the Asian-Pacific region. Genetic interrelationships of these populations with the white Australians were remote, which is in accordance with the known affinities of various human racial groups.'

'Since the discovery in 1966 of the Gm ab3st gene, which characterizes Mongoloid populations, the distribution of allotypes of immunoglobulins (Gm) among Mongoloid populations scattered from Southeast Asia through East Asia to South America has been investigated, and the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. Mongoloid populations can be characterized by four Gm haplotypes, Gm ag, axg, ab3st, and afb1b3, and can be divided into two groups based on the analysis of genetic distances utilizing Gm haplotype frequency distributions: the first is a southern group characterized by a remarkably high frequency of Gm afb1b3 and a low frequency of Gm ag, and the second, a northern group characterized by a high frequency of both Gm ag and Gm ab3st but an extremely low frequency of Gm afb1b3. 2. Populations in China, mainly Han but including minority nationalities, show remarkable heterogeneity of Gm allotypes from north to south and contrast sharply to Korean and Japanese populations, which are considerably more homogenous with respect to these genetic markers. The center of dispersion of the Gm afb1b3 gene characterizing southern Mongoloids has been identified as the Guangxi and Yunnan area in the southwest of China. 3. The Gm ab3st gene, which is found with its the highest incidence among the northern Baikal Buriats, flows in all directions. However, this gene shows a precipitous drop from mainland China to Taiwan and Southeast Asia and from North to South America, although it is still found in high frequency among Eskimos, Koryaks, Yakuts, Tibetans, Olunchuns, Tungus, Koreans, Japanese, and Ainus. On the other hand, the gene was introduced into Huis, Uyghurs, Indians, Iranians, and spread as far as to include Hungarians and Sardinians in Italy. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that the Japanese race belongs to northern Mongoloids and that the origin of the Japanese race was in Siberia, and most likely in the Baikal area of the Soviet Union.'

'In this work, the vertical structure and variability along the western boundary of the Philippines are investigated using direct observations from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), Doppler volume sampler (DVS) and Aanderaa Seaguard instruments, which are mounted on a subsurface mooring deployed at 8\xc2\xb0N, 127\xc2\xb03\xe2\x80\xb2E. In climatology, the southward Mindanao Current (MC) and northward Mindanao Undercurrent (MUC) play a dominant role in the upper layer. The mean currents at 1200 and 3500\xc2\xa0m flow northward, whereas those at 2500 and 5600\xc2\xa0m flow equatorward. The power spectral density (PSD) shows that an intraseasonal signal of 60\xe2\x80\x9380\xc2\xa0days is common from the sea surface to the bottom. The semiannual signals are strongest in the MUC layer, and the amplitude then decreases with depth to 3500\xc2\xa0m. The seasonal variability at 2500 and 5600\xc2\xa0m is similar between the two depths, suggesting a southward current in winter and northward flow in autumn. The current at 3500\xc2\xa0m exhibits a northward direction in spring and southward flow in winter. In addition, the linear correlations between mooring data and altimetry products indicate that the variations in surface meridional currents along the western boundary of the Pacific Ocean can reach the bottom via low-frequency processes. The vertical-mode decomposition for observations indicates that the first four modes can effectively capture the original data. The relative contributions of different modes exhibit seasonal variability. The first baroclinic mode plays a dominant role in spring and autumn. In winter and summer, its contribution decreases and becomes comparable to that of the other modes.'

'The World fauna of the tribe Eupitheciini is the most species-rich in the family Geometridae. This tribe includes about 1900 species (almost 3000 species-group names) from 47 genera; about one third of the genera (15) are monotypic. The generic diversity of Eupitheciini is the highest in the Australian (38 genera, 11 of them endemic) and Oriental regions (32 genera, 4 endemic) and the lowest in the Neotropical Region (possibly one genus only). The faunas of different biogeographic regions can be arranged in following order by their species richness: the Palaearctic (487 species), Oriental (397), Neotropical (346), Australian (251), Afrotropical (198), and Nearctic Regions (166 species). Eupithecia is the most species-rich genus in the family Geometridae and the entire order Lepidoptera, and one of the largest genera in the whole World fauna of insects. The greatest number of species of this genus is recorded in the Palaearctic Region (466 species), where Eupithecia accounts for about 95% of the tribe Eupitheciini. The mainland of the Oriental Region (especially the Himalayas) is also very species-rich; however the proportion of the Eupithecia representatives decreases towards Malaysia, Sundaland, and the Australian Region (about 2% of the tribe). The Eupitheciini faunas have the greatest similarity at the generic level between the Oriental and Australian Regions (the Jaccard and S\xc3\xb8rensen coefficient values being 0.62 and 0.77, respectively). The Palaearctic fauna is more similar to the Afrotropical and Oriental faunas at the genus-group level. On the whole, the fauna of the Nearctic Region is similar to that the West Palaearctic, with the exception of the fact that representatives of the genera Gymnoscelis and Chloroclystis are absent in North America, although two endemic genera Nasusina and Prorella are present. At the genus-group level, the Nearctic fauna of Eupitheciini is more similar to the Neotropical (the Jaccard and S\xc3\xb8rensen coefficients 0.20 and 0.33, respectively) than to the Palaearctic fauna (0.17 and 0.29). The number of synonymies is very high in the tribe Eupitheciini because of the homogeneity of this group, whose species are difficult to identify without the use of elaborate anatomical techniques. Modern revisions, catalogues, surveys, and atlases on Eupitheciini are absent for many countries and large geographic regions. Revisions of pugs of the tribe Eupitheciini for some biogeographic regions are extremely difficult because of fragmentation of entomological collections including the type specimens of many species-group taxa. A large fraction of synonyms is characteristic of parts of the World with the best known faunas: Europe (64% of synonyms) and North America (39%). On the contrary, the lowest levels of synonymy are typical of the less known faunas of the regions situated at the equatorial latitudes, namely the Neotropical (9%) and Afrotropical (8%) ones.'

'Bamus and Ulawun are more than 400 m higher than all other major composite volcanoes in the 1000-km-long Bismarck volcanic arc. The two cones are immediately adjacent to each other and have partly coalesced. This close proximity, their similarity of form, and their positions over the same depths (70\xe2\x80\x93160 km) to the New Britain Benioff zone, could be indications that Bamus and Ulawun have had related, or at least similar, eruptive histories. But there are important differences between the two volcanoes. Bamus is thought to have last erupted some time between 1878 and 1894, whereas Ulawun has erupted at least 17 times since the late nineteenth century. In addition, the rocks of Bamus are distinctly different from those of Ulawun. Mafic rocks are found in the older part of Bamus (including a boninite-like, or magnesian-andesite, lava flow), and the younger rocks of Bamus are low-MgO andesites (the most recent products have the highest SiO2 contents of all the analysed rock samples). In contrast, Ulawun appears to be a uniform pile of basalts and some andesites that have consistently lower amounts of CaO and Zr compared to Bamus rocks. Ulawun basalts are unlikely to represent the parental magmas from which Bamus andesites were derived by simple crystal fractionation, judging by the results of least-squares mixing calculations and the relatively high Zr contents of the Bamus andesites. The magmatic histories of Bamus and Ulawun appear to be unrelated, but because both volcanoes are the highest of all volcanoes in the Bismarck volcanic arc, both may now be susceptible to large-scale gravitational slumping or cauldron subsidence. North- and east-trending lineaments and escarpments on both volcanoes may represent the tectonically controlled scars of former gravitational collapses. Ulawun, in particular, may be at a critical stage because of its great height and steep slopes, and because eruptions in 1978 took place from a new, east-trending (possibly tectonically controlled) fissure low on the eastern flank of the volcano.'

'Ernst Mayr (1904\xe2\x80\x93), naturalist and ornithologist since his early youth, is one of the \xe2\x80\x98architects\xe2\x80\x99 of the synthetic theory of evolution of the 1940s. His main contribution was the analysis of the origin of species, i.e. the causes of biodiversity. The historical roots of these ideas reach far back to the early 1920s, when the 19-year-old student suggested to his mentor, Dr. Erwin Stresemann (Berlin), the development for birds of a \xe2\x80\x9ctheory of geographical variation and of the species.\xe2\x80\x9d During the 1930s, Mayr himself assembled data for a comprehensive analysis of geographical variation and speciation in birds, when he studied the rich collections of the Whitney South Sea Expedition from the islands in the Pacific Ocean. He described from this and other regions 27 new species and 445 new subspecies of birds, more than any other living ornithologist. He established the basic principles of island biogeography, discussed critically the former existence of landbridges and emphasized that, in zoogeographical studies, \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of fixed regions, it is necessary to think of fluid faunas.\xe2\x80\x9d His theoretical framework included active jump dispersal of birds and other animals as well as various types of vicariance processes which had an effect on faunal differentiation. Although Mayr was not the originator of the biological species concept, he demonstrated its validity more convincingly than anyone else before and proposed a superior and concise definition of the biospecies which everybody adopted. He also initiated with various studies a period of renewed interest in the macrosystematics of birds.'

'During the Early Cretaceous, ocean-floor spreading gradually opened up the tropical Atlantic and the Indian Ocean basin widened as the eastern segments of Gondwanaland were conveyed farther apart. At the same time, epeiric seas were advancing on all continents, reaching maximum extent during the Cenomanian. The resultant trend to widespread, more equable climate favored the invasion into the lowlands of angiosperms whose postulated origin was in mild uplands at low latitudes during pre-Cretaceous times. As tropical and subtropical lands were rafted farther apart by ocean-floor spreading following Albian-Cenomanian times, new taxa (species, genera, tribes, families) evolved in isolation. This accounts in part for the increasing richness of the three major tropical floras following the Cretaceous. Changes in Mesozoic paleogeography also appear to clarify several other puzzling aspects of early angiosperm history and distribution, including their early appearance at middle latitudes.'

'During the last three years, the North Fiji Basin (SW Pacific) has been intensively studied on three oceanographic cruises carried out by French, American and Japanese ships. One of the main goals of these cruises was to study by means of precise SeaBeam, SEAMARC II, seismic and magnetic surveys, the active spreading system and its associated hydrothermal processes. The North Fiji basin, bounded by the major Pacific and Indo-Australian plates, shows a complex polyphased tectonic evolution. One of the last phases of this evolution is the functioning since 3 Ma of a NS spreading center in the axial part of the basin. The tectonic instability of the area resulted in a permanent rearrangement of the ridge axis. Among others, the 16\xc2\xb040\xe2\x80\xb2 S triple junction is one of the major manifestations of such an instability. Sinistral strike-slip motion 1 Ma ago, along the North Fiji Fracture Zone induced the change in direction of two segments of the axis from NS to N15 and N160. The first segment is characterized by a typical spreading ridge similar to various parts of the EPR, while the second shows an atypical \xe2\x80\x98en echelon\xe2\x80\x99 fan-shape opening. The N15 and N160 ridges converging with the North Fiji Fracture Zone constitute the 16\xc2\xb040\xe2\x80\xb2 S Ridge-Ridge-Fracture Zone triple junction. The detailed morphologic and kinematic study of this junction allows us to understand one of the mechanisms of the deformation in the North Fiji basin.'

"Phylogenetic analyses of the Annonaceae consistently identify four clades: a basal clade consisting of Anaxagorea, and a small 'ambavioid' clade that is sister to two main clades, the 'long branch clade' (LBC) and 'short branch clade' (SBC). Divergence times in the family have previously been estimated using non-parametric rate smoothing (NPRS) and penalized likelihood (PL). Here we use an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLD) relaxed molecular clock in BEAST to estimate diversification times of the main clades within the family with a focus on the Asian genus Pseuduvaria within the SBC. Two fossil calibration points are applied, including the first use of the recently discovered Annonaceae fossil Futabanthus. The taxonomy and morphology of Pseuduvaria have been well documented, although no previous dating or biogeographical studies have been undertaken. Ancestral areas at internal nodes within Pseuduvaria are determined using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and weighted ancestral area analysis (WAAA)."

'The genusFagraea comprises a diverse group of woody gentians that are renowned for having hard wood and fragrant, showy flowers. This diverse assemblage of approximately 70 species is distributed from Southeast Asia, Malesia, to the archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean.Fagraea species occupy important niches in forest ecosystems. These fast growing, pioneer species are an important component in natural succession after forest disturbance and provide food and shelter for many other forest species. The plants have played an important role in the lives of humans and have made their way into the legends of Polynesia.Fagraea plants are utilized by the Asian, Australian, Malesian, Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian cultures for timber, weapons, crafts, medicine, and adornment. This paper is a comprehensive survey of the past and present uses of the species by these cultures and identifies the need for future scientific research onFagraea.'

'This paper investigates how coastal mobility and a community\xe2\x80\x99s place within regional trade networks intersect with technological organisation. To do this, we identified different types of lithic production and exchange during the late pre-colonial period at three coastal sites around Madang in northeast New Guinea. The study is the first major technological and sourcing study in this area. Consistent with terrestrial models, lithic technological analysis crucially shows that groups with higher levels of coastal mobility (1) were reducing a wider range of lithic materials and (2) reduced material less intensively than groups with indirect access. Conversely, groups with lower coastal mobility levels (1) were flaking a restricted range of lithic materials and (2) reduced material more intensively. Geochemical analysis, using X-ray fluorescence, shows that at all three sites obsidian artefacts exclusively derived from Kutau/Bao (Talasea) in West New Britain. This indicates that, by about 600\xc2\xa0years ago through to the late nineteenth century, the Kutau/Bao source had become a specialised export product, being fed into major distribution conduits operational along the northeast coast. Importantly, there is no evidence for exchange with other sources such as Admiralties or Fergusson Island obsidian. This is contrastive to the Sepik coast, where obsidian from the Admiralties Islands featured prominently alongside West New Britain obsidian, and suggests the emergence of different coastal supply lines feeding the northeast Madang coast and the north Sepik coast.'

'This paper discusses the origins of Oryza sativa japonica rice cultivation in the Yangzi region of China and asks how and with which migrating human populations it spread south to reach Taiwan by 3,000 BC and Southeast Asia by 2,000 BC. The perspective adopted is that the spread of rice was driven mainly by demographic expansion, associated with a spread of languages and archaeological material culture. Environmental barriers also played major roles in establishing a \xe2\x80\x9cpause, adapt, spread, pause again\xe2\x80\x9d mode of movement, such barriers relating to availability of rainfall and alluvial land, latitude (photoperiodism) and climatic seasonality, and the prior presences of other populations, in some cases with vegetative gardening systems that did not involve rice or other cereals. Contingency also played its part in rice history, as we can see with the inability of this crop to spread into Oceania in part due to the route followed by Neolithic colonizers.'

'The volcanic rocks along the south-eastern and eastern Tyrrhenian border of Italy have been classified as converging plate margin magma types by using discriminant functions based on major element patterns. These rocks belong to calc-alkaline and shoshonitic associations (shoshonites, and predominant leucitic rocks) ranging in age from Upper Miocene to, mostly, Quaternary.'

'Blood samples from a series of Dani speaking persons from Pit River, West Irian have been studied for genetic variants in 14 red cell enzyme and 5 serum protein systems. Four of the red cell enzyme systems were polymorphic: acid phosphatase, 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, adenosine deaminase and phosphoglucomutase (locus 1). Two of the serum protein systems, haptoglobin and transferrin, were polymorphic. In the other systems three MDH \xe2\x80\x9cNew Guinea-1\xe2\x80\x9d variants were detected and two persons with variants, one MS and one SS, in the protease inhibitor system were detected also. An unusual variant in the PGM (locus 2) system has not yet been adequately identified. All other systems were monomorphic.'

'Three main groups of lavas are exposed on islands of the Lau Ridge: the Lau Volcanic Group (LVG), 14.0\xe2\x80\x935.4 Ma, are predominantly andesite; Korobasaga Volcanic Group (KVG), 4.4\xe2\x80\x932.4 Ma, are predominantly basalt and Mago Volcanic Group (MVG), 2.0\xe2\x80\x930.3 Ma, are basalt-hawaiite. LVG and KVG lavas are mostly medium-K tholeiitic rocks with high LILE/HFSE ratios characteristic of islands ares, while MVG lavas are ne-normative alkalic rocks with high LILE and HFSE, characteristic of ocean island basalts. LVG lavas have high \xc9\x9bNd (+8.0\xe2\x80\x93+8.4) and low 87Sr/86Sr (0.70273\xe2\x80\x930.70349) similar to N-MORB, whereas KVG lavas have slightly more radiogenic values (\xc9\x9bNd=+7.5\xe2\x88\x92+8.4; 87Sr/86Sr=0.70323-0.70397). MVG lavas form an isotopically distinct group having lower \xc9\x9bNd (+4.6\xe2\x80\x93+4.9) and (87Sr/86Sr ranging from 0.70347\xe2\x80\x930.70375). LVG lavas were erupted in a primary oceanic island arc (Vitiaz arc) during the Miocene. Basaltic lavas were derived by approximately 19% partial melting of mantle wedge peridotite with only minor subduction component. Andesites and dacites were produced by low-pressure plagioclase-pyroxene-titanomagnetite dominated crystal fractionation. KVG lavas were erupted during the period immediately prior to or during the initial stages of rifting in the Lau Basin, and, like LVG lavas, show significant chemical differences at the northern and southern ends of the Lau Ridge. Lavas at the northern end (type (ii)) appear to be derived from a more depleted source than LVG but with a greater amount of subduction component. Those at the southern end (type (i)) probably came from a slightly more enriched source with less subduction component. MVG basalts and hawaiites were derived from an enriched mantle with little or no subduction input. The hawaiites (type (i)) could not have been derived from the basalts (type (ii)), and the two magma types must have come from different sources, indicating mantle heterogeneity. The lack of subduction influence indicates the MVG lavas are tectonically unrelated to the present-day Tonga arc, and the lack of depletion indicators suggests they have tapped a different (new?) part of the mantle wedge. This may reflect introduction of sub-Pacific mantle through the present Tonga-Lau subduction system.'

'There has been a long-standing debate concerning the extent to which the spread of Neolithic ceramics and Malay-Polynesian languages in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) were coupled to an agriculturally driven demic dispersal out of Taiwan 4000\xc2\xa0years ago (4\xc2\xa0ka). We previously addressed this question using founder analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region sequences to identify major lineage clusters most likely to have dispersed from Taiwan into ISEA, proposing that the dispersal had a relatively minor impact on the extant genetic structure of ISEA, and that the role of agriculture in the expansion of the Austronesian languages was therefore likely to have been correspondingly minor. Here we test these conclusions by sequencing whole mtDNAs from across Taiwan and ISEA, using their higher chronological precision to resolve the overall proportion that participated in the \xe2\x80\x9cout-of-Taiwan\xe2\x80\x9d mid-Holocene dispersal as opposed to earlier, postglacial expansions in the Early Holocene. We show that, in total, about 20\xc2\xa0% of mtDNA lineages in the modern ISEA pool result from the \xe2\x80\x9cout-of-Taiwan\xe2\x80\x9d dispersal, with most of the remainder signifying earlier processes, mainly due to sea-level rises after the Last Glacial Maximum. Notably, we show that every one of these founder clusters previously entered Taiwan from China, 6\xe2\x80\x937\xc2\xa0ka, where rice-farming originated, and remained distinct from the indigenous Taiwanese population until after the subsequent dispersal into ISEA.'

'In 1925, J.D. Tothill and two colleagues set out to manage Levuana iridescens, the coconut moth of Fiji, using biological control. By 1930, they had succeeded so completely that this pest of the copra crop had been reduced to almost undetectable levels by the tachinid fly, Bessa remota, introduced from Malaya, and they had summarized their campaign in a thoroughly documented and well-illustrated monograph. The example of the coconut moth is presented in the modern literature as the first and best documented extinction of a species due to scientific biological control. The program has been severely criticized because the moth was unique, beautiful, and considered endemic to Fiji. Thus, this program is also portrayed as an example of the highly controversial practice of neoclassical biological control. However, a careful reexamination of this event discloses that the moth was likely not native to Fiji, appeared to be spreading through the Fijian Archipelago, and might have spread to other island groups in the South Pacific. Also, L. iridescens is probably not extinct. Collateral damage, that is, non-target impacts, did occur as native zygaenid moths have been attacked by the tachinid, and they may be extinct. The reasons for the control campaign of L. iridescens were not primarily economic. Tothill and colleagues were trying to protect copra so that ethnic Fijian culture, so dependent on the coconut palm threatened by L. iridescens, could be sustained. Hence, this control program represents a difficult clash of values: preservation of insect biodiversity versus preservation of indigenous Pacific Islander cultures. A strategy to search for L. iridescens populations is proposed and development of biological control of B. remota, using hyperparasitoids, is possible, but would require careful evaluation since it might release L. iridescens from suppression, have non-target impacts on native tachinids, and lack an economic motivation.'

'The manufacture of edible starch products from sago palms of the genus Metroxylon is common to indigenous people throughout Melanesia but is unknown in Polynesia, even in areas where Metroxylon species occur. We here report the use of Metroxylon as a starch source in the isolated Polynesian island of Rotuma. In Rotuma, Metroxylon warburgii (Heim) Beccari grows wild, but is likely the result of an aboriginal introduction from Melanesia. Samoan ethnohistorical accounts indicate that Metroxylon warburgii was introduced to Samoa from Rotuma. Rotuman manufacture of starch from M. warburgii appears to date from pre-European times as indicated by written accounts of early visitors to Rotuma and Rotuman oral histories. We provide details of the process of starch manufacture in Rotuma and speculate on possible means by which this technology was transferred from Melanesia to Rotuma.'

'The main differences and similarities between the tectonic features of the Urals and the Tien Shan are considered. In the Neoproterozoic and Early and Middle Paleozoic, the Ural and Turkestan oceanic basins were parts of one oceanic domain, with several distinct regions in which tectonic events took different courses. The Baltic continental margin of the Ural paleoocean was active, whereas the Tarim-Alay margin of the Turkestan ocean, similar in position, was passive. The opposite continental margin in the Urals is known beginning from the Devonian as the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent. In the Tien Shan, a similar margin developed until the Late Ordovician as the Syr Darya block with the ancient continental crust. In the Silurian, this block became a part of the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent. The internal structures of the Ural and Turkestan paleooceans were different. The East Ural microcontinent occurred in the Ural paleoocean during the Early and Middle Paleozoic. No microcontinents are established in the Turkestan oceanic basin. Volcanic arcs in the Ural paleoocean were formed in the Vendian (Ediacarian), at the Ordovician-Silurian boundary, and in the Devonian largely along the Baltic margin at different distances from its edge. In the Turkestan paleoocean, a volcanic arc probably existed in the Ordovician at its Syr Darya margin, i.e., on the other side of the ocean in comparison with the Urals. The subduction of the Turkestan oceanic crust developed with interruptions always in the same direction. The evolution of subduction in the Urals was more complicated. The island arc-continent collision occurred here in the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous; the continent-continent collision took place in the Moscovian simultaneously with the same process in the Tien Shan. The deepwater flysch basins induced by collision appeared at the Baltic margin in the Famennian and Visean, whereas in the Bashkirian and Moscovian they appeared at the Alay-Tarim margin. In the Devonian and Early Carboniferous, the Ural and Turkestan paleooceans had a common active margin along the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent. The sudduction of the oceanic crust beneath this paleocontinent in both the Urals and the Tien Shan started, recommenced after interruptions, and finally ceased synchronously. In the South Ural segment, the Early Carboniferous subduction developed beneath both Baltica and the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent, whereas in the Tien Shan, it occurred only beneath the latter paleocontinent. A divergent nappe-fold orogen was formed in the Urals as a result of collision of the Kazakh-Kyrgyz paleocontinent with the Baltic and Alay-Tarim paleocontinents, whereas a unilateral nappe-fold orogen arose in the Tien Shan. The growth of the high divergent orogen brought about the appearance of the Ural Foredeep filled with molasse beginning from the Kungurian. In the Tien Shan, a similar foredeep was not developed; a granitic axis similar to the main granitic axis in the Urals was not formed in the Tien Shan either.'

'Extralimital traits\xe2\x80\x94evolutionary innovations that represent unprecedented departures from the phenotypic norm in the clade in which they arise\xe2\x80\x94are often thought preferentially to evolve in island-like settings, but accumulating evidence indicates that they also arise in highly diverse, competitively rigorous ecosystems. In order to evaluate the origins of extralimital traits, I reconstructed the history of all ecological and shell-morphological innovations in Miocene to Recent shallow-water molluscs from the two great modern tropical marine realms, the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) and Atlantic-eastern Pacific (AEP), with the expectation that the more diverse IWP would show a higher incidence of innovation. Of the 66 innovations I identified, 53 (80%) are IWP and 13 (20%) are AEP in origin. Data on the numbers of living species in 26 molluscan clades in the two tropical realms indicate that the species ratio (AEP to total number of species 0.32\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.115) exceeds the innovation ratio (AEP to total innovations 0.21). The per-species frequency of innovation is therefore significantly higher in the IWP. None of the innovations is unique to endemic taxa on oceanic islands. I suggest that warm, large, highly productive environments are more conducive to the establishment of new ecological roles and phenotypic states than are smaller, less productive, more island-like settings; and that diversity need not be correlated with either high productivity or evolutionary opportunity for innovation.'

' Grab samples from the submarine Conical Seamount, located about 10\xe2\x80\x89km south of the giant Ladolam gold deposit, Lihir Island, reveal the highest gold concentrations yet reported from the modern seafloor. Lavas from Conical Seamount are characterized by high K2O contents, high K2O/Na2O ratios, and high Ce/Yb ratios, which are typical of high-K igneous rocks from oceanic (island) arc-settings. The primitive character of the rocks from Conical Seamount implies a magmatic evolution related to a single eruptive phase, which contrasts with the more evolved rocks forming Lihir Island. Geochemical as well as mineral chemical data suggest that the melts from both Conical Seamount and Lihir Island originate from the same magma source. In common with the samples from Lihir Island, elevated oxygen fugacities of 0.7\xe2\x80\x932.5\xe2\x80\x89log units above the FMQ buffer are recorded from the Conical Seamount lavas.'

"Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers were used to assess the genetic relatedness between Dioscorea alata and nine other edible Dioscorea. These species include D. abyssinica Hoch., D. bulbifera L., D. cayenensis-rotundata Lamk. et Poir., D. esculenta Burk., D. nummularia Lam., D. pentaphylla L., D. persimilis Prain. et Burk., D. transversa Br. and D. trifida L. Four successive studies were conducted with emphasis on the genetic relationship within D. alata and among species of the Enantiophyllum section from Vanuatu. Study 1 was carried out to select a set of polymorphic primer pairs using 11 combinations and eight species belonging to five distinct sections. The four most polymorphic primer pairs were used in study 2 among six species of the Enantiophyllum section. Study 3 focussed mainly on the genetic relationship among 83 accessions of D. alata, mostly from Vanuatu (78 acc.) but also from Benin, Guadeloupe, New Caledonia and Vietnam. The ploidy level of 53 accessions was determined and results indicated the presence of tetraploid, hexaploid and octoploid cultivars. Study 4, included 35 accessions of D. alata, D. nummularia and D. transversa and was conducted using two primer pairs to verify the taxonomical identity of the cultivars `langlang', `maro' and `netsar' from Vanuatu. The overall results indicated that each accession can be fingerprinted uniquely with AFLP. D. alata is an heterogeneous species which shares a common genetic background with D. nummularia and `langlang', `maro' and `netsar'. UPGMA cluster analysis revealed the existence of three major groups of genotypes within D. alata, each assembling accessions from distant geographical origins and different ploidy levels. The analysis also revealed that `langlang', `maro' and `netsar' clustered together with the cultivar `wael' (D. transversa) from New Caledonia. Results are discussed in the paper."

'Marine shell ornaments have several characteristics that make them significant for archaeological analysis. Made from a raw material valued by cultures throughout the world and imbued with water, life, health, and fertility symbolism, shell objects have functioned as prestige goods. Shell prestige goods circulated between individuals, groups, and societies and materialized interpersonal relationships, making them valuable for archaeologists shifting focus from objects to the people in past societies. Shell ornaments had multiple roles, including ornamentation, wealth, marking status, and as ritual paraphernalia, and had varying symbolic associations even within a society. The rich ethnographic literature on shell use provides a source for archaeological model building. Marine shell artifacts often moved between societies and across long distances, offering a way for archaeologists to explore regional relationships and the interactions between ancient societies. To do this requires using several scales of analysis to investigate archaeological residues of a system that includes marine shell ornaments, the social organization of their production and exchange, and the people who made, displayed, and circulated them.'

'The latest results of anthropological studies of bone remains from the earliest Upper Paleolithic burial discovered on Russian territory, the Markina Gora site (Kostenki 14), are described. Multivariate statistical methods and parallel studies of the buried skull structure and dentition established that their morphological characteristics undoubtedly belonged to the Caucasian complex. In combination with paleogenetic data, the findings contradict the earlier hypothesis of the southern origin of the Kostenki 14 individual and its similarity to the population of the Australo-Melanesian region.'

'On 11 March 2011 a subsea earthquake off the north-eastern coast of Honshu Island, Japan generated a huge tsunami which was felt throughout the Pacific. At the opposite end of the Pacific Ocean, on the south-east coast of Australia, multiple reflections, scatterings and alternate pathways lead to a prolonged and complicated response. This response was largely unaltered in crossing the continental shelf but was then transformed by bay resonances and admittances. These effects are described using data from tide recorders sparsely spread over 1,000\xc2\xa0km of the coast. Some new adaptations and applications of time-series analysis are applied to separate tsunami waves that have followed different pathways but contain the same spectral components. The possible types of harbour response are classified and illustrated. Despite its small height in this region, the tsunami put several swimmers at serious risk and generated strong harbour oscillations, which should be considered when generating future warnings.'

'The first-order Line, Hawaiian, Emperor, Pukapuka, Louisville, Ninetyeast, and Chagos-Lackadive tectonovolcanic ridges in the Pacific and Indian oceans are considered. These ridges are combined into the category of demarcation tectonic units separating the largest morphostructural sectors of the oceans. The ridges extend for thousands kilometers and are a few hundred kilometers in width. Their crest zones are crowned by numerous volcanoes. The volcanic rocks are largely basalts with elevated alkalinity. All of the ridges were formed in the Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic; the ages of particular ridges are variable. The dimensions of the demarcation tectonic units allow us to refer them to the processes proceeding in the mantle, including tectonic flow, faulting, and significant strike-slip displacements.'

'Recent studies show a remarkable scarcity of faunal exchange events between Australia and New Guinea in the Pleistocene despite the presence of a broad land connection for long periods. This is attributed to unfavourable conditions in the connecting area associated with the long established northern Australian Monsoon Climate. This would be expected to have impacted strongly on freshwater faunas with the following results: (1) limited overlap in species, (2) most higher taxonomic groups present in both areas sharing no species or even genera and (3) shared species dominated by lentic species with high dispersal capacity. Testing these predictions for dragonflies showed the turnover in the family, genus and species composition between Australia and New Guinea to be higher than anywhere in the world with only 50% of families and subfamilies, 33% of the genera and 8% of the species being shared. Only one of the 53 shared species favors lotic waters compared with 64% of the 652 combined Australian\xe2\x80\x93New Guinean species. These results agree with our predictions and indicate that the dragonfly fauna of Australia and New Guinea have effectively been separated during the Pleistocene probably due to the prolonged unfavourable climatic conditions in the intervening areas.'

'Recent volcanic activity along the northern flank of the Fiji Platform, revealed for the first time from new GLORIA imagery, suggests that the loci of interplate motion in this region have migrated rapidly since the switch from Vitiaz to New Hebridean subduction at 5\xe2\x80\x938 Ma. At present the plate boundaries along the northern flank of the Fiji Platform consist of two major strike-slip faults of opposing sense: the sinistral Fiji Transform Fault along the northwest flank of the platform, and at least one (or possibly two) zones of dextral strike slip (including Peggy Ridge) along the northeast flank. The tectonic relation-ships of these two fault systems lies north of Fiji and is not determined.'

'A systematic revision of flying fishes of the subgenus Hirundichthys s.str was carried out based on a study of meristic and morphometric traits and characteristics of pigmentation of fishes from the local populations of species belonging to the subgenus. It is found out that the subgenus includes four species: oceanic H. speculiger from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, oceanic H. indicus sp.n. from the waters of the Indian Ocean, nerito-oceanic H. oxycephalus from the waters of the Indo-West Pacific and nerito-oceanic H. affinis from the Atlantic Ocean. The first part of the review focuses on two oceanic species with a large \xe2\x80\x9cmirror\xe2\x80\x9d on the pectoral fins: H. speculiger and H. indicus. A comparison of local populations showed that the species H. indicus is polytypic and consists of two subspecies. One of the subspecies\xe2\x80\x94nominative H. indicus indicus\xe2\x80\x94is distributed in the western and the central parts of the Indian Ocean and the other\xe2\x80\x94H. indicus orientalis ssp.n.\xe2\x80\x94in the Eastern Indian Ocean. Maps showing a geographical distribution of the species and the subspecies in the World Ocean are drawn up.'

'Since the discovery in 1977 that the GC1 gene could be resolved into two common subcomponents on an isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel, a large number of ethnic groups have been screened to analyze the extent of genetic variation in human populations. Using the IEF technique, approximately 50,000 individuals from 160 different populations have been tested for the GC polymorphism. A marked variation in common GC suballele frequencies in different geographic areas seems to correlate with skin pigmentation and intensity of sun light. Pigmented (black) and keratinized (yellowish) skin type populations have a relatively high frequency of the GC*IF allele as compared to white skin populations. By comparison non-pigmented and non-keratinized white skin populations are generally characterized by having the maximum values of the GC*IS allele. The anthropologic significance of the GC locus has been enhanced further by detecting additional unique GC variants which provide useful information about evolutionary links between different populations. However, the presence of some electrophoretically identical unique variants in genetically and geographically distinct populations demand further investigation of these allelic variants to shed more light on their origins.'

'This paper suggests that for environmental education to have any meaning in the South Pacific, the variety of physical and cultural environments must be taken into account. It is not possible, however, for each country to develop its own programme, and thus, a kind of \xe2\x80\x9cdependent development\xe2\x80\x9d which is sustainable should be undertaken. Environmental education is much wider than utilising formal educational curricula; it should include the use of the media, the employment of environmental economists, and a continuous sharing of information between those who carry out environmental research and those who design and implement policy.'

'Geographical Reconnaissance (GR) operations using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have been conducted in the elimination provinces of Temotu, Solomon Islands and Tafea, Republic of Vanuatu.

'One of the most important questions I ask as both a cultural anthropologist and a university teacher is: How do people come to know what they think they know? In this article, I adopt a narrative approach to processes of learning and discovery in two very different locales, an indigenous society in the South Pacific, and a senior seminar on contemporary anthropological theory in a Canadian university. I show how I developed an exercise to \xe2\x80\x9cbring the field into the classroom\xe2\x80\x9d and how my students helped me to take what we learned in the classroom back to the field. In my conclusions, I discuss lessons I and my students learned about the link between experience and understanding, about the nature of interpretation, and about the role of reflexivity in the construction of meaning.'

'The primary pollinator of Polynesian heliconias,Heliconia laufao andH. paka, is the Wattled Honeyeater,Foulehaio carunculata. This report is the first documentation of pollination by honeyeaters in the genusHeliconia and the first record ofF. carunculata as a pollinator of a plant species. The Polynesian heliconias bear inflorescences that produce 2\xe2\x80\x934 hermaphroditic flowers per day for a period of 2\xe2\x80\x933 months. Each flower secretes abundant nectar (125\xe2\x80\x93184 \xce\xb5l) with low sugar concentration (15\xe2\x80\x9318% sucrose-equivalents, weight per weight basis) which is available at anthesis just before dawn. Ninety percent of flower visits occur between anthesis and mid-morning. The honeyeaters perch on inflorescence bracts, and probing of the flower results in pollen deposition on the head and bill from where pollen is transferred between flowers. No statements on compatibility can be made forHeliconia paka; however,Heliconia laufao appears to be self-compatible. Calculations of energetic values of nectar of the Polynesian heliconias and Daily Energy Expenditures ofF. carunculata suggest that populations ofH. laufao andH. paka serve as rich energy resources for their pollinators.'

'This paper compares the socio-spatial characteristics of two missions dating from different periods in Torres Strait, northeastern Australia. It builds upon previous archaeological research which correlates settlement-subsistence systems with the seascape cosmologies of marine specialists. Against the backdrop of profound changes in colonial governance and religious commitment (from mission to church) from the late nineteenth to mid twentieth centuries, we map the changing structure of two Torres Strait missions, and reflect upon these changes relative to lived sea-space. We use this approach in the belief that \xe2\x80\x9clocal\xe2\x80\x9d histories provide meaningful context to broader colonial narratives.'

' The dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) has an expressed polymorphism in the third exon that may have functional relevance. The polymorphism exists at two levels. At the higher level there is an imperfect tandem repeat of 48 base pairs (bp) coding for 16 amino acids; alleles have been identified with 2 (32 amino acids) to 10 (160 amino acids) repeats. The imperfect nature of the repeats is responsible for a more subtle level of variation since alleles with the same number of repeats can differ in the exact sequences or in the order of the variants of the 48-bp unit. We have undertaken a global survey of this expressed polymorphism as one approach to understanding the evolutionary significance and origins of the polymorphism as well as understanding what selective forces, if any, may be operating at this locus. As the first step, we have determined the repeat number genotype of the DRD4 repeat polymorphism in 1,327 individuals from 36 different populations. The allele frequencies differ considerably among the different populations. The 4-repeat allele was the most prevalent (global mean allele frequency = 64.3%) and appeared in every population with a frequency ranging from 0.16 to 0.96. The 7-repeat allele was the second most common (global mean = 20.6%), appearing quite frequently in the Americas (mean frequency = 48.3%) but only occasionally in East and South Asia (mean frequency = 1.9%). The 2-repeat allele was the third most common (global mean frequency = 8.2%) and was quite frequent in East and South Asia (mean frequency = 18.1%) while uncommon in the Americas (mean frequency = 2.9%) and Africa (mean frequency = 1.7%). The universality of the polymorphism with only three common repeat-number alleles (4, 7, and 2) indicates that the polymorphism is ancient and arose before the global dispersion of modern humans. The diversity of actual allele frequencies for this expressed polymorphism among different populations emphasizes the importance of population considerations in the design and interpretation of any association studies carried out with this polymorphism.'

'An analysis of human population trends from 2000 to 2010 shows that of the roughly one billion additional people on the planet today, a disproportionate number live in the biodiversity hotspots and tropical wilderness areas (TWAs). Although the annual population growth rate in the hotspots declined from 1.6 to 1.3\xc2\xa0%, the total population increased by 187 million people. While less densely populated, the TWAs grew at roughly twice the rate of the hotspots. Overall, slower growth rates are indicative of longer-term global trends in decreasing fertility, aging populations, and increased urbanization. The hotspots, however, are largely inhabited by people who have yet to enter their reproductive years or are in the early stages therein. The young age structure means that populations in these priority conservation areas will grow even as fertility rates fall further, and biodiversity will be forced to share dwindling natural habitat with ever more people.'

'The second part of the review of the subgenus Hirundichthys s.str. dealt with two nerito-oceanic species of the subgenus which have weakly pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cmirror\xe2\x80\x9d on the pectoral fins: H. oxycephalus and H. affinis. The validity of H. coromandelensis (Hornell, 1923) as a subspecies of H. oxycephalus is restored. A comparison of local populations showed that H. oxycephalus is a polytypic species and forms three subspecies: nominative H. oxycephalus oxycephalus from the Western Pacific and Eastern Indian Ocean, H. oxycephalus coromandelensis from the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and adjoining waters of the Indian Ocean, and known by the only specimen from the waters of New Guinea H. oxycephalus frereensis ssp.n. Populations of H. affinis from the Western and Eastern Atlantic differ in the color of pectoral fins. Maps showing the geographical distribution of species and subspecies in the World Ocean are drawn up. A key for identification of species and subspecies belonging to the subgenus is proposed.'

"Women's fishing in Oceania has been overlooked in most subsistence studies in the region and, as a consequence, there are few quantitative data available upon which to base an assessment of its importance. However, in the present study, the few data available on women's fishing in Oceania are examined, and these show that women contribute significantly to marine food yields in the region. Also, it is suggested that the highly regular nature of women's fishing makes women more reliable, and therefore more effective than men as suppliers of protein for subsistence. The implications of these findings for future development policies in the region are then discussed."

'From a mtDNA dominant perspective, the exit from Africa of modern humans to colonize Eurasia occurred once, around 60 kya, following a southern coastal route across Arabia and India to reach Australia short after. These pioneers carried with them the currently dominant Eurasian lineages M and N. Based also on mtDNA phylogenetic and phylogeographic grounds, some authors have proposed the coeval existence of a northern route across the Levant that brought mtDNA macrohaplogroup N to Australia. To contrast both hypothesis, here we reanalyzed the phylogeography and respective ages of mtDNA haplogroups belonging to macrohaplogroup M in different regions of Eurasia and Australasia.'

'Advocates of traditional, agriculture-based models of sociopolitical evolution argue that the adoption of domesticates is requisite for developments such as sedentism, village life, ascribed status, hereditary leadership, and other features that underpin institutionalized political complexity. We counter in this essay with a well-documented suite of politically complex hunter-gatherer (CHG) societies that exhibit these same features, thereby demonstrating that reliance on agriculture per se\xe2\x80\x94or any other specific food regime such as fishing\xe2\x80\x94should be excised from explanations of emergent political complexity. Despite the failure of the agricentric model to account for a significant number of cases of institutionalized complexity, some of its architects remain entrenched in their disbelief and rigidly ignore the implications of CHG studies. By continuing to situate farming as foundational to everything complex, they perpetuate not only a story of human cultural evolution\xc2\xa0over the last 10,000\xc2\xa0years that is incomplete but also a narrative that is incorrect. We reject subsistence (domesticates) as the central organizing principle and introduce here a new forum for thinking about how societies operate and evolve. We propose a model consisting of integrated platforms of societal dynamics that are inclusive (encourage discourse of all societies), nonprogressive, and serve as an organizational structure to discuss cultural evolution in any comparative or singular ethnographic context. The platforms are nonhierarchical and not fixed in order or importance. They are (1) agency and authority, (2) social differentiation, (3) participation in communal events, (4) organization of production, (5) labor obligations, (6) articulation of ecology and subsistence, and (7) territoriality and ownership. All sociopolitical cases and all topics can be productively discussed on these platforms, from bands to the largest empires, comparatively or diachronically. In the present article, we use the platforms to examine political evolution. We assemble considerable evidence that a variety of dietary regimes are associated with the emergence of institutionalized political complexity. Rather than diet,\xc2\xa0it is the ways people integrate and use labor\xc2\xa0that demands our attention.'

'The sclerophyll forests which once extended over the lowlands of the west coast of New Caledonia are now reduced to small fragments representing about 2% (10 000 ha) of their original area. Much of the remaining forests are degraded. Threats to sclerophyll forests come from land clearance, grazing by cattle or deer, and fire. In sclerophyll forests, 223 endemic phanerogam species occur and 59 of these are specific to this forest type. Several of the 59 specific species are known only from a few plants at a single locality and are critically endangered. Pittosporum tanianum sp. nov. became extinct shortly after its discovery in 1988, and becomes the first documented plant extinction in New Caledonia. A further 15 species of New Caledonian plants, not recorded for several decades, are discussed, and it is concluded that between 4 and 9 of them may be extinct. The existing reserves containing sclerophyll forests are inadequate to protect the remaining biodiversity of the forests. Four immediate steps needed to protect sclerophyll forests are (i) restoration of Lepr\xc3\xa9dour Island; (ii) purchase and restoration of selected privately owned forests; (iii) management of publicly owned forest near N\xc3\xa9poui; and (iv) ex situ conservation of certain species.'

'Knowledge of New Caledonian palms (Arecaceae) has increased dramatically during the past few years with a wealth of new morphological, anatomical, ecological and molecular data now available. This information makes necessary several changes in the definition of New Caledonian endemic genera. In this article, we present a synopsis of all palm genera of New Caledonia and the subtribes to which they belong, keys for their identification, and a checklist of the species with new combinations where necessary. We retain nine genera of Areceae instead of the 15 previously recognised. The monotypic genera Alloschmidia, Campecarpus, Moratia, Lavoixia and Veillonia, and the bispecific genus Brongniartikentia, are reduced into synonymy with other genera. We provide a description and discussion of the correspondingly enlarged genera Basselinia, Cyphophoenix, Cyphokentia and Clinosperma, as well as notes on the four subtribes now recognised on the island: Livistoninae, Archontophoenicinae, Clinospermatinae and Basseliniinae. In addition, we formally incorporate the monotypic genus Lepidorrhachis from Lord Howe Island within the Basseliniinae. As a result of the changes made here at the generic and specific levels, the family Arecaceae in New Caledonia now comprises 10 genera and 38 species. Five new combinations are made.'

'Otolith shape analysis has been used in a number of studies as an inexpensive and powerful method for categorising fish in individual stocks. Elliptical Fourier analysis was used on three different amphidromous Sicyopterus species. Sicyopterus lagocephalus is a widespread species while the other two have a limited distribution area, Sicyopterus aiensis being endemic to Vanuatu, and Sicyopterus sarasini to New Caledonia. Both endemics live in sympatry with the widespread species. The otolith shape of all fish sampled was a clear species differentiator, thereby demonstrating that otolith shape is species-specific. At an intraspecific level there are different river populations within samples from Vanuatu, indicating a western group and an eastern \xe2\x80\x9ccentral\xe2\x80\x9d group.These results are congruent both for the endemic species, S. aiensis and for the cosmopolitan species. Finally, we found that, for S. lagocephalus, the cosmopolitan species, New Caledonian samples are close to western Vanuatu samples, the latter two being well differentiated from the eastern \xe2\x80\x9ccentral\xe2\x80\x9d Vanuatu samples. The explanation for these results may lay either in the influence of environmental factors on the otolith shape, or in the influence of common early life history thus reflecting genetic factors, or a combination of both.'

'Earthquake damage data is of vital importance both as an indicator of the likely performance of buildings in future earthquakes, as well as for the calibration of existing theoretical-analytical models regarding building vulnerability.

However, promising means in strengthening the existing masonry stock emerge, when considering the improved performance of buildings of a dual-system of stone-masonry and timber frame \xe2\x80\x93 a construction practice uniquely adopted in the island.

'Archaeological wood charcoal analysis or anthracology has been applied for the first time in New Caledonia as part of an interdisciplinary research program examining Kanak pre-colonial landscape management in a valley on the northeast coast of the subtropical Pacific island. In contrast to previous hypotheses, this study demonstrated that when the Kanak traditional cultural complex emerged around ad 1000, following the initial 2,000\xc2\xa0years of human presence on the island, the vegetation cover showed few signs of deforestation and the tropical rainforests were still prominent. The vegetation surrounding Kanak settlement sites evolved during the first half of the 2nd millennium ad  towards a more open but more complex composition that included useful taxa. This was interpreted as showing a form of forest management and possible arboriculture (the cultivation and management of trees). However, in sharp contrast to its Melanesian neighbours, very little is known about arboricultural practices in New Caledonia. Through the interpretation of data from two sites in particular, a discussion of the two-step analytical process is used to argue for the existence of arboricultural practices associated with these sites: (1) using anthracological data to reconstruct the vegetational landscape, together with ethnobotanical, ethnohistorical and archaeological data; (2) allowing for the recognition of specific practices of forest domestication, based on the manipulation of plants and of spatial patterns of forests. At a time when archaeology is engaged in a process of post-colonial re-evaluation of its schemes of interpretation, it seems timely for archaeobotany to try integrating more indigenous systems of representation into its analyses. The approach presented here is an effort in this direction, trying to make sense of new data by reading them through a local lens.'

'This paper compares two contemporary aesthetic expressions: tourist art from the Sepik River in Papua New Guinea and the New Guinea Sculpture Garden at Stanford University. Both aesthetic expressions undermine the conventional categories that classify art. Sepik River tourist art is motivated not by the drive to lend individual, subjective experience a material expression but by monetary desire. The New Guinea Sculpture Garden was expressly created so that Sepik artisans could expand beyond the confines of village traditions and create unfettered aesthetic expressions. But seemingly inauthentic Tourist Art actually represents many of the ideals normally ascribed to Western masterpieces, or High Art. Conversely, the High Art of the Sculpture Garden in many respects resembles inauthentic reproductions and the tenacity of traditional forms. Both tourist art and the sculpture Garden, however, have one key quality in common: they rupture conventional artistic cattegories.'

'Bee diversity of the Southwest Pacific has been reported as depauperate despite the otherwise rich biodiversity and complex geological history for this region. However, due to a lack of bee-specific sampling, there is potential for higher bee diversity than previous studies suggest. Here, we review the current literature to summarise the extant diversity for each of the main island groups, the likely passages of species dispersal, and outline the main threats to Southwest Pacific populations. As key pollinators for both cultivated and native angiosperms, ensuring the persistence of native bee populations is critical for both food security and biodiversity conservation. With impending threats from land use change, invasive species and climate change, among others, understanding the true species diversity is important for assigning conservation priorities. We argue that future research in the region must encourage local expertise and build this into global research directions in an effort to address a lack of fundamental knowledge of bee diversity in island ecosystems.'

"In this article I maintain that different constellations of political and socio-economic interest groups lead to diverging approaches to defining research targets in population genetics. First, I show how different political and socio-cultural views of possible target groups in the People's Republic of China and in the Republic of China have crucial consequences for the ways in which scientists define their research subject, collect and interpret their genetic samples, and conduct their research. Thus the unit of research, or group delineation, in genetic population studies cannot be viewed separately from its political and social context. Second, examples from population genetics in the People's Republic of China are used to show how genetic approaches to populations are necessarily mediated by social and political categories, which may or may not lead to conflicting interpretations of genetic data. Finally, in China and Taiwan research target groups are defined through different cultural and political perceptions intimately linked to these two nations\xe2\x80\x99 positions as players on the international political and diplomatic stage. Moreover, international and national competition and research politics affect sampling strategies and the selection of research populations. The political and economic issues related to the definition of socio-genetic groups are shown to have implications for bioethical debates."

'Ambrym in Vanuatu is a persistently degassing island volcano whose inhabitants harvest rainwater for their potable water needs. The findings from this study indicate that dental fluorosis is prevalent in the population due to fluoride contamination of rainwater by the volcanic plume. A dental survey was undertaken of 835 children aged 6\xe2\x80\x9318\xc2\xa0years using the Dean\xe2\x80\x99s Index of Fluorosis. Prevalence of dental fluorosis was found to be 96% in the target area of West Ambrym, 71% in North Ambrym, and 61% in Southeast Ambrym. This spatial distribution appears to reflect the prevailing winds and rainfall patterns on the island. Severe cases were predominantly in West Ambrym, the most arid part of the island, and the most commonly affected by the volcanic plume. Over 50\xc2\xa0km downwind, on a portion of Malakula Island, the dental fluorosis prevalence was 85%, with 36% prevalence on Tongoa Island, an area rarely affected by volcanic emissions. Drinking water samples from West Ambrym contained fluoride levels from 0.7 to 9.5\xc2\xa0ppm F (average 4.2\xc2\xa0ppm\xc2\xa0F, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0158) with 99% exceeding the recommended concentration of 1.0\xc2\xa0ppm\xc2\xa0F. The pathway of fluoride-enriched rainwater impacting upon human health as identified in this study has not previously been recognised in the aetiology of fluorosis. This is an important consideration for populations in the vicinity of degassing volcanoes, particularly where rainwater comprises the primary potable water supply for humans or animals.'

'Aggregated results from twenty years of community-engaged assiduous restoration of severely degraded coastal littoral systems in New Zealand (NZ) reveal numerous fundamental and substantive natural improvements to dune form, function, and storm resilience. This is accomplished by simple, low-cost exclusive utilisation of the variably threatened local indigenous dune plant species. These valuable and innovative enhancements succeed countless decades of cascading consequences from numerous impacts instigated by historic (and frequently continuing) damaging effects on those previously natural coastal dune ecosystems \xe2\x80\x93 impacts that subsequently induced problematic littoral retreat \xe2\x80\x93 the true root cause of prevailing coastal erosion. The durable reversals were often generated in less than two decades, contemporaneously with adverse storm surge and sea level rise conditions. Research reveals many global dune ecosystems are afflicted with analogous normalised degradation and erosion difficulties, with the earliest active circumvention recorded in sixteenth century Denmark (McKelvey 1999). Historic plus current pressures such as coastal settlement impacts and continuing agricultural use of dunelands similarly threaten numerous global littoral margins, alongside recent concerns regarding the compounding effects of climate change. Successful, affordable, diligent dune restoration work pioneered in NZ has extensive benefits for other nations experiencing similarly challenging attrition on degraded coastal zones. Persuasive data is presented to validate the numerous persistently accrued benefits of this cost-effective and enduring coastal adaptation response.'

"\xe2\x80\x82Taveuni is a Fijian ocean-island volcano that sporadically erupted throughout the Holocene. The 437-km2 island is an active monogenetic volcanic field with a constantly shifting locus of activity along a single apparent rift axis. Although the eruptions were not large ( \xe2\x89\xa4VEI 2), unexpected shifts in Taveuni volcanism had the potential to affect habitation sites. Since known human settlement of the Fiji Group (ca. 950\xe2\x80\x93750 BC), there have been at least 58 eruptions on Taveuni. Up to 25 of these eruptions potentially affected pre-European inhabitants of the island and at least four former occupation sites are known to have been affected by volcanic products. Despite apparent earliest settlement of Taveuni post-dating other nearby islands by up to 600\xe2\x80\x89years, volcanism probably did not hinder or stall settlement of Taveuni compared with neighbouring islands. However, a period of voluminous eruptions between 300 and 500 AD covered much of south Taveuni with lava and/or thick tephra, apparently causing abandonment of at least this portion of Taveuni until approximately 1100 AD. Most eruptions were not of catastrophic proportions and, due to their localised effects, re-settlement was rapid in marginal unaffected areas. Localised stories and a relict place name survive to describe former eruption locations and effects since approximately 120\xe2\x80\x93320\xe2\x80\x89AD. Knowledge of the impacts on Taveuni's past inhabitants forms the basis of volcanic disaster-mitigation strategies to minimise future effects on the current 14,500 residents."

'The small carpenter bee, Ceratina (Neoceratina) dentipes, is an invasive species throughout the South Pacific and has been identified as one of three alien Ceratina species established in Hawaii. Invasive bees are thought to be exacerbating declines of Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s native yellow-faced bees (Hylaeus) but, outside of the honey bee (Apis mellifera), relatively little empirical work has been done to track the origins and avenues of introduction for these species. Extant research addressing C. dentipes is limited, but suggests that it is a rapidly moving invasive, morphologically similar to both native and non-native bees within its introduced ecosystems, and may be capable of parthenogenic reproduction. Ceratina dentipes thus represents a potentially serious conservational challenge for terrestrial ecosystems throughout the Pacific. Here, we perform the first comprehensive phylogeographic assessment of C. dentipes, drawing from invasive populations across Hawaii and the South Pacific, and from native populations in Southeast Asia. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction and analyses of molecular variation both indicate that C. dentipes is very recently introduced in Hawaii. Analyses also reveal that invasive populations of C. dentipes likely originated in Borneo or mainland Southeast Asia before being widely and rapidly dispersed, most likely through anthropogenic transport.'

'When examining how the ecosystems of remote islands have developed, it is important to know the timing of when various elements arrived and whether they then diversified. Our understanding of the histories behind the biodiverse south west Pacific (SWP) archipelagos is limited, and further impeded by the complex geological histories of this region. Previous studies of the SWP short-tongued halictine bee fauna suggest their presence is much younger than the geological ages of these archipelagos, which is surprising given their critical role as pollinators in other terrestrial ecosystems. The long-tongued megachilid bees represent a considerable proportion of the known bee species for the region, yet little is known of their origin. Here we use genetic diversity within mitochondrial DNA to infer the likely ages and origins of megachilid species from Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa. Our results indicate a very recent origin for megachilids in the SWP, with many species exhibiting small intraspecific genetic distances. Three species share almost identical haplotypes with specimens from Southeast Asia, suggesting multiple human-aided introductions. Combined with data from recent studies on other bee groups present in the region, our results have broad implications for how the Pacific island biota developed and how we should approach its management.'

'People not always do what they say that they do, nor do they always say what they really do, an opaqueness that seems to be a necessary condition for the production and reproduction of their mutual relations in society. This lesson about the discrepancy between people\xe2\x80\x99s words and their deeds, between verbally expressing social norms for the well-being of everybody while simultaneously striving for individual or group interests, was already taught by Malinowski (Argonauts of the western Pacific: an account of native enterprise and adventure in the archipelagoes of Melanesian New Guinea. Routledge, London, 1922). He may have learned it himself during his own lengthy fieldwork in New Guinea, but it may also have been an anthropological operationalization of the dictum of Freud, with whom Malinowski was struggling intellectually (at least from his side), that people are not always conscious of the motives of their own words and behavior. It also happens, however, that politicians, business, and church people alike consciously create stories or myths in which they hide their own personal our group intentions. These stories or myths are not only works of art of the human mind, but when they are successfully told within the context of, or directly concern power relationships, the narrator may be attributed mana. At least, this is what many Polynesians would do. In this paper, I will give several ethnographic examples from Polynesia, where I have been working for the last 28\xc2\xa0years, in order to defend my theoretical stance concerning asymmetrical ideology and power.'

'International organizations dealing with higher education should pay more attention to the rise of autonomous world regional processes and explore synergies. This article gives an overview of new macro-regional processes around the world. The European case is the most salient, but developments in America and East Asia are also noticeable. In the rest of the world there is potential for innovative regional schemes. The paper outlines policy recommendations to the main multilateral organizations concerned with higher education. It suggests that UNESCO should prioritize monitoring and coordination; that World Trade Organisation\xe2\x80\x93General Agreement on Trade in Services acknowledge the benefit of open regional processes in higher education; and that the World Bank decentralize its work further to regional organizations.'

"This paper presents an analysis of household variables and their relationship to success in cash cropping among the Gainj of Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. Censuses and household surveys from 1978, the year in which cash cropping began, and 1983 provide data that show different patterns of change in household structure for more and less commercially successful households. The results illustrate the importance of women's labor in economic development and the dynamic nature of the relationship between household structure and economic development."

'Genetic factors play a major role in predisposition to diabetes in the Micronesian population of Nauru. In people aged 60 years and older, 83% of full-blooded Nauruans were diabetic compared with 17% of those with ancestral foreign admixture, as detected by HLA typing. HLA distributions also showed a small increased risk for early onset of diabetes (< 46 years) associated with HLA-Bw22 (Bw56). Variation in the restriction fragment length of DNA near the insulin gene was found, but was not associated with diabetes. The distribution in fragment lengths, previously reported in Caucasoids, was observed in healthy Polynesians, Melanesians and Micronesians.'

' Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between alleles on the same human chromosome results from various evolutionary processes and is thus telling about the history of populations. Recently, LD has garnered substantial interest for its value to map and fine-map disease genes. We examine the distribution of LD between short tandem repeat alleles on autosomes and sex chromosomes in the Remote Oceanic population of Palau to evaluate whether the data are consistent with a recent hypothesis about the origins of genetic variation in Palau, specifically that the population experienced extensive male-biased gene flow following initial settlement. Consistent with evolutionary theory based on effective population size, LD between X-linked alleles is stochastically greater than LD between autosomal alleles, however, small but detectable LD occurs for autosomal markers separated by substantial distances. By contrast, while Y-linked alleles experience only one-third the effective population size of X-linked alleles, their mean value for pairwise LD is only slightly larger than X-linked alleles. For a small population known to experience at least two extreme bottlenecks, 56 six-locus Y\xc2\xa0haplotypes exhibit remarkable diversity (0.96), comparable to Y diversity of Europeans, however, autosomal and X-linked markers display significantly less diversity, as measured by heterozygosity (4.1% less). Palauan Y\xc2\xa0haplotypes also fall into distinct clusters, again unlike that of Europe. We argue these data are consistent with waves of male-biased gene flow.'

'Four new bathymetric maps of the Tonga Trench and forearc between 14\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0S and 27\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0S display the important morphologic and structural features of this dynamic convergent margin. The maps document a number of important geologic features of the margin. Major normal faults and fault lineaments on the Tonga platform can be traced along and across the upper trench slope. Numerous submarine canyons incised in the landward slope of the trench mark the pathways of sediment transport from the platform to mid- and lower-slope basins. Discontinuities in the trench axis and changes in the morphology of the landward slope can be clearly documented and may be associated with the passage and subduction of the Louisville Ridge and other structures on the subducting Pacific Plate. Changes in the morphology of the forearc as convergence changes from normal in the south to highly-oblique in the north are clearly documented. The bathymetric compilations, gridded at 500- and 200-m resolutions and extending along \xe2\x88\xbc500\xc2\xa0km of the landward trench slope and axis, provide complete coverage of the outer forearc from the latitude of the Louisville Ridge-Tonga Trench collision to the northern terminus of the Tonga Ridge. These maps should serve as a valuable reference for other sea-going programs in the region, particularly the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) and the National Science Foundation MARGINS initiative.'

'The origins of the New Zealand population are highly diverse. New Zealand M\xc4\x81ori are the indigenous peoples with a population of approximately half a million (~12\xc2\xa0%), with the remainder comprising predominantly European/Caucasian (~50\xc2\xa0%), Pacific Island Polynesian (~28\xc2\xa0%) and Asian (~10\xc2\xa0%) peoples. With a prevalence of overweight and obesity of 65\xc2\xa0% for adults >15\xc2\xa0years of age, of which 28\xc2\xa0% have a BMI\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x8930\xc2\xa0kg/m2, New Zealand has been ranked third highest in a global OECD obesity review, behind only the US and Mexico. Levels of childhood obesity are also significant, with 31\xc2\xa0% of New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s children either overweight or obese. Few gender differences exist, but there are significant differences between ethnicities (Asian\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89European Caucasian\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89M\xc4\x81ori\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89Pacific) with disproportionate representation by those poorer and with less formal education. A high 62\xc2\xa0% of Pacifika are obese and virtually the entire adult population has a BMI >25\xc2\xa0kg/m2. Public health measures to limit progressive increases in weight are unsuccessful, and clearly should be priority for government focused on disease prevention.'

'Throughout Oceania, pit fermentation of starchy crops was used as means of ensuring a predictable food supply despite the vagaries of drought, cyclonic storms, and warfare. During a 6-mo period, fermentation techniques for breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) were studied in Micronesia in the islands comprising Majuro, Guam, Belau, Yap, and Ponape. Fermentation techniques were found to vary throughout Micronensia but as a whole to differ significantly from techniques used in Polynesia. We believe the benefits of such food preservation technologies to be significant in facilitating colonization of temporally marginal island environments.'

'Subduction is not only the counterpart process to seafloor spreading in the plate tectonic regime, but is also the major driving mechanism of plate motions. Various features characteristic to subduction zones are reviewed from a geotectonic viewpoint, and their impacts on human soeciety are considered. The features of subduction zones are difficult to explain by a single model. The importance of recognizing the existence of two basic and contrasted modes in subduction, controlled by the strength of coupling between subducting and overriding plates, is demonstrated. The two modes are High Stress Chilean-type subduction and Low Stress Mariana-type subduction. Collision and accretion of buoyant features on seafloor, an inevitable consequence of subduction, is important in the evolution of continents.'

'In the early 2000s, Esteban Burchard and his colleagues defended a controversial route to the view that there\xe2\x80\x99s a racial classification of people that\xe2\x80\x99s (epistemically) useful in medicine. The route, which I call \xe2\x80\x98Burchard\xe2\x80\x99s route,\xe2\x80\x99 is arguing that there\xe2\x80\x99s a racial classification of people that\xe2\x80\x99s useful in medicine because, roughly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a racial classification with medically relevant genetic differentiation (Risch et al. in Genome Biol 1\xe2\x80\x9312, 2002; Burchard et al. in N Engl J Med 348(12):1170\xe2\x80\x931175, 2003). While almost all scholars engaged in this debate agree that there\xe2\x80\x99s a racial classification of people that\xe2\x80\x99s useful in medicine in some way, there\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous controversy over whether any racial scheme is useful in medicine because there are medically relevant genetic differences among those races (Yudell et al. in Science 351(6273): 564\xe2\x80\x93565, 2016). The goal of this paper will be to show that Burchard\xe2\x80\x99s route is basically correct. However, I will use a slightly different argument than Burchard et al.\xe2\x80\x99s in order to provide a firmer foundation for the thesis, both metaphysically and genetically. I begin by reviewing Burchard\xe2\x80\x99s route and its critics. Second, I present an original argument for establishing Burchard et al.\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion using a Burchard-like route. I call it \xe2\x80\x98Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s route\xe2\x80\x99. I reply to major objections along the way, and I end with a summary.'

'Academic interest in official systems of racial and ethnic classification has grown in recent years, but most research on such census categories has been limited to small case studies or regional surveys. In contrast, this article analyzes a uniquely global data set compiled by the United Nations Statistical Division to survey the approaches to ethnic enumeration taken in 141 countries. The motives for this analysis combine theoretical, applied, and policy objectives. I find that 63% of the national censuses studied incorporate some form of ethnic enumeration, but their question and answer formats vary along several dimensions that betray diverse conceptualizations of ethnicity (for example, as \xe2\x80\x9crace\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnationality\xe2\x80\x9d). Moreover, these formats follow notably regional patterns. Nonetheless, the variety of approaches can be grouped into a basic taxonomy of ethnic classification approaches, suggesting greater commonality in worldwide manifestations of the ethnicity concept than some have recognized.'

'Many studies of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus assume that the condition is homogeneous and clearly defined. There are, however, several problems with these assumptions. Thus, definition of Type 2 diabetes is one of exclusion of other types (insulin-dependent, malnutrition-related, gestational and other rarer types) and inevitably contains a heterogeneous group of disorders the aetiology of which is largely unclear, and separation from the insulin-dependent type can be problematic. Diagnosis is also imprecise in asymptomatic subjects due to the lack of accurate diagnostic tools and lack of clear distinction of impaired glucose tolerance. An alternative to the oral glucose tolerance test is urgently needed. Epidemiological studies of Type 2 diabetes and its complications are also fraught with difficulties due to variability of the oral glucose tolerance test, potential problems in glucose measurement, heterogeneity, population selection and problems in international comparisons due to differing age structures and life expectancy. Great care is needed in all studies of Type 2 diabetes to ensure that the groups under study are properly selected, well-defined and fully described.'

'Serum samples from 170 unrelated individuals from the Suceava District of Roumania and from 199 unrelated individuals from Bucharest, Roumania were tested for Gm(1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 14, 17, 21) and Km(1)[Inv(1)]. Selected samples were also tested for Gm(15) and Gm(16).'

'The integration of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) into formal school curricula may be a key tool for the revitalisation of biocultural diversity, and has the potential to improve the delivery of educational objectives. This paper explores perceptions of the value of TEK to formal education curricula on Malekula Island, Vanuatu. We conducted 49 interviews with key stakeholders (local TEK experts, educators, and officials) regarding the use of the formal school system to transmit, maintain, and revitalise TEK. Interviews also gathered information on the areas where TEK might add value to school curricula and on the perceived barriers to maintaining and revitalising TEK via formal education programs.'

'Polynesians\xe2\x80\x99 detailed observations of shark behaviour encompass the notion of a divinity, the fleeting image of a sky god, as well as potential source of food and valued tools. Due to prevailing cosmogony, sharks benefited from being a taboo species, historically limiting their exploitation. We examine how the reputedly fierce warriors of \xe2\x80\x98Anaa (an atoll in Tuamotu archipelago, French Polynesia) came to be symbolically identified with a marine predator, being called \xe2\x80\x9cParata,\xe2\x80\x9d the vernacular name of the oceanic whitetip shark Carcharinus longimanus. Both sharks and indigenous cultures are currently under threat in the East Pacific and we propose that an understanding of these sacred relationships could be used to help protect them.'

'Rising poverty is a cause of concern for international, regional and local organisations and policy makers. A contributing factor is urbanisation and growth in the urban informal economy which has both beneficial and detrimental effects on the urban formal economy. This study utilises primary data from two cities and a town to examine the contribution of the urban informal sector to employment creation and poverty alleviation. The findings reveal a significant positive contribution of the informal sector towards poverty alleviation and income generation.'

'This study presents results of surveys conducted along the slow to ultra-slow spreading axis of the Northern North Fiji Basin (NNFB), including the Hazel Holmes, Tripartite and South Pandora Ridges, and the newly discovered Futuna and North Cikobia spreading centers. Spreading segments along these axes display highly contrasted axial morphologies, ranging from a rift valley to a prominent axial high. In some places, abrupt inversions of topography are observed between neighboring segments. Detailed analyses of bathymetry and backscatter maps reveal that axial highs are spotted with numerous coalescent volcanoes forming features ranging from irregular terrains to well-organized ridges. The volcanic edifices are distributed over a wide neovolcanic zone, which corresponds to the axial relief, suggesting on important contribution of volcanism to the relief construction. Comparisons between various ridge-shaped segments reveal that axial volcano-tectonic patterns are directly related to the local magma production and delivery, in a context of tectonic extension related to plate divergence, and suggest that coalescent volcanoes are fed from multiples short-lived and unconnected magma lenses. In the competition between horizontal and vertical accretion of oceanic crust, the spreading centers of the NNFB represent a special case where lava production is locally high enough and spreading rate is low enough to allow prominent axial highs to develop. The along axis morphologic variability is related to intermittent volcanic activity that may result from rapid temporal and spatial variations in the distribution of upper mantle convection cells below accretion centers, superimposed on the regional thermal anomaly located under the whole basin.'

'This article seeks to determine whether PT Freeport Indonesia, an operating subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., has acted in environmentally and socially responsible ways in the context of its operations in Papua, Indonesia, and how well it has responded to the legacy left by its less responsible operations from 1973 until the mid-1990s. This objective is achieved by examining the company\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the resources and assets with which it comes into contact as part of its operations, as well as through a historical review of the province of Papua and its incorporation into Indonesia, Freeport\xe2\x80\x99s entry into Papua, and the company\xe2\x80\x99s engagement with international and Indonesian politics.'

'Type II diabetes is a multifactorial disease with a complex etiology. Numerous genes have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. In particular, SNPs at the TCF7L2 locus have consistently shown strong associations with type II diabetes. This study characterizes the global distribution of type II diabetes-associated TCF7L2 SNPs utilizing HapMap, HGDP\xe2\x80\x93CEPH, and Alfred databases and the literature. High frequencies of rs7903146(T), rs12255372(T), and rs7901695(C) SNPs are observed in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, but they are reduced and almost absent in Southeast Asian and Native American populations. In contrast, rs11196218(A) has the highest frequency in Eurasia but is reduced in sub-Saharan African and Native American populations. Regional variations in rs7903146(T) follow a gradient of decreasing frequency from southern into northeastern Europe. These findings demonstrate extensive global and regional variations in the frequencies of TCF7L2 SNPs, which may contribute to differences in the incidence of type II diabetes worldwide.'

'A 95% follow-up of all known diabetic patients in one racial group in Papua New Guinea was performed. Mortality was high with an average life-span of 4\xe2\x80\x935 years from the time of diagnosis. Microvascular diabetic complications were detected in over half of the surviving diabetic patients whose average duration of known disease was 3.8 years. At present, diabetes mellitus is both a rapidly fatal and morbid disease in Papua New Guinea.'

'Southeast Asia (SEA) is enriched with a complex history of peopling. Malaysia, which is located at the crossroads of SEA, has been recognized as one of the hubs for early human migration. To unravel the genomic complexity of the native inhabitants of Malaysia, we sequenced 12 samples from 3 indigenous populations from Peninsular Malaysia and 4 native populations from North Borneo to a high coverage of 28\xe2\x80\x9337\xc3\x97. We showed that the Negritos from Peninsular Malaysia shared a common ancestor with the East Asians, but exhibited some level of gene flow from South Asia, while the North Borneo populations exhibited closer genetic affinity towards East Asians than the Malays. The analysis of time of divergence suggested that ancestors of Negrito were the earliest settlers in the Malay Peninsula, whom first separated from the Papuans ~\xc2\xa050\xe2\x80\x9333 thousand years ago (kya), followed by East Asian (~\xc2\xa040\xe2\x80\x9315\xc2\xa0kya), while the divergence time frame between North Borneo and East Asia populations predates the Austronesian expansion period implies a possible pre-Neolithic colonization. Substantial Neanderthal ancestry was confirmed in our genomes, as was observed in other East Asians. However, no significant difference was observed, in terms of the proportion of Denisovan gene flow into these native inhabitants from Malaysia. Judging from the similar amount of introgression in the Southeast Asians and East Asians, our findings suggest that the Denisovan gene flow may have occurred before the divergence of these populations and that the shared similarities are likely an ancestral component.'

'Studies of the deep structure of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s crust, lithosphere, and asthenosphere (tectonosphere) of transition zones from continents to oceans is one of the urgent issues of present-day geology and geophysics. The most important information on the deep structure of such zones is provided by seismic and seismological methods. Meanwhile, a comparison between gravity data and results of seismic studies showed that the gravity anomalies observed in the marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean cannot be explained solely by changes in the thickness and composition of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s crust. In order to estimate the internal structure of the Pacific type of transition zones, the authors performed an analysis of the anomalous gravity field and the field of geoid heights in the Indonesian region, which also included calculations of the values of the gravity field and geoid heights in different reductions (Bouguer, Glenny, and isostatic), their transformations, and compilation of density models of the tectonosphere of the transition zone of this region compatible with the geological and geophysical data available. As a result of these studies, we performed zonation of the Indonesian region with respect to the gravity field and defined particular features of the areas distinguished. Based on the analysis performed, we inferred the existence of differences in the structure of individual zones both in the upper layers of the tectonosphere and in deeper layers. Detailed characteristics of the anomalous gravity fields typical of the objects distinguished are presented.'

'Meriam children are active reef-flat collectors. We demonstrate that while foraging on the reef, children are significantly less selective than adults. This difference and the precise nature of children\xe2\x80\x99s selectivity while reef-flat collecting are consistent with a hypothesis that both children and adults attempt to maximize their rate of return while foraging, but in so doing they face different constraints relative to differences in walking speeds while searching. Implications of these results for general arguments about factors that shape differences between child and adult behavior and human life-histories are explored.'

'A study of the distribution of \xce\xb1-thalassemia in Papua New Guinea (PNG) was carried out by DNA analysis. A total of 664 DNA samples were screened for \xce\xb1-thalassemia 2 and \xce\xb1-thalassemia 1 caused respectively by either deletion of one or both of the duplicated \xce\xb1-globin genes. \xce\xb1-Thalassemia 2 was detected in high frequencies in coastal and lowland regions where malaria has been holo- to hyperendemic but in low frequencies in non-malarious highland regions. The highest frequency was observed in the north coast of PNG. The distribution of \xce\xb1-thalassemia 2 seems to be in accordance with other conditions such as ovalocytosis and G6PD deficiency which are also prevalent in this population, suggesting that they may interact in protection against malaria. However, it appears to be negatively correlated with \xce\xb2-thalassemia and \xce\xb1-thalassemia 1, the latter being extremely rare in this population. Analysis of the types and subtypes of the single \xce\xb1-globin gene deletion revealed a predominance of the \xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb14.2 type in general, except in some regions in the south where the \xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb13.7 type is prevalent. The \xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb13.7 I subtype is the common form of the \xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb13.7 deletion in the PNG mainland. The \xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb13.7 III subtype, previously reported to be unique in Melanesians and Polynesians, was detected in an offshore island of PNG. However, this subtype is very rare in Melanesians from the PNG mainland.'

'Citrus indica and C. macroptera are the wild endangered species of Citrus occurring in northeastern India. Surveys were undertaken in this region for ascertaining distribution, studying variability and for collection of germplasm of these two species. C. indica, an endemic species of this region, was collected from the Citrus Gene Sanctuary located in buffer zone of Nokrek Biosphere Reserve in the Garo hills of Meghalaya. In addition, a putative natural hybrid of C. indica and C. limon was collected for the first time from the south Garo hills. C. macroptera had much wider distribution and was collected from Mizoram and Meghalaya states. In Jantia hills of Meghalaya, natural populations of this species are in a highly threatened state. The two species were unevenly distributed all over the explored territory. Morphological characterization of leaves, fruits and seeds indicated the presence of sizable variability within collected accessions of these two Citrus species. Indigenous technical knowledge gathered on the use and socio-economic importance indicated commercial potential for these two species in northeastern India. However, lack of cultivation of these species and clearing of forest cover at an alarming rate has led to an urgent need to adopt complementary conservation strategies to safeguard these species and to ensure their availability for future utilization. A major emphasis on developing methods for their propagation, multiplication and regeneration in in situ and ex situ conditions is required.'

'The vast majority of researchers are proponents of the hypothesis of the formation of Homo sapiens in Africa and its subsequent spread throughout the world. The authors of this paper suggest a new model of the origin of anatomically modern humans. It is based on the latest paleogenetic and anthropological findings in the Russian Altai, in particular, the archaeological materials from the Denisova Cave. Scientific innovations associated with the discoveries in the Denisova Cave have aroused interest in scientists of related fields of knowledge, who took part in the discussion of the paper, which Academician A.P. Derevyanko presented at an RAS Presidium meeting.'

'Halofantrine is an orally administered blood schizontocide which is active against both chloro-quine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant plasmodia. Dose-finding and noncomparative clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of halofantrine in the treatment of falciparum malaria in areas of chloroquine- and sulfonamide/pyrimethamine-resistant malaria and vivax malaria. However, poor results obtained in patients who failed mefloquine prophylaxis suggest that the efficacy of halofantrine may not extend to mefloquine-resistant P. falciparum, although more studies are needed to confirm this. Data concerning halofantrine in the treatment of P. ovale and P. malariae infections are still limited. One comparative study indicates that halofantrine has an efficacy equivalent to that of mefloquine and may be better tolerated.'

'This paper presents a simple and practical method for stratifying taro germplasm based on morpho-agronomical characters. More than 450 accessions of taro collected throughout Vanuatu and established in a field collection were described using 19 descriptors. A hierarchical approach was used to stratify the agro-morphological variation. Three sampling strategies were tested and the variation captured within each sample was compared for the frequencies of characters. The first sample (S1) was randomly selected; the second sample (S2) was conducted within the subgroups produced by the stratification method, and the third sample (S3) was based on UPGMA clustering within each subgroup. AFLP markers were used to compare the diversity between S3 and a fourth sample (S4) that included the parents of the Vanuatu breeding programme, and more diversity was found in S3. AFLPs were found to be useful to validate the hierarchical approach used for stratification. These studies have confirmed the narrow genetic base of the Vanuatu taro germplasm. They have been useful for detecting duplicates and fingerprinting of accessions.'

'\xc2\xb6The epithermal, low sulfidation Emperor gold telluride deposit in Fiji, hosted by Late Miocene-Early Pliocene shoshonitic rocks, is spatially related to a low-grade porphyry Cu system on the western flank of the Tavua Caldera. Gold is largely in the form of \xe2\x80\x9cinvisible\xe2\x80\x9d gold in arsenian pyrite but 10 to 50% of gold is in the form of precious metal tellurides. Gold mineralization occurs in steeply dipping dikes and faults, flat-dipping structures (<45\xc2\xb0), referred to locally as \xe2\x80\x9cflatmakes,\xe2\x80\x9d and at the intersection of two or more structures referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cshatter zones.\xe2\x80\x9d Petrographic, electron microprobe, and scanning electron microscope analyses of ores from some of the more recently discovered orebodies, Matanagata, Matanagata East, and R1 reveal that tellurium-bearing minerals, sylvanite, calaverite, krennerite, petzite, hessite, coloradoite, melonite, native tellurium, and rare benleonardite, formed during various hydrothermal stages, hosted in quartz, and to a lesser extent arsenian pyrite and tetrahedrite group minerals. Sylvanite followed by krennerite are the two most common tellurides in these orebodies. These tellurides show no systematic spatial distribution within flatmakes but there appears to be a higher concentration of tellurides where the flatmake intersects steep structures. Gold-rich tellurides preceded the formation of silver-rich tellurides and were constrained at 250\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0C in log f\xe2\x80\x89S2 and log f\xe2\x80\x89Te2 space at \xe2\x88\x9212.7 to \xe2\x88\x9210.1 and \xe2\x88\x929.4 to \xe2\x88\x927.8, respectively, based on sulfide and telluride stabilities, and the composition of sphalerite. Ore forming components, such as Au, Ag, Te, Cu, V, and S, were likely derived from Late Miocene-Early Pliocene monzonites in and adjacent to the Tavua caldera.'

'In recent years, cultural anthropologists have made notable progress in understanding the bewildering variety of material exchange transactions found among the aboriginal populations of highland New Guinea. One of the major findings of this work is that competitive exchange behavior may bring in its wake alterations in agronomic practices involving an intensification of production. That intensification is primarily a product of social behavior, rather than an adaptation to climate change or population pressure, is a significant conclusion that should influence the thinking of archaeologists as they investigate past episodes of agronomic change, including the origins of agriculture.'

'The increasing pressure from different facets of society exerted on multinational companies (MNCs) to become more philanthropic and claim ownership of their impacts is now becoming a standard practice. Although research in corporate social responsibility (CSR) has arguably been recent (see subsequent section), the application of activities taking a voluntary form from MNCs seem to vary reflecting a plethora of factors, particularly one obvious being the backwater local communities of developing countries where most of the natural extraction projects are located. This chapter examines views of two Papua New Guinea (PNG) local communities hosting large-scale mining operations and explains the demands arising from situational relativities, which are becoming too conspicuous for mine developers not to ignore. The research undertaken with several assertions highlights the perceived imperativeness allowing companies to integrate the CSR into the essential management pursuits of running mines in PNG.'

'Blanchard et al. (2009) demonstrated that hebephilia is a genuine sexual preference, but then proposed, without argument or evidence, that it should be designated as a mental disorder in the DSM-5. A series of Letters-to-the-Editor criticized this proposal as a non sequitur. Blanchard (2009), in rebuttal, reaffirmed his position, but without adequately addressing some central criticisms. In this article, we examine hebephilia-as-disorder in full detail. Unlike Blanchard et al., we discuss definitions of mental disorder, examine extensive evidence from a broad range of sources, and consider alternative (i.e., non-pathological) explanations for hebephilia. We employed Wakefield\xe2\x80\x99s (1992b) harmful dysfunction approach to disorder, which holds that a condition only counts as a disorder when it is a failure of a naturally selected mechanism to function as designed, which is harmful to the individual in the current environment. We also considered a harmful-for-others approach to disorder (Br\xc3\xbclde, 2007). Examination of historical, cross-cultural, sociological, cross-species, non-clinical empirical, and evolutionary evidence and perspectives indicated that hebephilic interest is an evolved capacity and hebephilic preference an expectable distributional variant, both of which were adaptively neutral or functional, not dysfunctional, in earlier human environments. Hebephilia\xe2\x80\x99s conflict with modern society makes it an evolutionary mismatch, not a genuine disorder. Though it should not be classified as a disorder, it could be entered in the DSM\xe2\x80\x99s 5-code section, used for non-disordered conditions that create significant problems in present-day society.'

'Oxidation of iron and manganese ions\xc2\xa0is predominant in the oxygen-rich deep western boundary current (DWBC) within the Pacific Ocean. By the faster removal of particulate iron hydroxide and manganese oxide, densities of the particulate matters are considered to be lower in the DWBC than the interior region. To detect the density variation of suspended particles between the DWBC and interior regions, we analyzed echo intensity (EI) measured in the western North Pacific by hydrographic casts with a 300\xc2\xa0kHz lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler (LADCP) in a whole water column. At depths greater than 3000\xc2\xa0m (~\xc2\xa03000\xc2\xa0dbar), EI is almost uniformly low between 12\xc2\xb0N and 30\xc2\xb0N but peaks sharply from 30\xc2\xb0N to 35\xc2\xb0N to a maximum north of 35\xc2\xb0N. EI is found to be anomalously low in the DWBC compared to the background distribution. The DWBC pathways are identifiable by the low EI and high dissolved oxygen concentration.

'This article investigates the difficulties in transplanting global legal norms into developing countries, specifically the problem of \xe2\x80\x99false friends.\xe2\x80\x99 This is a linguistics concept describing the situation where there is a striking resemblance between two words in two different languages, leading speakers of each language to assume, incorrectly, that they understand the word\xe2\x80\x99s meaning in the other language. Even more problematically, the misunderstanding is hidden by the assumption of understanding. We argue that similar problems can occur when there is a superficial similarity (but a fundamental mismatch) between particular global and local norms. We illustrate this through the example of global intellectual property regimes and their reception in Vanuatu and Mexico, showing how reforms are sometimes welcomed into developing countries on the basis of false assumptions that their aims are congruent with existing understandings. Finally, the paper develops some policy implications for avoiding the \xe2\x80\x98false friends\xe2\x80\x99 problem in a transnational legal context.\n'

'The Tallberg deposit is situated in the Skellefte District in northern Sweden. It is a Palaeoproterozoic equivalent of Phanerozoic poryphyry-type deposits. The mineralization is situated within the J\xc3\xb6rn granitoid complex and is associated with intrusive quartz-feldspar porphyries. The granitoids are coeval with mainly felsic volcanic rocks hosting several massive sulphide deposits. The alteration is generally of a mixed phyllic-propylitic type, but areas or zones associated with high gold grades exhibit phyllic alteration. Ore minerals are pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, magnetite, and trace amounts of molybdenite. In this stable isotope study, quartz, sericite, and chlorite from the alteration zones were sampled. The magmatic quartz has a \xe2\x88\x8218O composition of + 6.2 to +6.7\xe2\x80\xb0 whereas the quartz in the hydrothermal alteration zones have values ranging from +7.5 to +10.6\xe2\x80\xb0. The calculated temperatures for this fractionation range from 430\xc2\xb0 to 520\xc2\xb0C. The sericites have \xe2\x88\x8218O ranging from +4.6 to +8.2\xe2\x80\xb0 (average +6.6\xe2\x80\xb0) and \xe2\x88\x82D -31 to -54\xe2\x80\xb0 (average -41\xe2\x80\xb0). Chlorites range from \xe2\x88\x8218O +4.2 to +7.7\xe2\x80\xb0 and \xe2\x88\x82D from \xe2\x88\x9234 to \xe2\x88\x9244\xe2\x80\xb0. The range of \xe2\x88\x8234S of 11 pyrite samples is +3.8 to +5.5\xe2\x80\xb0 with an average of +4.6 \xc2\xb1 0.5\xe2\x80\xb0, suggesting a relatively homogeneous sulphur source, probably of magmatic origin. Modelling waters in equilibrium with the minerals indicates early magmatic fluids with \xe2\x88\x8218O of \xe2\x89\x88 6.5\xe2\x80\xb0. This fluid mixed with a low \xe2\x88\x8218O and high \xe2\x88\x82D fluid, which is tentatively identified as seawater. The \xe2\x88\x8218O signature of sericite and chlorite also indicates significant water-rock exchange, explaining the positive \xe2\x88\x8218O values for the waters in equilibrium with the hydrated minerals.'

'Zircon megacrysts (\xc2\xb1 gem corundum) appear in basalt fields of Indo-Pacific origin over a 12,000\xc2\xa0km zone (ZIP) along West Pacific continental margins. Age-dating, trace element, oxygen and hafnium isotope studies on representative zircons (East Australia\xe2\x80\x93Asia) indicate diverse magmatic sources. The U\xe2\x80\x93Pb (249 to 1\xc2\xa0Ma) and zircon fission track (ZFT) ages (65 to 1\xc2\xa0Ma) suggest thermal annealing during later basalt transport, with\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x891 to 203\xc2\xa0Ma gaps between the U\xe2\x80\x93Pb and ZFT ages. Magmatic growth zonation and Zr/Hf ratios (0.01\xe2\x80\x930.02) suggest alkaline magmatic sources, while Ti\xe2\x80\x94in\xe2\x80\x94zircon thermometry suggests that most zircons crystallized within ranges between 550 and 830\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C. Chondrite-normalised multi-element plots show variable enrichment patterns, mostly without marked Eu depletion, indicating little plagioclase fractionation in source melts. Key elements and ratios matched against zircons from magmatic rocks suggest a range of ultramafic to felsic source melts. Zircon O-isotope ratios (\xce\xb418O in the range 4 to 11\xe2\x80\xb0) and initial Hf isotope ratios (\xce\xb5Hf in the range +2 to +14) encompass ranges for both mantle and crustal melts. Calculated Depleted Mantle (TDM 0.03\xe2\x80\x930.56\xc2\xa0Ga) and Crustal Residence (0.20\xe2\x80\x931.02\xc2\xa0Ga) model ages suggest several mantle events, continental break-ups (Rodinia and Gondwana) and convergent margin collisions left imprints in the zircon source melts. East Australian ZIP sites reflect prolonged intraplate magmatism (~85\xc2\xa0Ma), often during times of fast-migrating lithosphere. In contrast, East Asian-Russian ZIP sites reflect later basaltic magmatism (<40\xc2\xa0Ma), often linked to episodes of back-arc rifting and spreading, slow-migrating lithosphere and slab subduction.'

'Trade agreements are increasingly recognised as playing an influential role in shaping national food environments and the availability and nutritional quality of the food supply. Global monitoring of food environments and trade policies can strengthen the evidence base for the impact of trade policy on nutrition, and support improved policy coherence. Using the INFORMAS trade monitoring protocol, we reviewed available food supply data to understand associations between Fiji\xe2\x80\x99s commitments under WTO trade agreements and food import volume trends.'

'Gm systems provide unique markers for the study of human genetics, especially for the characterization of a population, the study of gene flow, and genetic drift by the presence of a unique haplotype or by marked differences in the frequencies of identical haplotypes. It has been shown that Gm haplotypes commonly present among Mongoloids are Gmag, Gmaxg, Gmab3st, and Gmafb1b3.'

'The physical differences between major non-African ethnic, groups can be explained as admixture of migrating African modernHomo sapiens with existing archaicHomo populations. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA claiming no admixture is dismissed as there is no confidence in claimed phylogenies. Racial characteristics can be explained by linking present day non-African humans with sympatric archaic populations. Neanderthals are linked with Caucasians, the Solo population with Australian Aborigines and \xe2\x80\x98Peking Man\xe2\x80\x99 with modern Mongoloids. Fossil, geographic and anthropometric evidence for dihybrid origins are considered. As a result, Asiatic Negritos are hypothesized to be remnant groups of \xe2\x80\x98morphologically pure\xe2\x80\x99 migrating modern Africans. It is suggested that paleoanthropologists attempting to reconstruct human origins should consider the dihybrid theory as a plausible alternative to the irreconcilable \xe2\x80\x98complete replacement\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98multiregional\xe2\x80\x99 theories.'

'Sulawesi in Indonesia has a unique geographical profile with assumed separation from Sundaland. Studies of Helicobacter pylori in this region are rare due to the region\xe2\x80\x99s rural location and lack of endoscopy equipment. Indirect methods are, therefore, the most appropriate for measuring H. pylori infection in these areas; with the disposable gastric brush test, we can obtain gastric juice as well as small gastric tissue samples for H. pylori culture. We investigated the prevalence of H. pylori infection and evaluated human migration patterns in the remote areas of North Sulawesi.'

'The Ouv\xc3\xa9a Parakeet (Eunymphicus uvaeensis), endemic to Ouv\xc3\xa9a Island (Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, south-west Pacific), is a rainforest bird that is dependent on tree cavities for nesting. It is threatened by deforestation, but also by competition for nest sites with introduced bees, harvesting for pets, and potentially predation by introduced species. Despite these threats, we show that the Ouv\xc3\xa9a Parakeet population increased exponentially from an estimated 617 (274\xe2\x80\x93996) birds in 1993 to 2,090 (1,280\xe2\x80\x933,413) birds in 2009 (95% confidence interval). We explain this population increase by community-based protection measures that eliminated nest poaching. We recommend that these measures are maintained, remnant forest is protected, and the introduction of rats is prevented.'

'In an attempt to elucidate the origin of an isolated peripheral Highland, Papua New Guinea population (the Karimui), HLA, blood group and serum protein markers were investigated. Due to the paucity of published HLA marker data, genetic distances using non-HLA markers were constructed between populations surrounding the Karimui and compared in 3-dimensions by multidimensional scaling analysis. Genetically, the Karimui is most closely associated with Highland populations to the east and northeast.'

'The following article argues that water was the critical nexus between the human and non-human world of wartime Guadalcanal in 1942 and central to how infantry experienced campaigning in the South Pacific. Content of this paper divides into five briefs: part one follows the misery generated for young infantry by heavy rainfall and saturating humidity. Part two outlines the role of water in mosquito breeding, which produced a medical crisis for the 1st Marine Division. Part three discusses the \xe2\x80\x98static river\xe2\x80\x99, or the militarized river, referring to rivers that acted as perimeters and hosted the frontline of combat. Part four examines how murky water was treated to provide safe drinking water, avoiding a potential crisis. Part five discusses the \xe2\x80\x98moving river\xe2\x80\x99, a place where territorial crocodiles directly impacted the lives of young infantry. The source base for this article is a hybrid of military archival documents, personal correspondence with veterans, and supporting secondary historical and scientific sources. As the base element of life itself, water is both self-evident and yet often invisible due to its overwhelmingly central position in our lives. To aid in determining the effects and role of the non-human world on human actions during warfare, water makes sense as an examining tool. The U.S. 1st Marine Division provides a manageable case study in which to ascertain the role of environmental adversity in total war. Ultimately, as simple and as complex as the water-nexus is, it was absolutely central to how infantry and units experienced and conducted warfare at one of the most important turning-point campaigns in WWII.'

'Following civil war, (re)establishing operational, legitimate and accessible justice systems for resolving disputes is touted as critical for sustainable peace. While rule of law programming has gained significant traction as the favoured solution internationally, questions remain as to what approach such programming should take, and how complex dynamics in societies emerging from civil war affect local populations trying to access justice, particularly in legally plural settings. This article sheds light on these questions by examining a case study of a programme that took an alternative approach to the \xe2\x80\x98rule of law orthodoxy\xe2\x80\x99. The programme, known as PEACE Foundation Melanesia, engaged with customary justice systems in post-conflict Bougainville, and took into account some of the contextual realities faced by local populations. In particular, the material presented in this study\xe2\x80\x94drawn from 42 interviews\xe2\x80\x94shows how post-conflict insecurity, and related concerns about related psychological ill-health and cycles of retaliation played a significant part in preferences, experiences, and impact of the programme for local populations.'

'In recent years, phylogeographic studies have produced detailed knowledge on the worldwide distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants, linking specific clades of the mtDNA phylogeny with certain geographic areas. However, a multiplex genotyping system for the detection of the mtDNA haplogroups of major continental distribution that would be desirable for efficient DNA-based bio-geographic ancestry testing in various applications is still missing.'

'Little is published on risk factors associated with bovine brucellosis in Pacific island communities. The 2009 re-emergence of bovine brucellosis in Fiji enabled us to do an interview-based questionnaire survey of 81 farms in the Wainivesi locality of the Tailevu province on the main island of Fiji to investigate what risk factors could have played a role in the re-emergence of the disease. The survey was conducted on 68 farms that had no positive cases of bovine brucellosis and on 13 farms in the same area where cattle had returned a positive result to the Brucella Rose Bengal test. Descriptive statistical methods were used to describe the demographic data while univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between the selected risk factors and the presence of brucellosis on the farms at the time of the outbreak. The demographics of Fijian dairy farms are presented in the article and the biosecurity implications of those farming systems are discussed. Two risk factors were strongly associated with farms having brucellosis, and these were history of reactor cattle to brucellosis and or bovine tuberculosis on the farm (OR\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa029, P\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa00.01) and farms that practised sharing of water sources for cattle within and with outside farms (OR\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa039, P\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa00.01). Possible reasons why these were risk factors are also discussed. The potential risks for human health was also high as the use of personal protective equipment was low (15%). A high proportion of farmers (62%) could not recognise brucellosis thus contributing to the low frequency of disease reports (44%) made. The article also highlights other important risk factors which could be attributed to farming practices in the region and which could contribute to public health risks and the re-emergence of diseases.'

'Mooring observations were conducted from July 16, 2011 to March 30, 2012 east of Mindanao, Philippines (127\xc2\xb02.8\xe2\x80\xb2E, 8\xc2\xb00.3\xe2\x80\xb2N) to observe the abyssal current at about 5 600 m deep and 500 m above the ocean bottom. Several features were revealed: 1) the observed abyssal current was highly variable with standard deviations of 57.3 mm/s and 34.0 mm/s, larger than the mean values of -31.9 and 16.6 mm/s for the zonal and meridional components, respectively; 2) low-frequency current longer than 6 days exhibited strong seasonal variation, flowing southeastward (mean flow direction of 119.0\xc2\xb0 clockwise from north) before about October 1, 2011 and northwestward (mean flow direction of 60.5\xc2\xb0 counter-clockwise from north) thereafter; 3) the high-frequency flow bands were dominated by tidal currents O1, K1, M2, and S2, and near-inertial currents, whose frequencies were higher than the local inertial frequency. The two diurnal tidal constituents were much stronger than the two semidiurnal ones. This study provides for the first time an observational insight into the abyssal western boundary current east of Mindanao based on long-term observations at one site. It is meaningful for further research into the deep and abyssal circulation over the whole Philippine Sea and the 3D structure of the western boundary current system in this region. More observational and high-resolution model studies are needed to examine the spatial structure and temporal variation of the abyssal current over a much larger space and longer period, their relation to the upper-layer circulation, and the underlying dynamics.'

'Accretionary orogens are the sites of long-lived convergent margin tectonics, both compressional and extensional. They are also the hosts to the majority of the world\xe2\x80\x99s important gold deposits. A very diverse range of deposit types occurs within accretionary orogens, commonly in close proximity in space and time to each other. These include porphyry and associated high-sulphidation Au\xe2\x80\x93Cu\xe2\x80\x93Ag deposits, classic low-sulphidation Au\xe2\x80\x93Ag deposits, low-sulphidation Au deposits centred on alkalic intrusive complexes, Carlin-type Au deposits, Au-rich volcanic-hosted massive sulphide deposits, orogenic Au deposits, intrusion-related Au deposits and iron oxide Cu\xe2\x80\x93Au deposits. Empirical patterns of spatial distribution of these deposits suggest there must be fundamental generic controls on gold metallogeny. Various lines of evidence lead to the proposal that the underlying key generic factor controlling accretionary orogen gold metallogeny is regional-scale, long-term, pre- and syn-subduction heterogeneous fertilisation of the lithospheric mantle that becomes a source of mineralisation-associated arc magma or hydrothermal fluid components. This process provides a gold-enriched reservoir that can be accessed later in a diverse range of tectonomagmatic settings. Based on this concept, a unified model is proposed in which the formation of a major gold deposit of any type requires the conjunction in time and space of three essential factors: a fertile upper-mantle source region, a favourable transient remobilisation event, and favourable lithospheric-scale plumbing structure. This framework provides the basis for a practical regional-scale targeting methodology that is applicable to data-poor regions.'

'The nearly latitudinal giant fracture zones in the northeastern Pacific Ocean are accompanied by narrow fault-line uplifts making up tectonic couples that strike for thousands of kilometers. They are especially distinctly expressed in the gravity map of the World Ocean [7]. As is shown in the paper, a compensation mechanism of deep mass displacement operates in the uplift-deepwater trench system. The uplifts have similar asymmetric structures, which reflects the long-term unidirectional effect of the deep geodynamic stress. In my opinion, the system of the fault-line uplifts began to form at the Cretaceous-Cenozoic boundary.'

'Papua New Guinea is a developing country which gained its independence from Australia in 1975. Many of its educational structures inherited from the time of the early missions and the colonial administration influence the practices of today. Women have not advanced in the new country as far as was prophesied in the early 1970s leading up to Independence. Although the current poor economic conditions have some effect on women\'s advancement, the difficulties they face in even obtaining a basic education form one of the major factors which hinder their progress. This paper describes a number of the barriers which prevent girls from accessing education at every level, from gaining enrolment in the first year of school to positioning themselves for university entry. Distance education provides one of the few "second chances" that young Papua New Guineans can gain, provided they can afford the fees and engage with the somewhat independent study required for success.'

'Humans live in modular societies with a minimum of two levels of organization, the conjugal family and the local community. Yet any human community is likely to contain at least one other social unit whose evolutionary significance has not always been recognized: a same-sex association, such as a men\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclub\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbrotherhood.\xe2\x80\x9d The purpose of this article is to explore the role of all-male associations in relation to the conjugal families that are often taken to be the main constituents of human groups. What has been called bachelor threat in other mammalian species is a major problem in human societies, which may include follower males as well as all-male units. Yet tensions between married men and bachelors are often eclipsed by the need for warriors to defend the local community. The ethnographic record includes many cases in which fraternal security takes precedence over conjugal bonds, resulting in the physical segregation of the sexes, including husbands and wives. At the extreme, a husband usually sleeps at a men\xe2\x80\x99s house while making regular visits to his conjugal family. Though this pattern is classically associated with tribal Amazonia and Melanesia, it is seen here as part of a continuum of variation in small-scale societies worldwide. These societies reflect a series of historical compromises, it is argued, between bachelors and elders, on the one hand, and between men\xe2\x80\x99s associations and conjugal families, on the other.'

'This is a description of species area effects for Agromyzidae associated with leguminous plants. The data on geographic area was extracted from the National Museums of Kenya (Herbarium section). The geographic area species plots showed an effective partial correlation of 16%. The correlation was unfortunately low and could be attributed to inadequate botanical and agromyzid records in Kenya. Generally, geographical area explained most of the species richness in Kenya. Other variations not accounted for by the logarithmic plot of species-area effects were derived from residuals. The plots between residuals and different variables showed that leaf-form, habitat variation, altitude and taxonomic isolation also explained variation in species area plots.'

"The available information on the world distribution of Huntington's disease (HD) from population surveys and death rate analysis is summarised and discussed in the light of genetic studies. It is concluded that most European populations, both Northern and Southern, show a relatively high prevalence (4\xe2\x80\x938 per 100,000), and that the disorder may also be frequent in India and parts of central Asia. HD is notably rare in Finland and in Japan, but data for Eastern Asia and Africa are inadequate. The disorder may have been underestimated in the American black population. Populations derived from recent European imigration show frequencies and origins of HD comparable to those expected from their own origins and expansion; there is no evidence to suggest that the HD gene has spread disproportionally and its selective effect may be close to neutral. Multiple separate introductions of the gene have been the rule in large populations. Several major foci of HD exist as the result of rapid population expansion. It is likely that a number of separate mutations for HD will be shown to be responsible for the disease, but that the high frequency of HD in European populations will prove to be the result of one or a very small number of mutations, probably of great antiquity."

'The Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) Partnership, developed and managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG Kew), conserves propagules primarily from orthodox seed-bearing wild vascular plants. It is the largest ex situ conservation programme in the world, currently involving 96 countries and territories. Where possible, seeds are collected and conserved in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to RBG Kew\xe2\x80\x99s MSB for storage. In this paper we assess the conservation value of the germplasm stored at the MSB using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The MSB holdings represent a high quality, rich biological resource. Substantial and unique taxonomic diversity exists amongst the collections, representing 365 families, 5813 genera, 36,975 species and 39,669 taxa conserved. The collections cover a wide geographic range, originating from 189 countries and territories, representing all nine bio-geographic regions and all 35 biodiversity hotspots. The collections possess significant natural capital and population value: 32% of taxa, representing 49% of collections, have at least one identified use to humans; and 74% of taxa, representing 78% of collections, are either endemic, endangered (nationally or globally) and/or have an economic, ecological, social, cultural or scientific value. While 10% of taxa, representing >\xc2\xa08% of collections, are either extinct, rare or vulnerable to extinction at the global and/or national level, 20% of taxa, representing 13% collections, are endemic at the country or territory scale. Over the 17-year period since 2000 at least 11,182 seed samples, representing 12% of taxa and 8% of collections, have been distributed globally for conservation, research, education and display. This analysis highlighted collection gaps in MSB holdings in relation to their geographic representativeness, the taxonomic diversity of large families and genera of angiosperms, and coverage of threatened taxa. Further analysis across the entire MSB Partnership is required to underpin future collection activities and maximize the usefulness of collections.'

'Alma Espino and Yvonne Underhill-Sem discuss the issue of regionalism and regionalization in Latin America and in the Pacific. Although there are important differences between these realities, they highlight advantages, dangers and challenges of economic integration for gender and social equity focusing on the power relations operating at various levels. They emphasize the need to improve knowledge about the gender dimension of these processes. Understanding the gendered implications of the geographic expansion of global capitalism will allow feminists to build proposals of economic integration schemes that are more comprehensive, gender-aware and oriented to human development.'

'The prevalence of diabetes varies enormously between different countries and different racial groups, from virtually nil to 30 % of a community affected. This variation is largely controlled by environmental factors, most clearly related to famine or feasting, but intrinsic genetic \xc2\xabracial\xc2\xbb influences cannot be discounted. Types of diabetes and their relative frequency also differ among different peoples, and although all groups are liable to specific diabetic vascular disease, some are virtually completely spared coronary artery disease.'

'To study food production systems of six communities located on six different islands of Vanuatu we selected villages in zones of low and high population pressures. We measured land availability, soil fertility, genetic resources, average yields of food gardens, their plant densities, traditional knowledge richness (TKR), and household incomes and expenses. We analyzed a total of 224 plots belonging to 30 farmers and identified 13 root crop species with the total number of cultivars in communities ranging from 74 to 261. Surprisingly, villages under high population pressure have shorter fallow periods but higher yields. In both zones, women have higher TKR. In high population pressure villages there are signs of soil fertility reduction and mineral depletion but no signs of significant decrease in soil fertility after the first year of cultivation, indicating that root crop species remove limited amounts of total N and minerals per year. The purchase of imported foods is associated with a sociocultural change in diets rather than pressures on land or soils. Our quantitative and integrative methodology allows clear differentiation between villages under different pressures and can be used to assess levels of resilience and vulnerability.'

"From 1960 onwards the U.S. Government set out to improve the schools in American Samoa. During the period 1971\xe2\x80\x9375 educational leaders there carried out a series of studies of the islanders' educational needs in order to assess the suitability of existing learning goals and the degree to which they were being achieved. Approaches used were a community-opinion survey, a classroom-problems survey, an evaluation of the school system's specific instructional objectives, a program of standarized testing, a bi-lingual testing of academic achievement, a physical performance testing programme and a system of teacher-parent conferences and ratings of pupils progress. Ten critical unmet needs were identified: better command of English; greater mastery of Samoan language and culture; better opportunities to learn according to the pupil's individual abilities and background; better command of mathematics; increased vocational-education opportunities; improved physical-education skills; better command of social sciences; better command of health and science knowledge; more consistent school attendance, and better social skills. These needs were investigated in detail so that specific steps might be planned to fulfil them. The teacher/parent conferencing program, based on a Californian model, was a failure."

'The incidence of malignant lymphomas in Japan is relatively low compared to that in western European countries and the United States. However, in limited areas in Japan a specific type of lymphoid malignancy called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), which is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), is highly prevalent, and there are also many healthy carriers of HTLV-I in the same areas. A cross-sectional seroepidemiological study of HTLV-I showed that the age-specific proportion of healthy HTLV-I carriers in these ATL-endemic areas increased with age, especially over 40, and was higher in females than in males. Three main routes of HTLV-I transmission are recognized: 1) vertical transmission from mother to child mainly through breast milk; 2) horizontal transmission from man to woman through semen, and; 3) parenteral transmission from carrier donor to non-carrier recipient. The annual incidence rate of ATL among HTLV-I carriers is estimated at 2.0 in males and 0.5 in females, and the cumulative risk for ATL in HTLV-I carriers during a 70-year life span is 1%\xe2\x80\x935%. Possible risk factors for ATL in addition to HTLV-I infection were considered, i.e. genetic factors, environmental factors, nutritional condition, thymus involution etc., but none of these were found to be clearly associated with ATL. To determine whether there exist particularly susceptible hosts for ATL in the ATL endemic areas, HLA types were examined, but no conclusive results on the positive relationships between HLA types and ATL manifestation or HTLV-I infection were obtained. From follow-up studies on the age-specific distribution of HTLV-I carriers in Japan, it is now speculated that the HTLV-I infection rate might have decreased naturally in the more recent generational cohort groups, even in the ATL-endemic areas. However, ATL in Japan is an important subject for study in the field of cancer epidemiology, and several trial intervention programs for the prevention of ATL, such as controls of vertical transmission from mother to child through breast milk, are now ongoing in the ATL-endemic areas of Japan.'

'This review concerns issues related to the evolutionary and genetic origins of hypertensive disease. An evolutionary approach is used to account for the predisposition of modern people to the development of a pathology such as hypertensive disease.

'Koro, a disorder characterized by complaints of genital hyperinvolution and fear of impending death, is found to be indigenous to certain populations of insular Southeast Asia. Koro is similar to, but nevertheless distinct from, the Chinese syndrome which carries its name and serves as the transcultural prototype; the category of genital retraction syndromes is proposed as a substitute for the use of \xe2\x80\x9ckoro\xc2\xbb as the transcultural rubric. In a review of the Koro literature, an exploration of the many possible cultural and biomedical factors is begun; the issues and perspectives are relevant to the wider study of culture speck manifestations of genital retraction.'

'Ancestry is the series of ancestors who form a line of descent or lineage back to an arbitrary founder or founding population. In recent years, integration of genome-wide genotype and sequence data from multiple populations worldwide has provided much insight into the identities and distributions of ancestral populations or clusters, thereby improving our understanding of historical migrations and current population structure at a sub-continental or regional level. Genetic ancestry, distinct from self-reported ancestry or ethnicity, serves both as a confounder in genetic association studies of genotypes and as a predictor in admixture mapping studies. This review focuses on the impact of genetic ancestry on transferability of genetic loci conferring disease risk.'

'To clarify the global deep-water circulation in the northwest Pacific, we conducted current observations with seven moorings at 40\xc2\xb0N east of Japan from May 2007 to October 2008, together with hydrographic observations. By analyzing the data, while taking into consideration that the deep circulation has a northward component in this region and carries low-silica, high-dissolved-oxygen water, we clarified that the deep circulation flows within the region between 144\xc2\xb030\xe2\x80\xb2 and 146\xc2\xb010\xe2\x80\xb2E at 40\xc2\xb0N on and east of the eastern slope of the Japan Trench with marked variability; the deep circulation flows partly on the eastern slope of the trench and mainly to the east during P1 (10 May\xe2\x80\x9324 November 2007), is confined to the eastern slope of the trench during P2 (25 November 2007\xe2\x80\x9320 May 2008), and flows on and to the immediate east of the eastern slope of the trench during P3 (21 May\xe2\x80\x9315 October 2008). Previous studies have identified two branches of the deep circulation at lower latitudes in the western North Pacific; one flows off the western trenches and the other detours near the Shatsky Rise. It was thus concluded that the eastern branch flows westward at 38\xc2\xb0N and then northward to the east of the trench, finally joining the western branch around 40\xc2\xb0N during P1 and P3, whereas the eastern branch passes westward south of 38\xc2\xb0N, joins the western branch around 38\xc2\xb0N, and flows northward on the eastern slope of the trench during P2.'

'Several lines of evidence have confirmed the importance of Nod2 mutations for disease susceptibility in Crohn\xe2\x80\x99s disease. For tracing Nod2 evolution, exons 4a, 4e, 8, and 12 mutations were screened in a collection of 1,064 DNA samples from 52 worldwide populations. The overall allele frequency was 7.5% for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)5, 0.2% for SNP8, 0.3% for SNP12, and 0.4% for SNP13. Nod2 mutations are mainly Caucasian alleles with strong distribution dissimilarity between single populations and major geographical regions. This regional diversity of Nod2 mutations within Europe points to the regional existence of selection pressure (possibly through dairy-associated bacterial infections within Neolithic cattle farming populations). The SNP5 gradient between Africa and the Middle East and its absence in Asian and Native American populations indicate that the evolution of this variant occurred in the Middle East. As mutations in exons 4e, 8, and 12 were only found in association with SNP5, this variant may have allowed selection pressure to arise.'

' The populations that colonized Siberia diverged from one another in the Paleolithic and evolved in isolation until today. These populations are therefore a rich source of information about the conditions under which the initial divergence of modern humans occurred. In the present study we used the HLA system, first, to investigate the evolution of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) itself, and second, to reveal the relationships among Siberian populations. We determined allelic frequencies at five HLA class II loci (DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1) in seven Siberian populations (Ket, Evenk, Koryak, Chukchi, Nivkh, Udege, and Siberian Eskimo) by the combination of single-stranded conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis. We then used the gene frequency data to deduce the HLA class II haplotypes and their frequencies. Despite high polymorphism at four of the five loci, no new alleles could be detected. This finding is consistent with a conserved evolution of human class II MHC genes. We found a high number of HLA class II haplotypes in Siberian populations. More haplotypes have been found in Siberia than in any other population. Some of the haplotypes are shared with non-Siberian populations, but most of them are new, and some represent \xe2\x80\x9cforbidden\xe2\x80\x9d combinations of DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. We suggest that a set of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d haplotypes was brought to Siberia with the colonizers but that most of the new haplotypes were generated in Siberia by recombination and are part of a haplotype pool that is turning over rapidly. The allelic frequencies at the DRB1 locus divide the Siberian populations into eastern and central Siberian branches; only the former shows a clear genealogical relationship to Amerinds.'

'Given the heavy reliance placed on and investment in protected areas for biological conservation, there has been much debate as to how effective these are in representing biodiversity features within their boundaries. The majority of studies addressing this issue have been conducted on a regional or national basis, precluding a broad picture of patterns of representation at the species level. We present a global assessment of the representation of the terrestrial geographic ranges of complete taxonomic groups: all known extant amphibians, birds and mammals (20,736 species) within the current global system of protected areas. We conclude that it is necessary substantially to improve the levels of coverage of the geographic ranges of the majority of species, even the widespread ones. This is particularly true for rare species, which might be assumed to be foci for protected area systems. To improve on the low levels of coverage of vertebrate ranges attained by the existing areas, key regions should be targeted, but heavy reliance will also have to be placed on approaches to sustaining populations in the wider, unprotected landscape.'

'Retracing the genetic histories of the descendant populations of the Slave Trade (16th-19th centuries) is particularly challenging due to the diversity of African ethnic groups involved and the different hybridisation processes with Europeans and Amerindians, which have blurred their original genetic inheritances. The Noir Marron in French Guiana are the direct descendants of maroons who escaped from Dutch plantations in the current day Surinam. They represent an original ethnic group with a highly blended culture. Uniparental markers (mtDNA and NRY) coupled with HTLV-1 sequences (env and LTR) were studied to establish the genetic relationships linking them to African American and African populations.'

'Using the example of the Catholic Church in Papua New Guinea (PNG), I detail how, through praxis, it has brought to life a living theology of HIV and AIDS. In this way, the Catholic Church in PNG is responding faithfully to the epidemic. As a Christian country with a generalised HIV epidemic, where the body of an individual is reconstituted through the liturgical practices of baptism and Eucharist, theologically, in PNG the body of Christ has AIDS. In order to examine the ways in which the Catholic Church in PNG has responded faithfully to the Christian body with AIDS, I do so in relation to the three theological virtues of faith, hope and love.'

'Sediment core samples were collected from Hiroshima Bay in the Seto Inland Sea, western Northwest Pacific Ocean, and their 239+240Pu activities and 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios were determined by sector field ICP-MS. The activities of 239+240Pu ranged from 0.556\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.025 to 0.745\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.023\xc2\xa0mBq/g. The atom ratios of 240Pu/239Pu were almost constant within the whole depth; the average value was 0.227\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.014. This atom ratio was significantly higher than the mean global fallout ratio of 0.18, proving the presence of close-in fallout Pu that originated from the Pacific Proving Ground (PPG). The water masses exchanges between the Kuroshio Current and the Seto Inland Sea brought the PPG source Pu to this area, then Pu was extensively scavenged into sediment particles supplied by the rivers around the bay. The relative contributions of the global fallout Pu and the PPG close-in fallout Pu were evaluated by the two end-member mixing model. The contribution of the PPG close-in fallout was 38\xe2\x80\x9341% of the total Pu in sediment. The remaining 59\xe2\x80\x9362% was attributed to direct global fallout and the land-origin Pu transported by the rivers around the Hiroshima Bay.'

'Lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti is present at high prevalence in some parts of Papua New Guinea.

The LF programme has been daunted by the scope of the problem, and progress on mass drug administration (MDA) has been slow and lacking in resources.'

'Urban agriculture is receiving increasing attention throughout the developing world, but debate rages as to whether it is a blessing or a curse. Some see it as savior for the poor, providing food, and livelihoods, yet to others it is responsible for harboring and vectoring pathogenic diseases and is an archaic practice that has no place along the path toward development. Consequently, the activity receives a mixed reception, and despite much support in many instances, it certainly does not enjoy universal unimpeded progress. Here, we undertake a global tour of urban agriculture throughout the developing world in an attempt to elucidate the various benefits, costs, and hindrances associated with the practice. Through this analysis we identify the need for better understanding of the following six aspects if urban agriculture is to make a meaningful contribution to food security and sustenance of livelihoods in the future: (1) the global and regional extent of urban agriculture; (2) the contribution of urban agriculture to communicable diseases, especially malaria but also diarrheal disease; (3) the role that urban agriculture does and/or could play in abating both malnutrition and obesity; (4) the impacts of urban agriculture on women; (5) appropriate methods of achieving governance and institutional support; and (6) the risks posed by chemical pollutants, particularly as Africa becomes increasingly industrialized. Overlaying these, we suggest that the time is ripe to extend the debate about urban agriculture\xe2\x80\x99s positive and negative environmental impacts\xe2\x80\x94especially in relation to carbon emissions\xe2\x80\x94from primarily a developed world concern to the developing world, particularly since it is the developing world where population growth and consequent resource use is increasing most rapidly.'

'The particularities of history, culture, economy and politics of Papua New Guinea and similar Pacific island and other developing nations place strains upon the formulation and implementation of reform in the financing of higher education (and of education in general). There has been progress in reducing unit costs, with favourable implications for the rate-of-return that links higher educational costs and benefits. Funding constraints continue to elicit calls for reform of higher educational financing and for increased student contributions. Failure to communicate human capital analysis and policy implications for improving efficiency, access, and equity in higher education have hindered reform. The analysis focuses on policy implementation of reform in the financing of higher education in Papua New Guinea, and concludes in favour of a shift in financing away from institutions and toward students.'

'This paper describes an indigenous hunting/fishing/trapping economy in the Taimyr Autonomous Region, northern Russia, and traces the continuities and developments in property since the collapse of the Soviet command economy in 1991. Indigenous relations to hunting grounds and renewable resources are discussed with ethnographic case material from Dolgan and Nganasan communities. Land tenure is analyzed in terms of inclusive and exclusive property and informal and formal resource management. The asymmetric growth and distribution of common-pool territories and private holdings is a central issue. A number of factors when examined together appear to favor common property and traditional management including ancestral frames of morality and access, crosscutting kin relationships, principles of ownership and mutual aid, cooperative hunting, sharing of meat and fish, as well as migration patterns of prey species and relative increases in the cost of freight transport since 1991. In addition, private holdings often make commercial sales and generally have better access to urban centers, while they are more closely regulated through land, tax, and environment offices of local government.'

Also, to document the policy process, identify barriers and facilitators during implementation and to examine the impact of the new import duty on import volumes.'

"The environmental impacts created by recreational visitors to the wet-dry tropics of Western Australia raise questions about the type of visitor and the capacity of remote areas to 'carry\xe2\x80\x99 increasing numbers of visitors. This paper looks at those questions in regard to some of the more remote natural attractions in the tropical North Kimberley region. Three locations\xe2\x80\x94Cape Domett at the mouth of the Ord River, the Admiralty Gulf and the Mitchell Plateau\xe2\x80\x94illustrate the differences between attractions, visitors, patterns of visitor behavior and their impacts on the local environment. As the highly variable nature of the Australian wet-tropics renders the use of conventional site indicators of carrying capacity difficult, an ecological alternative is proposed for research. The dominance of local and other Australian four-wheel drivers to the Kimberley and the impacts they create are shown to challenge the government's promotion of the region to overseas visitors and its notion of tourism as a sustainable industry."

'Pb, Cd, and Ni contents were determined in the scalp hair of the Asmat of Irian Jaya (Indonesian New Guinea) on 35 adult subjects. These data are presented together with those of Al, Ca, Ti, Fe, Cu, Zn and Sr, which were determined in previous research on the same group. Hair samples were analyzed by EDXRS and ICP. Trace elements were also determined in 12 soil samples from the same area by EDXRS (Al, Si, K, Ca, Fe) and ICP (Cu, Sr, Ti), and by AAS (Cd, Ni, Pb). When hair element levels are compared and discussed with those of other New Guinea populations, acculturated and nonacculturated tropical groups, populations from Western countries and from polluted areas, and \xe2\x80\x9crecommended levels\xe2\x80\x9d in the literature, they greatly exceed Western levels and generally fit those of other New Guinea populations, stressing the importance of common environment, subsistence, and behavior. The results of soil analyses are consistent with the presence of those elements in hair, and their quantitative distribution follows a common trend. Metal mobility in soil, patterns of absorption, and transfer from soil to plants and to humans are considered here.'

'The classification of the genusFicus has changed considerably in the course of time and is still the subject of further research and discussion. The main subdivisions in the most recent classification by Corner12 are presented together with the genera of pollinating fig wasps (Agaonidae) associated with them. These subdivisions are discussed and grouped according to morphological and functional traits, in particular in connection with the unique pollination system. Two main groups are recognized: one with only monoecious species and the other with predominantly (gyno)dioecious species. The former comprises two subgroups (Pharmacosycea andUrostigma) and the latter three, more profoundly different subgroups (Ficus, Sycidium andSycomorus). The neotropical representatives of the genus are discussed in somewhat more detail. In addition, the distribution of the genus is summarized for the three main regions of distribution; Africa, America, and Asia-Australasia. Finally the concordance between subdivisions ofFicus and those of the Agaonidae is briefly discussed.'

"A debate has arisen regarding the validity of racial/ethnic categories for biomedical and genetic research. Some claim 'no biological basis for race' while others advocate a 'race-neutral' approach, using genetic clustering rather than self-identified ethnicity for human genetic categorization. We provide an epidemiologic perspective on the issue of human categorization in biomedical and genetic research that strongly supports the continued use of self-identified race and ethnicity."

'Gold-rich Fe\xe2\x80\x93Cu\xe2\x80\x93Zn volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits occur within strata of probable Jurassic age on Rapu Rapu Island in Albay Province, Philippines. Massive sulfides at the Ungay Malobago and Hixbar deposits are spatially associated with dacitic volcanic rocks within a highly-deformed sequence of mafic volcanic and quartzofeldspathic sedimentary rocks. The massive sulfide deposits formed at the stratigraphic contact between footwall dacites and hangingwall mafic volcanic and quartzofeldspathic rocks. The deposits and their host strata have undergone regional metamorphism with strong penetrative deformation. Metamorphic mineral assemblages and textural evidence suggest that peak metamorphism was upper-greenschist to lower-amphibolite grade and syn-D1 deformation. Based on the age of regional metamorphism, deformation is inferred to be mid-Tertiary in age. Deformation at Rapu Rapu resulted in reorientation of the strata into a broad antiform with strong shallow-plunging elongation fabrics, overturning of the volcanic sequence that hosts the Ungay Malobago deposit, and complex folding of the mineralized zones. The present highly linear form of the Ungay Malobago deposit is mainly a product of this ductile strain.'

'\nGrowing concerns about pressures of global change on small-scale fishing communities have resulted in a proliferation of livelihood diversification initiatives linked to tourism. Where the focus is often on the role of financial, physical, and human capital in influencing the uptake of new opportunities, we argue for more consideration of the role of social capital. We implemented 157 household-level surveys in small-scale fishing communities in Papua New Guinea and modelled the influence of social and other capital assets on people\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of how easy it would be to become involved in sportfishing tourism. Social capital had a stronger influence relative to other forms of capital, with perceptions of reciprocity and satisfaction with leadership being the most influential aspects. Based on these results, we stress the importance of developing strategies aimed at understanding, building, and maintaining social capital and related social dynamics when implementing livelihood diversification initiatives.'

'The recent spate of comparative studies of crime is long overdue as a potential palliative to the traditional ethnocentrism of American criminology. But their comparative method is uncritically taken from two incompatible propositions derived from Durkheimian empiricism. As such, the generalizations about criminal behavior that these studies advance should be treated more with caution than optimism. This essay discusses the alleged advances over Durkheimian empiricism made by two distinct forms of cultural relativism.'

'Taro (Colocasia esculenta) and the greater yam (Dioscorea alata) are staples in Vanuatu. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of somaclonal variations in the varietal diversification of these two clonally propagated crops. The study was conducted in six villages located each on distinct islands of Vanuatu, Melanesia. Overall, 203 varieties of taro and 80 varieties of yam were collected and DArTs were used for analysis. The overall quality of the DArT markers was high for both species. The percentage of polymorphic clones detected on the DArT array was low for taro (3\xc2\xa0%) and high (13\xc2\xa0%) for yam, with respectively 202 and 499 polymorphic clones. Each variety was characterized by its multilocus genotype based on its DArT presence/absence profile. For taro, the 203 varieties were represented by 126 unique genotypes and 34 distinct multilocus lineages (MLLs). The high number of unique genotypes and the presence of few varieties sharing a clonal origin, generated a high varietal richness index (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.83). For yam, the 80 varieties were represented by seven unique genotypes and 16 MLLs. The low number of unique genotypes and the presence of numerous varieties sharing a clonal origin generated a low varietal richness index (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.26). Possible factors contributing to these contrasting results are discussed. DArT markers provide evidence that somaclonal variants of taro and yam are selected as new varieties. Strategies aiming at strengthening communities\xe2\x80\x99 capacity to adapt to forthcoming changes should consider the introduction of allelic diversity into farmers\xe2\x80\x99 varietal portfolios.'

'Understanding the role of inheritance in individual variation in drug response is the focus of pharmacogenetics (PGx). A key part of this understanding is quantifying the role of genetic ancestry in this phenotypic outcome. To provide insight into the relationship between ethnicity and drug response, this study first infers the global distribution of PGx variation and defines its structure. Second, the study evaluates if geographic population structure stems from all PGx loci in general, or if structure is caused by specific genes. Lastly, we identify the genetic variants contributing the greatest proportion of such structure. Our study describes the global genetic structure of PGx loci across the 52 populations of the Human Genome Diversity Cell-Line Panel, the most inclusive set of human populations freely available for studies on human genetic variation. By analysing genetic variation at 1,001 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in biotransformation of exogenous substances, we describe the between-populations PGx variation, as well geographical groupings of diversity. In addition, with discriminant analysis of principal component (DAPC), we infer how many and which groups of populations are supported by PGx variation, and identify which SNPs actually contribute to the PGx structure between such groups. Our results show that intergenic, synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs show similar levels of genetic variation across the globe. Conversely, loci coding for Cytochrome P450s (mainly metabolizing exogenous substances) show significantly higher levels of genetic diversity between populations than the other gene categories. Overall, genetic variation at PGx loci correlates with geographic distances between populations, and the apportionment of genetic variation is similar to that observed for the rest of the genome. In other words, the pattern of PGx variation has been mainly shaped by the demographic history of our species, as in the case of most of our genes. The population structure defined by PGx loci supports the presence of six genetic clusters reflecting geographic location of samples. In particular, the results of the DAPC analyses show that 27 SNPs substantially contribute to the first three discriminant functions. Among these SNPs, some, such as the intronic rs1403527 of NR1I2 and the non-synonymous rs699 of AGT, are known to be associated with specific drug responses. Their substantial variation between different groups of populations may have important implications for PGx practical applications.'

'High-K calc-alkaline rocks from Cape Nelson, eastern Papua are dominated by andesites containing numerous basic inclusions. High-Al basalts and dacites are subordinate. The slight iron enrichment and a systematic variation in K2O/SiO2 correlation observed in these rocks suggests a relationship to nearby rocks of a shoshonite association. The chemical composition of the inclusions illustrates the trends of major and minor element evolution which contradict the idea of complimentariness of high-K calc-alkaline rocks and alpine ultramafic rocks. The chemical character of the lavas (high K, Rb and Ba as well as high Cr and Ni) can be explained by fractional melting involving a mica phase.'

"Yvonne Underhill-Sem looks at how the markings of women's bodies speak of conflicting rationalities in global discourses, particularly those embedded in family groups and those in the nation-state.

"For the most part of the nineteenth century, the relation between romance and imperialism was symbiotic: imperial expansion provided new sites and material for literary romances. Nevertheless, as the rationalizing processes that eradicated adventure at home began reaching remote corners of the world, imperialism suddenly became the enemy of romance. This study attempts to reassess Henri Fauconnier's Malaisie (1930), a novel that was canonized at the time of its publication for its literary mission to re-evaluate colonial realities. To a certain extent Fauconnier's narrative does articulate a model of romance that exposed the absurdity and vanity of political engagement and the superiority of spiritual to imperial vocations. However, while Malaisie may have represented the Other space as testing ground for self-illumination and spiritual re-awakening my reading exposes the complexities and ambiguities that characterize literary geographies of adventure."

'The tectonic structure, seismicity, and modern geodynamics of the roughly EW-trending Pyrenees are considered based on the literature data. Geological evidence suggests that the structure of this mountain system is dominated by scaly overthrusts partially shifting into tectonic covers and conjugated folds. A lower width of the Pyrenees in the near-NS direction, across the strike, which was expected in the context of the plate-tectonic concept due to compression resulting from the convergence of the Eurasian Plate in the north and the African and Iberian lithospheric plates in the south, has not been confirmed by the geodetic data. GPS measurements reveal a higher width of the Pyrenees, also established by the seismological data based on the interpretation of the earthquake foci sets. Thus, there is a clear contradiction between the results obtained, on the one hand, by geological methods and, on the other hand, by geodetic and seismological surveys. This contradiction is proposed to be eliminated by invoking the previously developed ideas of the volume expansion of stratified rocks and the expansion of the corresponding parts of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s crust as a result of the inflow of additional mineral material with deep fluids rising from the lower crust/upper mantle.'

'Six human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) and eight human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) cases newly isolated from the South American countries of Colombia and Chile were analyzed together with the two Amerindian HTLV-I isolates previously reported. All of the HTLV-I isolates belonged to the transcontinental subgroup of the \xe2\x80\x9ccosmopolitan\xe2\x80\x9d group, and Colombian isolates, including those from native Amerindians and Negroes, formed a single tight cluster within this subgroup. The transcontinental subgroup consisted of isolates from various regions such as the Caribbean basin, India, Iran, South Africa, Sakhalin, and Japan, and included isolates from the \xe2\x80\x9cAinu\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOkinawa\xe2\x80\x9d people, regarded as relatively pure Japanese descended from the prehistoric \xe2\x80\x9cJomon\xe2\x80\x9d period which began more than 10,000 years ago. This implied a dissemination of the subgroup associated with the movement of human beings in ancient times. On the other hand, all of the HTLV-II isolates from native Amerindians in Colombia and Chile belonged to the HTLV-IIb subtype which has previously been reported to be mainly endemic in certain populations of native Amerindians. The southernmost isolate from Chile, showing wide distribution of the llb subtype in native South Amerindians and largest heterogeneity of the subtype in Colombian isolates, supported the idea that the HTLV-IIb subtype has been endemic for a long time in native Indians of South America.'

'Practice theory focuses attention on agency and the generative dimensions of sites and material culture in terms of social formation and reproduction. This approach is applied to the ritualization of midden deposits by Torres Strait Islanders of northeast Australia. Ritualization of middens was achieved by three depositional strategies of privileged differentiation: referencing of mortuary remains, discrimination of animal bones and mounding of deposits. In addition, ritualized middens were spatially separated into small residential mounds and large communal feasting mounds. Ritualized middening was part of a broader social process of maintaining the biographical status of midden materials as a dimension of community socialization, identify and cohesion.'

' A four-site haplotype system at the dopamine D2 receptor locus (DRD2) has been studied in a global sample of 28 distinct populations.

The four individual markers include three TaqI restriction site polymorphisms (RSPs) \xe2\x80\x93 TaqI \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d sites \xe2\x80\x93 and one dinucleotide short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP). All four of the marker systems are polymorphic in all regions of the world and in most individual populations. The haplotype system shows the highest average heterozygosity in Africa, a slightly lower average heterozygosity in Europe, and the lowest average heterozygosities in East Asia and the Americas. Across all populations, 20 of the 48 possible haplotypes reached a frequency of at least 5% in at least one population sample. However, no single population had more than six haplotypes reaching that frequency. In general, African populations had more haplotypes present in each population and more haplotypes occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in that population. Permutation tests for significance of overall disequilibrium (all sites considered simultaneously) were highly significant (P<0.001) in all 28 populations. Except for three African samples, the pairwise disequilibrium between the outermost RSP markers, TaqI \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d, was highly significant with D\xe2\x80\x99 values greater than 0.8; in two of those exceptions the RSP marker was not polymorphic. Except for those same two African populations, the 16-repeat allele at the STRP also showed highly significant disequilibrium with the TaqI \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d site in all populations, with D\xe2\x80\x99 values usually greater than 0.7. Only four haplotypes account for more than 70% of all chromosomes in virtually all non-African populations, and two of those haplotypes account for more than 70% of all chromosomes in most East Asian and Amerindian populations. A new measure of the amount of overall disequilibrium shows least disequilibrium in African populations, somewhat more in European populations, and the greatest amount in East Asian and Amerindian populations. This pattern seems best explained by random genetic drift with low levels of recombination, a low mutation rate at the STRP, and essentially no recurrent mutation at the RSP sites, all in conjunction with an \xe2\x80\x9cOut of Africa\xe2\x80\x9d model for recent human evolution.'

'We have analyzed 105 autosomal polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) loci for nine East and South-eastern Asian populations (two Japanese, five Han Chinese, Thai, and Burmese populations) and a Caucasian population using a multiplex PCR typing system. All the STR loci are genomewide tetranucleotide repeat markers of which the total number of observed alleles and the observed heterozygosity were 756 and 0.743, respectively, for Japanese populations. Phylogenetic analysis for these allele frequency data suggested that the Japanese populations are more closely related with southern Chinese populations than central and/or northern ones. STRUCTURE program analysis revealed the almost clearly divided and accountable population structure at K=2\xe2\x80\x936, that the two Japanese populations always formed one group separated from the other populations and never belong to different groups at K\xe2\x89\xa53. Furthermore, our new allele frequency data for 91 loci were analyzed with those for 52 worldwide populations published by previous studies. Phylogenetic and multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses indicated that Asian populations with large population size (six Han Chinese, three Japanese, two Southeast Asia) formed one distinct cluster and are closer to each other than other ethnic minorities in east and Southeast Asia. This pattern may be the caviar of comparing populations with greatly differing population sizes when STR loci were analyzed.'

'The residential architecture of Levuka, Fiji, contains a diverse and well-preserved sample of what architectural historians have called the \xe2\x80\x9cBritish tropical bungalow.\xe2\x80\x9d Dating to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these small frame structures bear witness to the in situ development of a descendant colonialist identity amongst the European settlers of the port town. Analysis of the degree to which these houses conform to, and diverge from, the normative traits of the global bungalow style provides insight into the material processes of later colonialist communities and their increasingly complex cultural and social identities.'

'A review of Tirant\xe2\x80\x99s collections and examination of types has resulted in the reidentification ofHaplocheilus argyrotaenia Tirant asHypoatherina valenciennei (Bleeker) which is found throughout the southwestern Pacific and as far north as Japan. The taxonomic status ofH. valenciennei is clarified and Bleeker\xe2\x80\x99s emendation of the original specific epithetvalenciennei tovalenciennesi is rejected. The systematic position of this species is difficult to determine sinceH. valenciennei shows affinities with bothHypoatherina andAtherinomorus. In the light of the present knowledge, Bleeker\xe2\x80\x99s species appears to have greater affinities withHypoatherina and is therefore placed in this genus.'

'The southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, is the ixodid species causing the largest economic losses in tropical agrosystems because of its recurrent invasive success, explosive demography on bovine herds, vector competence for diverse pathogens and frequent development of acaricide resistance. Its ecology and the physiological bases of the acaricide resistances it developed, as well as alternative tick control measures, have been intensively studied for decades. By contrast, the tick population genetic structure and its remarkable ability to quickly adapt to new environments have not yet received much attention. We investigated such issues using population genetics analyses in the recently invaded island New Caledonia. In this paper we aim to describe some guidelines for acarologists willing to investigate the processes at play in Acari invasions. Particular emphasis is given to the accuracy of sampling designs and sampling scales for population genetics to be actually informative on the demographical processes of the species (i.e., its mating rules, the determinants of population limits, population sizes, the relationships between genetic exchanges and geographical distances and relevant ecological factors).'

'This article offers a close analysis of a \xe2\x80\x98classic\xe2\x80\x99 body of ethnographic material on the rhetoric and ritual accompanying bridewealth exchange and argues both for the perspective it provides on the dynamics of cultural continuity, and for the contemporary significance of such continuity for theorising the politics of globalisation. Munn\xe2\x80\x99s study on \xe2\x80\x98spacetime\xe2\x80\x99 provides a perspective on bridewealth,  both as praxis of continuity and of articulation with global processes. I conclude this article by posing the question of whether subjects such as the Maring of Papua New Guinea can be said to have agency at the global level. I argue that the condition of such agency is the alienation of that agency from their specificity as subjects.'

"Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons model predicts the eventual overexploitation or degradation of all resources used in common. Given this unambiguous prediction, a surprising number of cases exist in which users have been able to restrict access to the resource and establish rules among themselves for its sustainable use. To assess the evidence, we first define common-property resources and present a taxonomy of property-rights regimes in which such resources may be held. Evidence accumulated over the last twenty-two years indicates that private, state, andcommunal property are all potentially viable resource management options. A more complete theory than Hardin's should incorporate institutional arrangements and cultural factors to provide for better analysis and prediction."

' Cocos sahnii Kaul, a fossil palm fruit, is validated and described from the Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s earth deposits of Kapurdi village of Rajasthan considered as Early Eocene in age. The fossil best resembles the genus Cocos, particularly Cocos nucifera L., which is now a common coastal element thriving in highly moist conditions. The recovery of this coconut-like fruit, along with earlier described evergreen taxa from the same formation, suggests the existence of typical tropical, warm and humid coastal conditions during the depositional period. The present arid to semi-arid climatic conditions occurring in Rajasthan indicate drastic climate change in the region during the Cenozoic. The possible time for the onset of aridity in the region which caused the total eradication of semi-evergreen to evergreen forests is discussed, as well as the palaeobiogeography of coconuts.'

'Complementary to previous work mainly based on seismic interpretation, our compilation of geophysical data (multibeam bathymetry, gravity, magnetic and seismic) acquired within the framework of the ZoN\xc3\xa9Co (ongoing since 1993) and FAUST (1998\xe2\x80\x932001) programs enables us to improve the knowledge of the New Caledonia Basin, Fairway Basin and Fairway Ridge, located within the Southwest Pacific region. The structural synthesis map obtained from geophysical data interpretation allows definition of the deep structure, nature and formation of the Fairway and New Caledonia Basins. Development of the Fairway Basin took place during the Late Cretaceous (95\xe2\x80\x9365 Ma) by continental stretching. This perched basin forms the western margin of the New Caledonia Basin. A newly identified major SW\xe2\x80\x93NE boundary fault zone separates northern NW\xe2\x80\x93SE trending segments of the two basins from southern N\xe2\x80\x93S trending segments. This crustal-scale fault lineament, that we interpret to be related to Cretaceous-early Cainozoic Tasman Sea spreading, separates the NW\xe2\x80\x93SE thinned-continental and N\xe2\x80\x93S oceanic segments of the New Caledonia Basin. We can thus propose the following pattern for the formation of the study area. The end of continental stretching within the Fairway and West Caledonia Basins (\n65\xe2\x80\x9362 Ma) is interpreted as contemporaneous with the onset of emplacement of oceanic crust within the New Caledonia Basin\xe2\x80\x99s central segment. Spreading occurred during the Paleocene (62\xe2\x80\x9356 Ma), and isolated the Gondwanaland block to the west from the Norfolk block to the east. Finally, our geophysical synthesis enables us to extend the structural Fairway Basin down to the structural Taranaki Basin, with the structural New Caledonia Basin lying east of the Fairway Basin and ending further north than previously thought, within the Reinga Basin northwest of New Zealand.'

'Hypotheses concerning the origins of modern humans have been intensively debated, and two competing models, the recent \xe2\x80\x9cOut-of-Africa\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMultiregional Evolution\xe2\x80\x9d paradigms, have dominated research and discussions for decades. Evidence from China has played a fundamental role in this debate: regional continuity and replacement by populations in-migrated from Africa have both been suggested and supported mainly by paleoanthropologists and geneticists, respectively. As more evidence has accumulated, new results obtained, and more scholars from various disciplines become involved, supporters of the recent \xe2\x80\x9cOut-of-Africa\xe2\x80\x9d model agree more or less with the \xe2\x80\x9cMultiregional Evolution\xe2\x80\x9d model regarding the complex history of modern humans and their interbreeding with other archaic populations (e.g., Neandertals). Recent discoveries of new human fossils, Paleolithic archaeological materials, and ancient DNA evidence in China have yielded a large body of information regarding the formation and development of modern humans in this region. However, controversies continue, including that most molecular biologists insist on the replacement of archaic populations by modern humans dispersed from Africa, while most paleoanthropologists and archaeologists propose an enhanced \xe2\x80\x9cContinuity with Hybridization\xe2\x80\x9d model. In this paper, we compile new results and progress in China and present the current debates and issues on the origins of modern humans. Finally, we offer several suggestions for future studies.'

'Genetic markers included in forensic identity panels must exhibit Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium (HWE and LE). \xe2\x80\x9cUniversal\xe2\x80\x9d panels designed for global use can fail these tests in regional jurisdictions exhibiting high levels of genetic differentiation such as the Indonesian archipelago. This is especially the case where a single DNA database is required for allele frequency estimates to calculate random match probabilities (RMPs) and associated likelihood ratios (LRs). A panel of 65 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a reduced set of 52 SNPs have been selected from 15 Indonesian subpopulations in the HUGO Pan Asian SNP database using a SNP selection strategy that could be applied to any panel of forensic identity markers. The strategy consists of four screening steps: (1) application of a G test for HWE; (2) ranking for high heterozygosity; (3) selection for LE; and (4) selection for low inbreeding depression. SNPs in our Indonesian panel perform well in comparison to some other universal SNP and short tandem repeat (STR) panels as measured by Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact test for HWE and LE and Wright\xe2\x80\x99s F statistics.'

'Coral reef ecosystems are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet. In addition to their value in terms of biodiversity, coral reefs provide food and resources for over 500\xc2\xa0million people. Despite their importance, coral reefs are declining at a rapid rate (1\xe2\x80\x932% per year) as a result of a range of local (e.g., overexploitation of fisheries, declining water quality) and global (e.g., global warming and ocean acidification) drivers. Extensive experimental and field evidence suggests that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of 450\xc2\xa0ppm will lead to the loss of coral-dominated reef systems, with the prospect that dangerous levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide for coral reefs were exceeded in 1979 when mass coral bleaching was reported for the first time. The exact response of coral reefs remains uncertain although it is highly unlikely that coral-dominated reef systems will be present in future oceans at the current rate of warming and acidification of the world\xe2\x80\x99s tropical oceans. The loss of these important coastal ecosystems will diminish the resources available to hundreds of millions of people along tropical coastlines. Understanding the impacts on people and industry is an imperative if we are to devise effective systems by which tropical coastal communities are to adapt to rapidly changing tropical coastal environments. Our current understanding of these important issues, however, is in a relatively undeveloped state and must be a priority of future research.'

'A population sample from people of diverse ethnic origins living in New Zealand serves as a database to test methods for inference of population subdivision. The initial null hypothesis, that the population sample is homogeneous across ethnic groups, is easily rejected by likelihood ratio tests. Beyond this, methods for quantifying subdivision can be based on the probability of drawing alleles identical by descent (F ST ), probabilities of matching multiple locus genotypes, and occurrence of unique alleles. Population genetic theory makes quantitative predictions about the relation betweenF ST , population sizes, and rates of migration and mutation. Some VNTR loci have mutation rates of 10\xe2\x88\x922 per generation, but, contrary to theory, we find no consistent association between the degree of population subdivision and mutation rate. Quantification of population substructure also allows us to relate the magnitudes of genetic distances between ethnic groups in New Zealand to the colonization history of the country. The data suggests that the closest relatives to the Maori are Polynesians, and that no severe genetic bottleneck occurred when the Maori colonized New Zealand. One of the central points of contention regarding the application of VNTR loci in forensics is the appropriate means for estimating match probabilities. Simulations were performed to test the merits of the product rule in the face of subpopulation heterogeneity. Population heterogeneity results in large differences in estimates of multilocus genotype frequencies depending on which subpopulation is used for reference allele frequencies, but, of greater importance for forensic purposes, no five locus genotype had an expected frequency greater than 10\xe2\x88\x926. Although this implies that a match with an innocent individual is unlikely, in a large urban area such chance matches are going to occur.'

'\xe2\x80\x82The JC virus (JCV) is a ubiquitous human polyomavirus that frequently resides in the kidneys of healthy individuals and is excreted in the urine of a large percentage of the population. Geographic-specific JCV variants, isolated from urine and from brain of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) patients, have been grouped into seven distinct genotypes based on whole genome analysis and by individual polymorphic nucleotides (typing sites) in the VP1 coding region. Mutations in the archetypal regulatory region, sometimes consisting of deletions and/or duplications, are also useful taxonomic characters for further characterizing and subdividing genotypes. Investigation of JCV variation in Papua New Guinea (PNG) revealed three distinct variants called PNG-1, PNG-2, and PNG-3. These variants exhibited consistent coding region and regulatory region mutations. Evolutionary analysis of 32 complete JCV genomes including six new viral genomes from the western Pacific suggests that the new PNG JCV variants are closely associated with the broad group of Type 2 strains of JCV found throughout Asia, forming a monophyletic group with the Northeast Asian strains (Type 2A). Within the Type 2 clade, however, the PNG JCV variants cluster as two distinct groups and are therefore described here as new JCV genotypes designated Type 2E and Type 8.'

"The sample interval for the selection of extreme magnitudes plays an important part in the quality of Gumbel model fitting. A short sample interval can produce many observations, which is helpful in obtaining a reliably fitting model. However a short sample interval can bring many dummy ``observations'', a condition which adversely biases the fitting. The short sample interval also increases the chance to introduce non-independent observations as well, which violates a basic requirement of the Gumbel model. On the other hand, a large time interval not only reduces the number of observations, but also enlarges the observation error. Thus, for Greece, the most suitable parameters of the third Gumbel extreme model are obtained by using a sample interval which produces minimum error. In consideration of the reliability of the seismic data, earthquakes with magnitude M \xe2\x89\xa5 5.5 in Greece and its surrounding region after 1900 are used mainly in the present paper. In order to obtain well resolved contour maps with smooth changes a 2\xc2\xb0\xc3\x97 2\xc2\xb0 cell with half-degree overlap strategy was used to scan the region. The most expected largest earthquake for the next fifty, one hundred and two hundred years are estimated for each cell. Likewise, the events with magnitude at a probability of 90\\% of non-exceedance over the next fifty, one hundred and two hundred years are estimated for each cell. In parallel to this procedure we also analyze the 67 shallow seismic zones outlined by Papazachos and his colleagues and detail individual zone results where these are obtained. The most perceptible earthquake magnitude for the range of intensities I = {VI}, VII and VIII are also calculated. All results show that the areas around the Hellenic Arc and the Cephalonia Transform Fault for Greece have comparatively high frequency of destructive earthquakes accompanied by a high occurrence probability of moderate earthquakes (M \xe2\x89\xa5 5.5)."

'Halofantrine is a phenanthrenemethanol antimalarial that is effective against asexual forms of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. It has no action on gametocytes or hypnozoites in the liver. The drug is administered as a racemic mixture but the (+)- and (\xe2\x88\x92)-enantiomers show no difference in activity in vitro. Three formulations for oral administration are available for human use, i.e. tablets, capsules and suspension. Toxicity studies in animals suggest that halofantrine has very low toxicity both in short term and long term animal studies, and there has been no evidence of mutagenicity in these studies.'

'Most towns in Papua New Guinea are small and the hierarchy comprises many isolated outstations and small towns. As a response to changes in economic policy the largest towns are growing rapidly at the expense of the small service centres. Changes in the population structure of these large towns have resulted in high rates of natural increase, while rural urban migration is steadily bringing in newcomers, to face urban unemployment and a lack of adequate housing. A secondary urban problem arises from the colonial legacy of urban zoning, which exacerbates the housing shortage and has created artifical socioeconomic residential areas. Although social differences are relatively small, the policy of economic growth will increase the gap between rich and poor, while urban unemployment and lack of housing have reached a crisis level in the rapidly growing big towns.'

'We have further characterized the Asian genotypes (Types 2 and 7) and subtypes of JC virus (JCV). Urine samples from 224 individuals with Han and Mongolian populations were collected in five regions in eastern China: Kunming, Chengdu, Shenyang, Chifeng, and Manzhouli. Also, 99 urine samples were collected from coastal and hill groups in Kerala, southern India, and 23 urine samples from Seoul, Korea. PCR products of four typing fragments were sequenced, including two in the VP1 gene, as well as one each in the VT intergenic region and regulatory region. It was possible to clone and sequence a total of 42 JCV whole genomes (~5120 bp). Five genotypes of JCV (Types 7A, 7B, 7C, 2D, and 4) were found in China, four genotypes (Types 2D, 7C, 4, and 1B) in southern India, and three genotypes (Types 7B, 2A, and 1A) in Korea. Type 7A was most prevalent in South China (59\xe2\x80\x9364%) and Type 7B was predominant in northeast China and Inner Mongolia (67\xe2\x80\x9377%). Type 7C strains were spread throughout North and South China (3\xe2\x80\x9314%), while Type 2D strains were found only in the two Mongolian groups (9\xe2\x80\x9310%). In southern India, Type 2D was predominant in the coastal group (95%), and two major types, Type 7C (50%) and Type 2D (35%), were prevalent in the tribal hill groups. In Korea two major genotypes were found: Type 7B (50%) and Type 2A (43%). Phylogenetic reconstruction places the Chinese genotypes in the Afro-Asiatic supercluster, but distinct from the Mongolian and Indian strains (Type 2D), as well as the Korean and Japanese genotype (Type 2A) that predominates in the Americas.'

'This article presents a survey of Neolithic economy, land use, trade, natural environment, and usage of plant and animal resources in central Europe, 5415\xe2\x80\x932240 B.C. (4500\xe2\x80\x931800 bc). Early, Middle A and B and Late Neolithic materials are summarized and compared. The earliest farmers expanded from southern Hungary and adjacent areas into central Europe over a relatively short time period, 100\xe2\x80\x93200 years. They occupied areas only with good soils; thus probably hunters and gatherers continued to exist in many regions of central Europe. There is an increase in population and more upland areas are exploited for farming during the Middle Neolithic A and B periods. By the Middle Neolithic B period, low-level hierarchical or ranked societies appear in some regions of central Europe. The Late Neolithic may represent a modification of the mixed farming strategy observed during the earlier periods. Perhaps the herding of domestic animals became more important.'

'Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are often accompanied by autoimmune phenomena. The underlying mechanisms for these associations remain uncertain, although T cell activation seems to be important. Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) has been detected in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, mostly in regions of the world which are endemic for the virus, and where association of HTLV-1 with rheumatological manifestation is not rare. We present here the case of a 58 year old man who presented with cytopenias, leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the skin and glomerulopathy, and was diagnosed as MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts - RAEB 1). The patient also tested positive for HTLV-1 by PCR. After 8 monthly cycles of 5-azacytidine he achieved a complete hematologic remission. Following treatment, a second PCR for HTLV-1 was carried out and found to be negative. This is the first report in the literature of a HTLV-1-positive MDS with severe autoimmune manifestations, which was treated with the hypomethylating factor 5-azacitidine, achieving cytogenetic remission with concomitant resolution of the autoimmune manifestations, as well as HTLV-1-PCR negativity. HTLV-1-PCR negativity may be due to either immune mediated clearance of the virus, or a potential antiretroviral effect of 5-azacytidine. 5-azacytidine is known for its antiretroviral effects, although there is no proof of its activity against HTLV-1 infection in vivo.'

'DNA analysis of the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin gene clusters has revealed substantial variability between individuals and populations. As well as restriction enzyme site and length polymorphisms, variation in gene copy number and type is observed. Because of this extensive polymorphism DNA analysis offers a highly informative method of studying genetic affinities between human populations. Haplotypes, consisting of a set of restriction enzyme polymorphisms distributed along the cluster, have been developed for both loci. Analysis of the molecular basis of numerous \xce\xb2-thalassaemia alleles has revealed, in general, different sets of mutations in different populations, indicating that these postdate the racial divergence. Recent microepidemiological studies on the distribution of \xce\xb1-thalassaemia support the hypothesis that this condition, like the {ie16-1}, has been selected because it confers protection against malaria. Population-specific DNA polymorphisms at these and other loci promise to be of considerable value to genetic anthropology.'

'Alkaline volcanic rocks, sometimes feldspathoid bearing, appear in variable stratigraphic positions within the Eocene of the middle part of Central Iran. No magmatic zonation and no K2O enrichment in both time and space can be found in this volcanic sequence. These facts together with other geochemical and geological features of the Iranian Eocene provinces do not agree with a volcanism related to a subduction zone model.'

'Oral glucose tolerance tests (75 g) in 185 urban residents of Port Moresby and 105 ethnically similar rural villagers showed that 15.8% of urban residents had diabetes mellitus (two hour plasma glucose > 11.0 mmol/l and a total of 22% were glucose intolerant (plasma glucose > 9.0 mmol/l), compared with 1.0% and 5.5% in rural people. \xe2\x80\x94 Urban men and women were significantly fatter than rural people, but within each population glucose tolerance was not significantly related to weight or to age, although the numbers of old people studied were small. Compared to Australians the Papua New Guinea subjects had a higher fasting plasma insulin (16.5 vs 10.7 \xce\xbcU/ ml, p = < 0.05); independent of weight fasting plasma insulin was significantly higher in the rural than urban people studied. After the glucose load, plasma insulin and glucose levels were positively correlated in rural people. In contrast, for the urban group the relation best fitted a quadratic function, with decline in plasma insulin at high levels of glucose. \xe2\x80\x94 The prevalence of diabetes in urbanised Melanesians in Papua New Guinea appears similar to other South Pacific countries.'

'There has been much recent interest in the origin of intermediate lava and several hypotheses are: 1) direct melting of the mantle under water-saturated conditions, 2) partial melting of altered crust, 3) fractional crystallization of parent magma, and 4) magma mixing of mafic magmas with dacitic/rhyolitic magmas. Volcanic rocks series ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite (SiO2 ranges from 53.8 to 63.0 wt.%) from the eastern Manus Basin were detected for major and trace element compositions to understand their origin. Low H2O contents, positive correlations of La-SiO2 and Yb-SiO2, oxygen isotope data and the indistinct change of trace element concentrations in oscillatory zoning of plagioclase phenocrysts rule out the models in which silicic lava results from direct melting of hydrous mantle, partial melting of altered oceanic crust or gabbros, and magma mixing, respectively. Besides, the geochemical data of whole rock and melt inclusions indicate that fractional crystallization plays a dominant role in generating the intermediate lava with subduction features.'

'This paper proposes that syntactic ergativity should be understood as a construction-based phenomenon rather than a parametric property that defines a subset of morphologically ergative languages. It argues that syntactic ergativity arises when the relevant operation is sensitive to (abstract) Case. Since not all syntactic operations are sensitive to Case, it is expected that some morphologically ergative languages do not show syntactic ergativity, or even demonstrate syntactic split ergativity. As an illustration, two types of coordination reduction in Tongan (Polynesian) are examined: pea-coordination showing an ergative/absolutive pattern and mo-coordination showing a nominative/accusative pattern. It is argued that DP ellipsis in pea-coordination is a Case-sensitive operation, i.e., PF deletion based on featural identity, whereas mo-coordination involves a null pronoun and LF copying, which is based on positional identity, regardless of Case.'

'Drawing on Raewyn Connell\xe2\x80\x99s Southern Theory (2007), Carrington et al. (British Journal of Criminology, 56(1), 1\xe2\x80\x9320, 2015) have called for a de-colonization and democratization of criminological knowledge, which, they argue, has privileged the epistemologies of the global North. Taking up the challenge of \xe2\x80\x9csouthern criminology,\xe2\x80\x9d in this paper we examine the concept of race as a political artifact of northern thinking. The idea of race is durable in criminology. To illustrate this, we examine the racialization of Aboriginal Australians. Given the relationship between processes of racialization and criminalization, criminology should avoid engaging in practices which produce or reinforce racial schema. Further, with reference to southern epistemologies, we offer an alternative construct of human difference and diversity grounded in discourses of belonging specific to Australasian cultures.'

'Habitat fragmentation is a major threat to biodiversity, as it can alter ecological processes at various spatial and trophic scales. At the species level, fragmentation leading to the isolation of populations can trigger reductions in genetic diversity, potentially having detrimental effects on population fitness, adaptability and ultimately population persistence. Leptomyrmex pallens is a widespread rainforest ant endemic to New Caledonia but now confined to habitat patches that have been fragmented by anthropogenic fire regimes over the last 200\xc2\xa0years. We investigated the social structure of L. pallens in the Aoupini\xc3\xa9 region (c.a. 4900\xc2\xa0ha), and assessed the impacts of habitat fragmentation on its population genetic structure. Allele frequencies at 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci were compared among 411 worker ants from 21 nests distributed across the region. High within-nest relatedness (r\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.70\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.02), and a single queen found in 38\xc2\xa0% of the nests by pedigree analysis indicate that the species is monogynous to weakly polygynous. Estimates of gene flow and genetic structure across the region were subsequently determined using a combined dataset of single workers per nest and of unrelated foraging workers. These estimates coupled with a comprehensive landscape genetic analysis revealed no evidence of significant population structure or habitat effects, suggesting that the Aoupini\xc3\xa9 region harbours a single panmictic population. In contrast, analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data revealed a high degree of genetic structuring, indicating limited maternal gene flow and suggesting that gene flow among nests is driven primarily by winged males. Overall these findings suggest that fire-induced habitat fragmentation has had little impact on the population dynamics of L. pallens. Additional studies of less mobile species should therefore be conducted to gain further insights into fire related disturbances on the unique biodiversity and function of New Caledonian ecosystems.'

'Limited data on regional and preferential trade agreements prevent social scientists from testing some of the international cooperation literature\xe2\x80\x99s most important claims. Expert surveys\xe2\x80\x94a technique that is widely used in the field of comparative politics but thus far underutilized in international relations\xe2\x80\x94allow us to capture many aspects of trade agreements for which data would otherwise be unavailable. They also provide us with a means of comparing agreements across regions and issue areas. We present a new dataset of expert opinion on the world\xe2\x80\x99s regional trade organizations. Our survey covers 24 dimensions of 40 different regional agreements\xe2\x80\x94including the perceived effectiveness of trade liberalization, the degree to which dispute settlement mechanisms are easy to use, and the political and international influence of the agreement. Bayesian factor analysis allows us to extract a principal dimension of effectiveness.'

'Natural killer (NK) cell function is regulated by different types of membrane-bound receptors of which killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are the most complex and diverse. KIRs are encoded by 17 different genes located within the leukocyte receptor complex (19q13.4). The frequency with which KIR gene features are present in different human populations differs. Here, we present our results on the KIR gene diversity observed in a large group of mestizos from the central Mexican city of San Luis Potos\xc3\xad. In total, 53 different KIR genotypes were observed, 47 with previously described gene profiles and six harboring novel KIR gene combinations. Group A homozygous haplotypes were seen in 102 individuals (34%), while group B homozygous haplotypes were present in 45 (15%). Heterozygous combinations of groups A and B haplotypes were seen in 153 individuals (51%). Haplotype frequency estimations based on a true content of 600 chromosomes showed a relatively balanced proportion of group A (59.5%) and group B (40.5%) haplotypes in our study population. A homozygous combination of the cA01|tA01 haplotype was present in 33% of the population with other frequent combinations being cA01|tA01, cB03|tB01 in 14.7% and cA01|tA01, cB02|tA01 in 12%. The dendrogram derived from activating KIR gene phylogenetic analysis revealed five clearly distinct clades corresponding to African, East Asian, Arab/Caucasoid, Mexican mestizo/Amerindian and South Asian populations. Our results illustrate the genetic contribution that Caucasoid and Amerindian populations have made toward present-day Mexicans and suggest an important Southeast Asian genetic contribution to native Amerindian populations.'

'The KIR gene cluster exhibits a high degree of polymorphism in terms of gene content as well as allelic polymorphism, and data suggest that it is evolving rapidly. The KIR3DL1 locus is one of the most polymorphic loci within this cluster and is unique in that it encodes an activating receptor KIR3DS1, as well as multiple inhibitory KIR3DL1 allotypes. Because KIR3DS1 has been implicated in a number of diseases, we tested for the presence of KIR3DS1 variants that might affect its expression and activating capacity. Preliminary FACS analysis indicated that indeed some individuals with the KIR3DS1 allele showed no cell surface expression of the molecule. Sequencing analysis identified a variant with a complex deletion/substitution mutation in exon 4 (which encodes the D1 extracellular domain), resulting in a premature stop codon. We subsequently genotyped 3,960 unrelated individuals and determined the frequencies of this allele across geographically distinct world populations. The data indicate that the null KIR3DS1 allele is uncommon, arose on a single haplotype, and spread across geographically distinct populations.'

'The learning difficulties for new entrant chemistry students from a multi-national, regional, tertiary education institution in the South Pacific were investigated using a purpose-designed diagnostic instrument. The instrument contained 25 items distributed across three themes: scientific reasoning, numeracy and scientific language literacy. The research findings suggest that the main learning difficulty facing these students is in numeracy with students able to interpret numerical data presented in graphical form and to complete rudimentary numerical calculations, but unable to use numerical data or perform calculations involving ratios. Targeted remedial tutoring, based on the results of this diagnostic test instrument, rather than content-driven extra tutorials, are suggested for remediation of learning difficulties.'

'Purpose: The aims of this paper are (a) to examine sexualities (especially homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgenderism) and their correlates among Asian- and Pacific Islander (API) Americans, and (b) to explore their implications for community-based health education and prevention targeting API gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) individuals. Study selection: Derived from the literature of human sexuality, sex-roles socialization, and cross-cultural psychology, a framework was developed to examine sexualities as social roles among APIs. Data synthesis: There are three major sections to this article. The first section is a sociohistorical analysis about the diversity of the API communities, followed by a brief review of health beliefs and practices among APIs. The second section examines the framework used to study sexualities among APIs. In the last section, implications for API community-based health education and prevention targeting GLBT individuals are examined in light of a case study. Conclusions: Sexualities among APIs are discussed using a sexualities-as-social-role paradigm. This paradigm emphasizes the powerful influences of cultural forces in articulating social roles or scripts on sexualities. Sexual expression(s) and its correlates (e.g., identity) among API GLBT individuals are the product of a \xe2\x80\x9crelational\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a \xe2\x80\x9clinear\xe2\x80\x9d process\xe2\x80\x94a premise that differentiates it from the \xe2\x80\x9csexual script theory.\xe2\x80\x9d A fact-based case study was used to illustrate the various concepts of the paradigm.'

'Rarely has a developing-country government been better prepared to negotiate with foreign investors than was the new government in Papua New Guinea in the mid-1970s as it prepared top deal with the huge Bougainville and Ok Tedi mining projects. Advised by an array of experts from around the world, including Marian Radetzki, we attained terms that were in many ways a model. But, as subsequent events showed, not everything can be anticipated, even with the best advice. While the Ok Tedi mine has largely been an economic success, its environmental and social effects have not been so benevolent. This article reviews those economic, environmental, and social effects and considers the impact that expert advice can have.'

'Genetic admixture refers to the process or consequence of interbreeding between two or more previously isolated populations within a species. Compared to many other evolutionary driving forces such as mutations, genetic drift, and natural selection, genetic admixture is a quick mechanism for shaping population genomic diversity. In particular, admixture results in \xe2\x80\x9crecombination\xe2\x80\x9d of genetic variants that have been fixed in different populations, which has many evolutionary and medical implications.'

'Mathematical models developed for describing the dynamics of transmission, infection, disease and control of lymphatic filariasis (LF) gained momentum following the 1997 World Health Assembly resolution and the launching of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) in 2000. Model applications could provide valuable inputs for making decisions while implementing large scale programmes. However these models need to be evaluated at different epidemiological settings for optimization and fine-tuning with new knowledge and understanding on infection/disease dynamics.'

'Regional organizations (ROs) have been created across the globe. In the period between 1945 and 2015, there is a total of 76 ROs, which on average are equipped with competencies in around 11 different policy areas. There are two trends. First, both the number of ROs states have joined increases sharply over time as do the number of policy competencies states delegate to ROs. Second, not all states are equally inclined to nurture regional integration. To shed light on these patterns, this paper adopts a state-centered perspective. Based on rationalist international relations and regional cooperation theories, it develops hypotheses on state motives to join ROs and to delegate policy competencies to them. The analysis reveals several interesting insights: First, powerful states are proponents for regional integration. They join ROs, as they can be used as arenas or means to further national interests. Second, trade is also an important incentive. The stronger the trade interests of states are, the more ROs they become members of and the more policy competencies they equip their ROs with. Third, authoritarian states are less inclined to nurture regional integration and join ROs, since they might place limitations on governmental leeway in the future.'

'The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a deltaretrovirus claimed to be aetiologically linked to the adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) besides other minor pathologies. HTLV-1 infection is worldwide distributed, despite its heterogeneous prevalence. Environmental factors and host-genetic background are very likely to determine the epidemiological profile of HTLV-1 prevalence and related disease confinement in distinct human ethnic populations and geographical coordinates, which raises the question if the virus is a real pathogen or a runaway well-organized packed genome of a burden host cell near death process. New methodological approaches need to be proposed and applied in order to prove or discard the hypotheses emerged in the present review.\n'

'The trends in evolutionary research in Japan have largely changed through the introduction of new methodologies such as molecular genetics and multivariate statistics since the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s. The development of ecology and primatology brought another new wave into fields of physical anthropology. This paper reviews briefly general trends in anthropological research now on-going in Japan. Microevolutionary studies of the Japanese and neighboring populations which have a long history in Japan will be reviewed in more detail.'

'This paper re-defines the Permian volcanics of Devonshire as belonging to the high-potassium shoshonitic suite of rocks commonly associated with a late or post-orogenic tectonic setting. Factor analysis is used to classify the rocks into four well defined groups based upon major and extensive trace element data. They are interpreted on an Andean-type plate collision model as being derived from a subduction zone at a depth of some 300 km beneath Hercynian Europe.'

'Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous lengths of homozygous genotypes that are present in an individual due to parents transmitting identical haplotypes to their offspring. The extent and frequency of ROHs may inform on the ancestry of an individual and its population. Here we use high density (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89777,962) bi-allelic SNPs in a range of cattle breed samples to correlate ROH with the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients and to validate subsequent analyses using 54,001 SNP genotypes. This study provides a first testing of the inference drawn from ROH through comparison with estimates of inbreeding from calculations based on the detailed pedigree data available for several breeds.'

'The decline in sea cucumber fisheries that serve the Asian dried seafood market has prompted an increase in global sea cucumber aquaculture. The tropical sandfish (Holothuria scabra) has, in this context, been reared and produced with mixed success. In the Western Indian Ocean, villagers often participate in the export fishery for sea cucumbers as a source of income. However, with a growing concern of depleted stocks introduction of hatcheries to farm sandfish as a community livelihood and to replenish wild stocks is being promoted. This review identifies and discusses a number of aspects that constitute constraints or implications with regard to development of sandfish farming in the region. The conclusion is that for sandfish farming to live up to its expectations the possible impacts need to be further studied, and that improved evaluation of ongoing projects is required. In the interim, a precautionary approach toward new enterprise activities is suggested.'

'The petrology and chemistry of alkaline rhyolites from Western Bahia State are investigated. Original mineralogy and bulk chemistry are modified by secondary processes (cataclastic metamorphism, hydrothermal leaching). The overall chemistry suggests a pattern consistent with derivation from material of near quartz-feldspar cotectic composition. This may represent a pathway for crustal fractionation and for partial melting within the continental crust of material of potassium-rich granitic composition. Ancient basemental biotite-rich gneisses are considered to be the most probable starting material. Possible correlations of volcanism with the main tectonics of the area and of the whole Brazilian shield are discussed.'

'Small-scale society furnishes the bread and butter of archeological research. Yet our understanding of what these communities did and how they achieved their purpose is still rudimentary. Using the ethnography of contact-era New Guinea, this paper presents a \xe2\x80\x9csocial signaling\xe2\x80\x9d model of small-scale social systems that archeologists may find useful for contextualizing and interpreting the material record of these societies. It proposes that the organization of small-scale society was oriented, among other goals, towards biological and social reproduction, subsistence optimization, and military defense. To advance these multiple collective interests, however, these communities had to deal with three problems: an optimality problem, a conflict-of-interest problem, and a free-rider problem. The optimality problem was solved with a modular (or segmented) social structure, the conflict-of-interest problem by a process of social signaling, and these two solutions together operated to resolve the free-rider problems they created. In addition to explaining the structure and function of small-scale societies, the model provides a unified framework that can account for the ceremonial behaviors, core cultural conceptions, and leadership forms that these societies generated.'

'The \xe2\x80\x9cBoserup hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d contends that land-intensive systems of agriculture will be adopted only when high population density precludes the use of land-extensive methods. In the Kerayan District of East Kalimantan (Indonesia) the Lun Dayeh practice permanent-field rice cultivation despite very low human densities. An examination of the relative labor efficiencies of shifting and permanent-field agriculture in the Kerayan, as well as of local environmental and historical variables, explains why this \xe2\x80\x9canomalous\xe2\x80\x9d situation exists. It is argued that since relative success in production of rice by shifting- and permanent-field irrigated methods depends on many natural and social conditions other than levels of population density, the \xe2\x80\x9cenvironment-free\xe2\x80\x9d Boserup hypothesis cannot adequately explain or predict the occurrence of particular forms of rice agriculture.'

'Field relationships, petrography and chemistry (including selected trace elements) of an occurrence of high-K diorite from Yeoval, N.S.W., Australia, are described. The Yeoval diorite complex is a calc-alkaline suite of rocks ranging from gabbros through diorites to granites with an association of fine-grained types. The dominant type of diorite is high in potassium (>2% K2O) and their classification is based mainly on chemical data rather than conventional petrography. As such the high-K diorites may be correlated with the high-K andesites of orogenic regions. Comparisons with occurrences of high-K andesites are made. Data are presented to show that the gabbros and diorites are genetically related whereas no relation between the diorites and granites can be established.'

'This paper examines gender differences in out-marriage rates in the United States among 16 race and ethnic groups. Among most groups of Asian Americans, females are more likely to marry whites than are their male counterparts, the reverse of the pattern among African Americans discussed by Merton (1941). We find some Hispanic-American groups in both camps. We explore whether the greater contact between white U.S. military personnel in Asian countries explains the pattern of Asian white marriages. We also introduce a new statistical approach that facilitates comparisons across multiple race and ethnic groups. Data from the 1% sample of the 1990 Census are analyzed in this study.'

'Studies find that economic, political, and social globalization \xe2\x80\x93 as well as trade liberalization specifically \xe2\x80\x93 influence the prevalence of overweight and obesity in countries through increasing the availability and affordability of unhealthful food. However, what are the mechanisms that connect globalization, trade liberalization, and rising average body mass index (BMI)? We suggest that the various sub-components of globalization interact, leading individuals in countries that experience higher levels of globalization to prefer, import, and consume more imported sugar and processed food products than individuals in countries that experience lower levels of globalization.'

'There exists an unfounded and unproven \xe2\x80\x98common sense\xe2\x80\x99 belief that human beings possess the innate mechanistic urge to reproduce clearly evident in the behavior of all other sexually reproducing animals. As such, the heterosexual component of human behavior is by and large viewed as being genetic, whereas it is homosexuality that is primarily the focus of scientific investigations into human sexual orientation. A historical review of homosexuality in diverse cultures reveals that significantly many cultures have existed where (male) bisexuality has been rather universal and that all cultures have condemned exclusive homosexuality, either legally or with the threat of social rejection. Neither of these facts can be rationalized using the ballpark \xe2\x80\x9810%\xe2\x80\x99 statistic for homosexuality believed to be representative of human beings. This paper will attempt to provide a general underlying explanation for human sexuality as a whole. It will be argued that the varied forms of human sexual expression may be explained to some extent with the view that by virtue of their supreme intelligence, human beings do not possess an instinct to engage in heterosexual intercourse, human sexual orientation is fully determined by environment alone, and that due to rather universal childhood behavioral tendencies, human beings have a bias for acquiring a homosexual orientation over a heterosexual one or a bisexual one. Controlling this dominant homosexual tendency has always been a basic requirement for the propagation of societies.'

'Management strategies for coral reefs are dependant on information about the spatial population structure and connectivity of reef organisms. Genetic tools can reveal important information about population structure, however, this information is lacking for many reef species. We used a mitochondrial molecular marker to examine the population genetic structure and the potential for meta-population dynamics in a direct developing coral reef fish using 283 individuals from 15 reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We employed a hierarchical sampling design to test genetic models of population structure at multiple geographical scales including among regions, among shelf position and reefs within regions. Predictions from island, isolation-by-distance and meta-population models, including the potential for asymmetric migration, local extinction and patterns of re-colonisation were examined.'

'This paper investigates the existence of a continental bias in world trade and the potential differences in this bias across continents and at trade margins. We find a moderate positive continental bias in trade that masks an uneven impact of continental boundaries across continents. At the intensive margin, South America and Africa present a robust negative continental bias, Asia a robust positive one, and North America and Europe a positive or no bias depending on the estimation procedure. Differences also appear for the extensive margin of trade. In particular, the probability of trade is positive for countries in the Americas and Africa.'

'OBS\xe2\x80\x99s were deployed for 26 to 29 days in the eastern Bismarck Sea to investigate the back-arc spreading. Hypocenters of 186 shallow earthquakes were determined using P- and S-waves from at least five stations. In the western survey area, a transform fault zone is marked by a linear micro-earthquake activity striking N65\xc2\xb0W and less than 5 km wide. The predominant type of their focal mechanisms is strike-slip. In the eastern area, several intermittent zones of micro-earthquakes and their strike-slip type focal mechanisms suggest the location of short-length transform faults separating en-echelon spreading ridges.'

'This paper examines three ancient traits of religion whose origins likely date back to the Upper Paleolithic: ancestor worship, shamanism, and the belief in natural and animal spirits. Evidence for the emergence of these traits coincides with evidence for a dramatic advance in human social cooperation. It is argued that these traits played a role in the evolution of human cooperation through the mechanism of social scrutiny. Social scrutiny is an effective means of reducing individualism and enhancing prosocial behavior. Religion\xe2\x80\x99s most ancient traits represent an extension of the human social world into the supernatural, thus reinforcing within-group cooperation by means of ever-vigilant spiritual monitors. Believing that the spirits were always watching may have helped reduce the number of non-cooperators within a group while reinforcing group behavioral norms, thus allowing humanlike levels of cooperation to emerge.'

'The prevalence of NIDDM in the \xc2\xabPunjabi\xc2\xbb population from north India corroborates the \xc2\xabepidemiological transition\xc2\xbb model. Hospital admittees gave a higher prevalence of NIDDM in urban areas (8.2\xe2\x80\x939.3 percent), as compared to rural areas (2.4 percent), and this difference probably is the outcome of the respective lifestyles. Moreover, urban residents are 3.7 times more likely to develop diabetes than are rural residents. Principal component analysis suggests a high correlation of NIDDM with age, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The combined relative risk of diabetes with hypertension as a risk factor was 5.16 (p<.0001). Findings indicate that a combination of risk factors show significant association with diabetes.'

'The conflicts of interest that prevailed between the great powers in the wake of the First World War eviscerated their ability to respond collectively to the advent of the Great Depression. Instead, each turned to discriminatory trade barriers and trade blocs to try to revive domestic output. Persuaded that trade discrimination exacerbated the political tensions that erupted in World War II, policy makers constructed a postwar economic order that institutionalized nondiscrimination. Thus, Article 1 of the charter of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) mandates most-favored nation (MFN) treatment. We argue here that the MFN clause itself encouraged the adoption of practices and policies that actually recreated discrimination. In particular, we argue, developing countries, long regarded as victims of discrimination, institutionalized it in their negotiations with each other. We examine two developing country PTAs that included about 80 percent of all developing-country GATT members by output (the Global System of Trade Preferences and the Protocol Relating to Trade Negotiations). We show that as in the GATT writ large, their patterns of tariff cuts and trade expansion were highly skewed toward a small number of their largest members. In trying to avoid discrimination, policy makers actually encouraged its de facto adoption.'

"We have investigated the allelic polymorphism of the human ABO-secretor locus (FUT2) in 90 unrelated Papuan-speaking New Guineans (Dani group), 101 admixed New Guineans from Irian Jaya, Indonesia, and 32 New Guineans from Papua New Guinea by DNA sequencing analysis. Whereas the total frequency of various nonfunctional alleles at the FUT2 locus in the worldwide populations so far examined is around 0.5, we have found only one individual heterozygous for a nonfunctional allele in the 90 Dani group members and a frequency of nonfunctional alleles of 0.1\xe2\x80\x930.2 in the admixed New Guineans. Admixed New Guineans had the Asian-specific null allele se  385  and the characteristic nonfunctional allele se  del2  found in Polynesians. In addition, both New Guinean populations had unique functional alleles (Se  375  and Se  400 ) with high frequencies (0.11\xe2\x80\x930.37); these are absent in other populations of the world except for African and Samoan populations. The Se  375  allele had G and C at positions\xc2\xa01009 and 1011 of the 3' untranslated region, respectively, whereas all other FUT2 alleles found so far in the world, except for se  428 , have 1009A and 1011T. The Se  375  allele found in Africans has 1009G and 1011T, or 1009A and 1011T. Corresponding positions of nonhuman primates have G and C, suggesting that the Se  375  allele is one of the ancestral alleles, reflecting the early human migration from Africa to New Guinea and the long isolation of Dani populations from neighboring populations."

"Megapode chicks hatch underground at a depth of between 40 and 150 cm, where external heat sources incubate the eggs. They dig themselves out without assistance from their parents. This is the first detailed study describing how long chicks remain under the soil and how they behave in this environment. 31 chicks of the Australian Brush-turkey (Alectura lathami) were observed while buried under a 40 cm high column of soil in a heated, transparent box. It took them, on average, 40 h (median) to reach the surface (range 26\xe2\x80\x9355 h). After hatching, they only moved enough to form a small cavity within the soil in which they remained almost motionless for an average of 16 h (median). During this time, they dried their plumage, lost the chorioallantoic membrane, and presumably aerated their lungs and air sacs. After the initial resting period, for an average of 21 h (median) they dug upwards in short bouts only, traversing merely 8 cm. During this time they kept free a small cavity around themselves, in which they rested, preened and pecked at items in the soil, some of them invertebrates. Chicks covered the greatest distances (median 23 cm) within the last 64\xe2\x80\x93120 min before emerging from the soil, while digging and pushing vigorously towards the surface, almost non-stop. If it is assumed that other, more endangered megapode species behave in a similar manner following hatching, these results suggest that in captive-release programs, chicks should not be released before the age of approximately 40 h, when they usually leave their natural incubation site. On the basis of these results I also critically discuss the classification of megapodes as \xe2\x80\x98superprecocial\xe2\x80\x99. The present observations suggest that many aspects of the chicks' behaviour, such as the long resting period after hatching, differ little from other precocial birds."

'Accounts of language evolution have largely suffered from a monolingual bias, assuming that language evolved in a single isolated community sharing most speech conventions. Rather, evidence from the small-scale societies who form the best simulacra available for ancestral human communities suggests that the combination of small societal scale and out-marriage pushed ancestral human communities to make use of multiple linguistic systems. Evolutionary innovations would have occurred in a number of separate communities, distributing the labor of structural invention between populations, and would then have been pooled gradually through multilingually mediated horizontal transfer to produce the technological package we now regard as a natural ensemble.'

'After almost three centuries of investigations into the question of what it means to be human and the historical processes of becoming human, archaeologists have amassed a huge volume of data on prehistoric human interactions. One of the largest data sets available is on the global distribution and exchange of materials and commodities. What still remains insufficiently understood is the precise nature of these interactions and their role in shaping the diverse cultures that make up the human family as we know it. A plethora of theoretical models combined with a multitude of methodological approaches exist to explain one important aspect of human interaction\xe2\x80\x94trade\xe2\x80\x94and its role and place in shaping humanity. We argue that trade parallels political, religious, and social processes as one of the most significant factors to have affected our evolution. Here we review published literature on archaeological approaches to trade, including the primitivist-modernist and substantivist-formalist-Marxist debates. We also discuss economic, historical, and ethnographic research that directly addresses the role of traders and trade in both past and contemporary societies. In keeping with the complexities of interaction between trade and other aspects of human behavior, we suggest moving away from the either/or perspective or strong identification with any particular paradigm and suggest a return to the middle through a combinational approach to the study of trade in past societies.'

'Agro-morphological variation in the taro germplasm of Papua New Guinea was estimated using 18 polymorphicdescriptor states to aid in the selection of a core sample for the formation of a regional core collection currentlybeing assembled under the Taro Network for Southeast Asia and Oceania. A total of 276 accessions were strati-fied into five homogenous groups by using a hierarchical approach according to botanical variety (dasheen oreddoe), altitude (high or low) and stolon formation (present or absent). In selecting the core sample, the eddoegroup were directly included because of their rarity in the germplasm collection. While, a ten per cent samplefraction within each group of the dasheen types were selected based on principal component scores. A total of 31accessions were selected for the core sample. Multivariate analysis of the core sample revealed wide variation,which was mainly influenced by botanical variety, plant height, lamina colour and variegation, petiole colour,corm shape, corm weight and palatability. Cluster analysis identified two homogeneous clusters based on predominantcharacters that should be useful to breeders. The results obtained in this study provide useful backgroundinformation for further development of a national core collection.'

'The topic of gold/gold mining contains an admixture of ideas from a variety of disciplines which with further curriculum development can lead to a fully integrated course for year 10 or 11 in P.N.G. high schools. The politics of mining at the present time in P.N.G. might well encourage many companies to help in that curriculum development by providing booklets and other curriculum materials to schools, such as those the mining industry in Australia has already provided for Australian schools (Note 2).'

"If legal enforcement of contracts were omnipresent, omniscient, and costless, the identity and history of one's partners would be irrelevant, since any problems caused by unreliable partners could be remedied effectively. However, when legal enforcement is localized, imperfect, and costly, different governance structures for contracts carry implications for the sets of acceptable contracting partners. When legal enforcement for contracts is based on national law, whose reach is coterminous with a state's territory, acceptable partners tend to be defined territorially. When state enforcement of contract law is weak or nonexistent or when a contract is so vulnerable to nonperformance that it requires auxiliary support, actors must devise an alternative or supplement to state enforcement. The most relevant contracting boundaries then will be ones defining groups that can efficaciously create and maintain intertemporal, inter-issue, and inter-actor linkages. We examine just three of many possibilities: family-based, function-based, and ethnicity- or religion-based groups. These different systems of governance affect which entities are recognized as members in the club of actors, as well as how actors define their contracting boundaries and distinguish between those with whom they contract relatively freely and those with whom their contracting is more circumscribed."

'Modern sugar cane varieties are derived from interspecific crosses involving as many as four species. Because a chromosome increase accompanies certain crosses and backcrosses, modern varieties have very high aneuploid chromosome numbers and complicated genetics. Despite this complexity, the chromosome behavior of some modern varieties approaches that of allopolyploids. In achieving homozygosity, therefore, such varieties should respond to inbreeding almost like diploids.'

'Pleistocene to Recent stratovolcanoes in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea are made up of calc-alkaline to shoshonitic lava, tuff, agglomerate, ash, and lahar deposits. The volcanic rocks are characterized by high and variable Al, high K and total alkalis, and low Fe, Mg, and Ca. There is a continuous variation between high-K calc-alkaline, low-Si high-K calc-alkaline, and shoshonitic rocks. The elements V, Rb, Sr, Zn, Nb, and Ba are high relative to general andesitic abundances, particularly in the shoshonites. The Highlands volcanic rocks originated either in the base of thick sialic crust which is undergoing stabilization after major orogeny and uplift, or more probably, in eclogite sinking through the underlying mantle. Variation in content of K and other \xe2\x80\x9cincompatible\xe2\x80\x9d elements was either inherited from the source rocks in the base of the crust, or was produced by zone refining in a thick upper mantle zone containing interstitial fluid rich in these elements. Further variation, mainly in Fe/Mg, Si, and total alkalis, was caused by minor low-pressure crystal fractionation involving olivine, clinopyroxene, and, to a lesser extent, calcic plagioclase.'

'Recent studies addressing broad-scale species richness gradients have proposed two main primary drivers: contemporary climate and evolutionary processes (differential balance between speciation and extinction). Here, we analyze the global richness patterns of two venomous snake clades, Viperidae and Elapidae. We used ordinary least squares multiple regression (OLS) and partial regression analysis to investigate to what extent actual evapotranspiration (AET; summarizing current environmental conditions) and biogeographical regions (representing evolutionary effects) were associated with species richness. For viperids, AET explained 45.6% of the variance in richness whereas the effect of this variable for elapids was almost null (0.5%). On the other hand, biogeographic regions were the best predictors of elapid richness (56.5%), against its relatively small effect (25.9%) in viperid richness. Partial regressions also revealed similar patterns for independent effects of climate and history in both clades. However, the independent historical effect in Elapidae decreased from 45.2 to 17.8% when we excluded Australia from the analyses, indicating that the strong historical effect that had emerged for the global richness pattern was reflecting the historical process of elapid radiation into Australia. Even after excluding Australia, the historical signal in elapid richness in the rest of the globe was still significant and much higher than that observed in viperid richness at a global scale (2.7% after controlling for AET effects). Differences in the evolutionary age of these two clades can be invoked to explain these contrasting results, in that viperids probably had more time for diversification, generating richness responses to environmental gradients, whereas the pattern of distribution of elapid richness can be more directly interpreted in an evolutionary context. Moreover, these results show the importance of starting to adopt deconstructive approaches to species richness, since the driving factors of these patterns may vary from group to group according to their evolutionary history.'

'Some areas of the world are known to have a low incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis, although the reasons for this are unknown. Furthermore, no complete evaluation of the worldwide variation in the incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis has been published. In the current study, the published medical literature was reviewed to identify all studies conducted in the absence of routine childhood Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccination that reported an incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age. To test the hypothesis that antibiotic use may have influenced the incidence of meningitis, incidence rates were correlated with antibiotic resistance. Seventy-one articles reported an incidence of childhood Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis (median, 21 cases per 100,000 population per year; range, 1\xe2\x80\x9395 cases per 100,000 population per year), with Asia and central/southern Europe reporting lower incidences than other areas (median, 5 and 11 cases per 100,000 per year, respectively). Within these regions of low incidence, the proportion of cerebrospinal fluid specimens that had a leukocyte count or glucose or protein level suggestive of bacterial meningitis but from which no organism was identified was low, indicating that there was no large reservoir of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis that went undetected by the laboratory. Study-specific incidence rates of meningitis correlated with the proportion of isolates resistant to ampicillin (or producing beta-lactamase) (R2=0.35, P=0.0014). The incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis is substantially lower in some areas of the world than others, but this difference is unlikely to be related primarily to laboratory methodology. In contrast, antibiotic use may contribute to the observed differences in incidence.'

'Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder of HTLV-1-host interactions in infected TCD4+ cells. In this study, the HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and HBZ as viral elements and AKT1, BAD, FOXP3, ROR\xce\xb3t and IFN\xce\xbb3 as the host factors were investigated.'

'In this article we examine the history of the production of microarray technologies and their role in constructing and operationalizing views of human genetic difference in contemporary genomics. Rather than the \xe2\x80\x9cturn to difference\xe2\x80\x9d emerging as a post-Human Genome Project (HGP) phenomenon, interest in individual and group differences was a central, motivating concept in human genetics throughout the twentieth century. This interest was entwined with efforts to develop polymorphic \xe2\x80\x9cgenetic markers\xe2\x80\x9d for studying human traits and diseases. We trace the technological, methodological and conceptual strategies in the late twentieth century that established single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as key focal points for locating difference in the genome. By embedding SNPs in microarrays, researchers created a technology that they used to catalog and assess human genetic variation. In the process of making genetic markers and array-based technologies to track variation, scientists also made commitments to ways of describing, cataloging and \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\xe2\x80\x9d human genetic differences that refracted difference through a continental geographic lens. We show how difference came to matter in both senses of the term: difference was made salient to, and inscribed on, genetic matter(s), as a result of the decisions, assessments and choices of collaborative and hybrid research collectives in medical genomics research.'

'This paper examines the question of the nutritional value of cannibalism. Although other authors have concluded that the practice does not have such value, we argue that this cannot properly be determined except in the context of the total subsistence economy and local human ecology. The paper also presents a format for the empirical investigation of foodgetting and new ethnographic information about New Guinea cannibalism. Our major conclusion is that this practice does have nutritional value for certain human groups, specifically tropical peoples living at lowmedium population densities and exploiting a diverse range of animal foods.'

'Egypt is located in the northeastern corner of Africa within a sensitive seismotectonic location. Earthquakes are concentrated along the active tectonic boundaries of African, Eurasian, and Arabian plates. The study area is characterized by northward increasing sediment thickness leading to more damage to structures in the north due to multiple reflections of seismic waves. Unfortunately, man-made constructions in Egypt were not designed to resist earthquake ground motions. So, it is important to evaluate the seismic hazard to reduce social and economic losses and preserve lives. The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment is used to evaluate the hazard using alternative seismotectonic models within a logic tree framework. Alternate seismotectonic models, magnitude-frequency relations, and various indigenous attenuation relationships were amended within a logic tree formulation to compute and develop the regional exposure on a set of hazard maps. Hazard contour maps are constructed for peak ground acceleration as well as 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.5-, 1-, and 2-s spectral periods for 100 and 475\xc2\xa0years return periods for ground motion on rock. The results illustrate that Egypt is characterized by very low to high seismic activity grading from the west to the eastern part of the country. The uniform hazard spectra are estimated at some important cities distributed allover Egypt. The deaggregation of seismic hazard is estimated at some cities to identify the scenario events that contribute to a selected seismic hazard level. The results of this study can be used in seismic microzonation, risk mitigation, and earthquake engineering purposes.'

'This study aimed to introduce clinical manifestations of patients in northeast Iran with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and describe the epidemiological features, as well as risk factors for HTLV-1 infection. This is a cross-sectional study of HTLV-1 infected cases and HAM/TSP patients referred by outpatient neurology clinics as well as Mashhad Blood Transfusion Center from 2005 to 2010. The study comprises 513 cases, including 358 healthy carriers (HCs) and 145 HAM/TSP patients. The majority of carriers were male (73.5\xc2\xa0%), whereas 67.6\xc2\xa0% of HAM/TSP sufferers were female (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). The mean age of HAM/TSP patients and HCs was 45.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa013.6 and 39.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa011.58\xc2\xa0years, respectively (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). The history of transfusion, surgery, hospitalization and cupping was observed in a significant greater number of HAM/TSP patients than the HCs (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001, P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001, P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001 and P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.029, respectively). Gait disturbance was the most common complaint in HAM/TSP patients (72.4\xc2\xa0%). This research develops an HTLV-1 data registry in an endemic area such as Mashhad which can serve useful purposes, including evaluation of clinical and laboratory characteristics of HAM/TSP patients and epidemiological data of HTLV-1-infected cases.'

'Considering that there is no effective treatment for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, this study aimed to assess the impact of triple combination therapy\xe2\x80\x94interferon-\xce\xb1, valproic acid, and prednisolone\xe2\x80\x94on clinical outcomes, main HTLV-1 viral factors, and host anti-HTLV-1 antibody response. HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL), and HBZ and Tax mRNA expression levels were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 13 patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis before and after treatment with 180\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg pegylated interferon once a week, 10\xe2\x80\x9320\xc2\xa0mg/kg/day sodium valproate, and 5\xc2\xa0mg/day prednisolone for 25\xc2\xa0weeks using a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Furthermore, anti-HTLV-1 titer, Osame Motor Disability Score, Ashworth spasticity scale, and urinary symptoms (through standard questionnaire and clinical monitoring) were assessed in patients before and after the treatment. HTLV-1 PVL and HBZ expression significantly decreased after the treatment [PVL from 1443\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89282 to 660\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89137 copies/104 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01); and HBZ from 8.0\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.5 to 3.0\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.66 (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01)]. Tax mRNA expression decreased after the treatment from 2.26\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.45 to 1.44\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.64, but this reduction was not statistically significant (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.10). Furthermore, anti-HTLV-1 titer reduced dramatically after the treatment, from 3123\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89395 to 815\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89239 (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01). Clinical signs and symptoms, according to Osame Motor Disability Score and Ashworth score, improved significantly (both p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01). Urinary symptoms and sensory disturbances with lower back pain were reduced, though not to a statistically significant degree. Although signs and symptoms of spasticity were improved, frequent urination and urinary incontinence were not significantly affected by the triple therapy. The results provide new insight into the complicated conditions underlying HTLV-1-associated diseases.'

'The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of wormian bones (WBs) in different head shapes of Nepalese skulls along with their distribution at various sites. This study was conducted on 70 Nepalese skulls obtained from the Department of Anatomy, Nepal Medical College, and the Institute of Medicine from September 2017 to January 2018. The skulls were examined for the presence and topographic distribution of WBs. The occurrence of WBs at various sites was correlated among different head shapes. The incidence of skulls showing WBs was 88.57%. The WBs were observed at the lambdoid (61.43%), parietomastoid (41.43%), occipitomastoid (27.14%), pterion (25.71%), asterion (24.29%), lambda (11.43%), sagittal (7.14%) and coronal sutures (4.28%). The dominant head type was dolichocephalic (44.29%) and the least dominant was brachycephalic (10%). The maximum number of WBs was shown on brachycephalic (mean 8.86\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x897.13) then hyperdolichocephalic (mean 8.33\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x899.15), mesaticephalic (mean 5.10\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x894.45) and dolichocephalic heads (mean 4.16\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895.30). Brachycephalic heads frequently exhibited WBs at the pterion (57.14%) and at different sutures: lambdoid (71.42%), parietomastoid (57.14%), sagittal (28.57%) and squamous (14.28%). Hyperdolichocephalic heads displayed more lambda (33.33%) and coronal (8.33%) WBs. Similarly, dolichocephalic and mesaticephalic heads showed WBs at the occipitomastoid (35.48%) and asterion (30%), respectively. Inca bones were only identified in three dolichocephalic skulls. Neurosurgeons, radiologists and orthopedists should be careful when doing clinical and surgical procedures on different head shapes of the Nepalese population.'

'Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a life-threatening malignancy of HTLV-1 infected Th lymphocytes. In the present study host\xe2\x80\x93virus interactions were investigated by assessment of HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and host gene expression. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 18 ATLL, 10 HAM/TSP patients and 18 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (ACs). DNA and mRNA of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted for PVL and LAT, BIM, c-FOS and RAD51 gene expression measurement using qRT-PCR. The mean PVL in ATLL patients was 11,430\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa03770\xc2\xa0copies/104 which was statistically higher than ACs, 530\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0119\xc2\xa0copies/104, (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). The expression of BIM, and c-FOS in ATLL patients were higher than HTLV-1 ACs; however, there were no statistically significant differences. The expression of RAD51 as an essential player on DNA repair showed around 160 times increase in ATLL group (166\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa095) compared to ACs (1.04\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.34) which is statistically significant (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between RAD51 expression and HTLV-PVL. The expression of LAT as a central adaptor in TCR signaling interestingly was around 36 times higher in ATLL group than ACs (ATLL; 41.33\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa019.91 vs. ACs; 1.15\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.22, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). This finding showed that TCR signaling pathway mainly provides the growth factors for transformed cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of RAD51 which has been induced in HTLV-1 infected cells as a consequence of virus replication is not able to overcome the DNA damage toward cell transformation.'

"A sample of children from the Nembi Plateau, Papua New Guinea, is monitored for nutritional status, episodes of sickness and disease, diets, work activity of mothers, and weight changes; and health and census records are examined for seasonal patterns of disease, deaths, birth, and birth weights. A seasonal pattern in birth weight reinforced by a seasonal pattern in growth performance and compounded by a seasonal pattern of disease suggests that the time of year in which a child is born is important to the child's growth and health. Yields, labor, and ritual surrounding the gardens give rise to the seasonal pattern of events that impinge upon the health of children."

'The renaissance in the theoretical analysis of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) has focused on formal IGOs (FIGOs), but many IGOs are subject to no formal treaty and/or have no permanent secretariat. Important examples of informal IGOs (IIGOs) include the G-groups that are the locus of much high-level interaction among states. We develop the spectrum of intergovernmental arrangements to show the wide variation in the formalization of international institutions and theorize when states will choose informal arrangements such as an IIGO over (or in combination with) a FIGO. A paired case comparison illustrates our claims that states use IIGOs when they need flexibility, to protect their sovereignty, to maintain close control of information, to lower short term transaction costs for speed, to minimize bureaucracy and to manage uncertainty during times of crisis. Finally, we examine how institutional choice is influenced by power.'

' Using 3D architectural models to assess light availability and root bulkiness in agroforestry systems. In many parts of the humid tropics, coconut trees are frequently intercropped with food crops, or tree crops such as cocoa. The performance of such systems depends on planting patterns, but also on growing conditions for crops below the coconut canopy throughout the development of the coconut trees. We used a modelling approach providing indicators for assessing above-ground competition for light and below-ground competition for space, in order to optimize intercropping in coconut smallholdings. Light transmission and the number of coconut roots in the interrow were assessed in coconut smallholdings from 6 to 60\xc2\xa0years old. The modelling of light transmission through coconut stands was based on three-dimensional virtual coconut trees and a numerical light model that computed the shade cast by coconut trees on underlying crops. Root colonization in the interrow was assessed with virtual 3D coconut root systems. Our results showed that intercropping with shade-tolerant species was not limited by light transmission from the 35th year after coconut tree planting. However, at that stage of coconut tree development, the density of primary roots in the interrow limited intercrop development, especially for root and tuber crops. Alteration of the planting pattern over time increased light transmission but did not significantly affect root density. This modelling approach, which involved little parameterization that was easily done, appeared to be an efficient tool for recommending coconut tree planting patterns and densities, as well as indicating intercrop potential depending on their location in the most sunlit areas with minimum root competition.'

' Pandanus is well represented in Papua New Guinea with over 66 species growing from sea level to 3,000 m. The territory of the Wopkaimin, who live at the headwaters of the Ok Tedi in the Star and Hindenburg Mountains, is particularly rich in wild and domesticated species ofPandanus. Detailed analysis of the species in classification, ecology, subsistence, ritual and material culture not only establishesPandanus as a locally significant plant resource but also contributes to the comparative understanding of ethnobiological systems. A close correspondence with botanical taxa of generic and specific rank and an absence of the most inclusive taxon term for plant are 2 cross-culturally important findings substantiated in WopkaiminPandanus taxonomy.'

'We monitored nine butterfly communities with varying degrees of human disturbance by conducting a census twice a month during 1980 by the line transect method in and around Tsukuba City, central Japan. We analyzed the biodiversity and community structures using the generalist/specialist concept. The site (community) order based on decreasing human disturbance was positively correlated with butterfly species diversity (H\xe2\x80\xb2), species richness (the total number of species), and the number of specialist species in a community, but not with the number of generalist species. The number of generalist species was rather constant, irrespective of the degree of human disturbance. Thus, both the butterfly species diversity and species richness were more dependent on the specialists than the generalists. Our analyses also showed that the generalist species were distributed widely over the communities, and they maintained high population densities, resulting in high rank status in abundance in a community, with more spatial variation in density per species. Specialist species showed the opposite trends. These results demonstrate that the generalist/specialist concept is a powerful tool applicable to analyse the biodiversity and structure of natural communities.'

' Halfordia F.Muell is a genus of rainforest trees or shrubs native to New Guinea, New Britain, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and eastern Australia. There is debate about the number of species that should be recognised in the genus. Four species have been named, but authors have commonly recognised only two species, and some recent treatments accept just one widespread species with a broad ecological range. We sequenced two nrDNA markers (ITS and ETS) and two cpDNA markers (rbcL and trnL\xe2\x80\x93trnF) from samples across the range of Halfordia in Australia and New Caledonia. Three allopatric nrDNA groups were resolved: one from southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales (Group A); one from the Wet Tropics region of North Queensland (Group B); and one from the Cape York region of North Queensland, Torres Strait and New Caledonia (Group C). These groups were also partly differentiated by more slowly evolving cpDNA markers; the exception was one widespread haplotype in Australia (presumed ancestral). The nrDNA groups support recognition of three previously described species: H. leichhardtii (Group A), H. scleroxyla (Group B) and H. kendack (Group C). Divergences among eastern Australia populations are best explained by vicariance and correlate with geographic breaks documented for other taxa (ranging in estimated ages from the mid-late Miocene to the Pleistocene). The broad distribution of Group C, from Cape York to New Caledonia, with less genetic divergence, arguably reflects recent range expansion into New Caledonia involving bird dispersal of fleshy fruits.'

'Helminths have accompanied mankind since the earliest periods of its formation, parasites and humans have been coevolving for a long time and it is considered that it was helminths that played an important selective role in evolution of genes of the human immune system. The article presents the data on the genetic contribution to the intensity and clinical course of helminth infections in different populations, including the results of genome-wide association studies, and discusses the concept of commonality of genes of susceptibility to helminthiases and allergic diseases.'

"The genetic diversity of traditional varieties of crops is the most economically valuable part of global biodiversity and is of paramount importance for future world crop production. The Biodiversity Convention has given a clear mandate for on-farm conservation. However, very little formal research has been done and no agreed set of scientific principles yet exists for on-farm conservation of genetic resources. This lack of scientific knowledge has not prevented an explosion of recommendations on how to conserve agrobiodiversity on-farm and it is possible to identify an emerging paradigm. Through a review of some of the assumptions on which this paradigm is based, we clearly show that if attempts to conserve agrobiodiversity on-farm are based on these misconceptions, they are likely to fail. By assessing the present activities of farmers, we propose a research agenda to increase the diversity available to farmers and to enhance farmers' capacity to manage this diversity dynamically. Increasing genetic diversification, combined with farmers' experimental abilities, and underpinned by the formal system, will ensure greater on-farm conservation of more useful genetic resources."

'Developing countries struggle to provide adequate urban water services, failing to match infrastructure with urban expansion. Despite requiring an improved understanding of alternative infrastructure performance when considering future investments, integrated modeling of urban water systems is infrequent in developing contexts. This paper presents an integrated modeling methodology that can assist strategic planning processes, using Port Vila, Vanuatu, as a case study. 49 future model scenarios designed for the year 2050, developed through extensive stakeholder participation, were modeled with UVQ (Urban Volume and Quality). The results were contrasted with a 2015 model based on current infrastructure, climate, and water demand patterns. Analysis demonstrated that alternative water servicing approaches can reduce Port Vila\xe2\x80\x99s water demand by 35\xc2\xa0%, stormwater generation by 38\xc2\xa0%, and nutrient release by 80\xc2\xa0% in comparison to providing no infrastructural development. This paper demonstrates that traditional centralized infrastructure will not solve the wastewater and stormwater challenges facing rapidly growing urban cities in developing countries.'

'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is one of the most common hereditary enzymopathies worldwide. Mostly G6PD deficient cases are asymptomatic though they may have the risk of neonatal jaundice (NNJ) and acute intravascular hemolysis during oxidative stress. Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) due to G6PD deficiency is rare. In Thailand, one case was reported 40\xc2\xa0years ago and by biochemical study this G6PD was reported to be a new variant G6PD Bangkok. We, herein, report two families with CNSHA due to G6PD deficiency. In the first family, we have been following up the clinical course of the patient with G6PD Bangkok. In addition to chronic hemolysis, he had three acute hemolytic episodes requiring blood transfusions during childhood period. Multiple gallstones were detected at the age of 27. His two daughters who inherited G6PD Bangkok from him and G6PD Vanua Lava from his wife are asymptomatic. Both of them had NNJ and persistent evidences of compensated hemolysis. Molecular analysis revealed a novel missense mutation 825 G\xe2\x86\x92C predicting 275 Lys\xe2\x86\x92Asn causing G6PD Bangkok. In the second family, two male siblings are affected. They had NNJ and several hemolytic episodes which required blood transfusions. On follow-up they have been diagnosed with chronic hemolysis as evidenced by reticulocytosis and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Molecular analysis revealed combined missense mutations in exons 12 and 13. The first mutation was 1376 G\xe2\x86\x92T predicting 459 Arg\xe2\x86\x92Leu (known as G6PD Canton) and the second one was 1502 T\xe2\x86\x92G predicting 501 Phe\xe2\x86\x92Cys. We designated the resulting novel G6PD variant, G6PD Bangkok Noi.'

'Climate change impacts on marine fisheries are being observed in tropical regions, including northern Australia and the Pacific. In the Torres Strait, Islanders have a long association with their sea country that holds significant cultural, social and economic importance. Future impacts of climate change on marine fisheries stocks and supporting habitats will affect Torres Strait Islander communities. We assessed the relative vulnerability of 15 key fishery species in Torres Strait using a semi-quantitative framework modified from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that integrated both ecological and social indicators of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The assessment identified species with high, medium and low vulnerability to projected climate change in 2030. The species assessed as having the highest vulnerability were: Holothuria whitmaei (black teatfish), Pinctada margaritifera (black-lipped pearl oyster), Dugong dugon (dugong), and Trochus niloticus (trochus). A separate prioritisation process that considered the cultural and economic value of species identified three high priority species for future management focus: D. dugon, marine turtles (principally Chelonia mydas) and Panulirus ornatus (tropical rock lobster). These results can inform fishers and managers to prepare for the effects of climate change and minimise impacts. The relatively healthy condition of most fisheries in the Torres Strait is likely to assist successful adaptation.'

'Most of the population in certain areas of Melanesia have one \xce\xb1-globin gene deletion (\xce\xb1 thal2). It is thought that the high frequencies of \xce\xb1 thal2 in this population is due to a selective advantage given by malaria infection to carriers of \xce\xb1 thal2. We are interested in neighboring Polynesia which, although adjacent to Melanesia, has always been free of malaria due to the absence of the vector anopheles. We studied 60 Polynesian Samoans and 150 Malaysians by restriction endonuclease gene mapping using Eco RI, Bam HI, and Bgl II and hybridization to 32P-labeled \xce\xb1-globin gene probe. Seven among the 60 (11.7%) Samoans had triplicated \xce\xb1-globin loci type 1, while none had \xce\xb1 thal2. On digestion with Bgl II the third \xce\xb1-globin gene was found in an additional 3.7kb fragment in all seven Samoans with triplicated \xce\xb1-globin loci, while digestion with Bam HI produced an abnormal elongated 18.2 kb fragment carrying \xce\xb1-globin genes in addition to the normal 14.5 kb fragment. None of the Polynesian Samoans had \xce\xb1 thal2 or \xce\xb1 thal1. Only two of the Malaysians had triplicated \xce\xb1-globin loci.'

'Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a disabling myelopathy, but clinical trials of specific drugs to treat it are lacking. There are many reasons for the absence of specific therapeutic studies, including difficulty in enrolling patients, inadequate measurement tools to evaluate neurologic improvement, and even lack of interest. Oral or intravenous corticosteroids are now the mainstay of HAM/TSP treatment, especially in the initial phase of the disease, when inflammation is more prominent than demyelination. Motor disability, pain, and urinary dysfunction may be ameliorated, but improvement is not sustained in many patients. Valproic acid has emerged as a potential treatment for HAM/TSP; recent evidence shows that this drug can activate viral gene expression and expose virus-infected cells to the immune system, leading to a reduction of the proviral load. Alternative drugs such as methotrexate, pentoxifylline, azathioprine, danazol, and interferon-\xce\xb1 may be used if steroids fail or cannot be tolerated, but they have not been assessed in randomized clinical trials.'

'The development of B-cell lymphomas has been seldom described in HTLV-1 carriers. We present the case of an elderly Peruvian HTLV-1 carrier who was diagnosed with EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Despite an initial good response to therapy, patient died during treatment due to fatal Pneumocystis jirovecci pneumonia. EBV infection is characterized by B-cell lymphotropism and selective immunodeficiency. HTLV-1, on the other hand, induces T-cell dysfunction and B-cell proliferation. Finally, immunosenescence is characterized by T-cell dysregulation, decreased apoptosis and cytokine upregulation. In this elderly patient, the combination of EBV and HTLV-1 coinfection and immunosenescence may have played a role in the development of this aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Furthermore, the immunodeficiency caused by the viral infections and chemotherapy may have played a role in developing life-threatening infectious complications.'

'Infection of T-cells by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a lymphoproliferative malignancy known as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). ATL is characterized by abnormal lymphocytes, calledflower cells, which have cleaved and convoluted nuclei. Tax, encoded by the HTLV-1 pX region, is a critical nonstructural protein that plays a central role in leuke-mogenesis; however, the mechanisms of HTLV-1 oncogenesis have not been clarified fully. In this review, we summarize current thinking on how Tax may affect ATL leukemogenesis.'

'HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is an aggressive neurological disease. The CD4+CD25+ T cell population plays pivotal roles in the maintenance of immunological tolerance and prevention of such autoimmune diseases. In the current study, proviral load (PVL), factor forkhead box p3 (Foxp3), and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR) gene expression and regulatory T cells (Tregs) counts of 21 HAM/TSP patients and 16 HTLV-1 healthy carriers (ACs) were measured using real-time PCR, TaqMan method, and flow cytometry. The demographic, history of disease, and severity of myelopathy were assessed by a checklist and the Osame motor disability score (OMDS). The mean OMDS for HAM/TSP was 4.82\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.37 which had no significant correlation with Treg count or the expression of Foxp3, GITR, and PVL. The CD4+CD25+ cell counts had no significant differences between HAM/TSP and ACs. Findings revealed a higher PVL in HAM/TSPs (313.36 copies/104) compared to ACs (144.93 copies/104, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.035). The Foxp3 and GITR mRNA levels were lower in HAM/TSP patients (11.78 and 13.80, respectively) than those in healthy carriers (18.44 and 21.00, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.041 and 0.03, respectively). There was a significant correlation between Treg frequency and Foxp3 gene expression (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.67, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.006) and GITR and Foxp3 (R\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.84, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.042) in HAM/TSP patients. Furthermore, the transcription factors have strong correlations with CD4+CD25+ T cell frequencies. These findings suggest that HTLV-1 infection can modify the expression of main functional transcription factors, FOXP3 and GITR, which may lead to immune response deterioration of Tregs and consequently HAM/TSP manifestation.'

"Sociologists have drawn on anthropological studies of gift exchange systems to help develop models of exchange in social life. This paper presents a reconsideration of the relatively neglected Maussian view of gift and commodity exchange, drawing on both Mauss'sThe Gift and recent work by anthropologists who have extended his ideas. The Maussian model illustrates the partiality of some sociological models of exchange by showing that people, objects, and social relations form a whole that is created and recreated in different ways when people transact with each other in gift and commodity relations. The paper concludes with an illustration of the utility of Mauss's model, showing how it can extend recent sociological discussions of the social meaning of objects."

'The geographical and climatic patterning in craniofacial morphology among recent hominids has been regarded as relatively reliable evidence of environmental adaptation and natural selection, which is largely attributed to thermoregulation. However, the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on craniofacial features is unclear. Our study employed 3D laser scanning techniques to evaluate the association between geographical (latitude), climatic (annual temperature) factors, and 3D craniofacial measurements in 18 recent populations through bivariate correlation analysis. Significant correlations were found among braincase surface area, zygomatic bone surface area, cranial-facial index (facial surface area relative to braincase surface area) and local temperature, and a clear latitudinal gradient was also found in variation of braincase surface area. No significant correlations were found between zygomatic bone surface area, cranial-facial index and latitude. Our analysis supports the idea that the braincase functions as a radiator and is closely related to direct sunlight. We also suggest that absolute/relative craniofacial surface area varies consistently with predictions derived from Bergmann\xe2\x80\x99s Rule. The mosaic craniofacial traits of American Indians may reflect retention of cold-derived, ancestral features, as well as a response to a slightly warmer climate. Because different craniofacial regions preserve environmental/genetic signatures differentially, caution is suggested when craniofacial anatomy is used for phylogenetic reconstruction and functional-morphological analysis.'

'Obesity has been increasing in adolescents in Fiji and obesogenic dietary patterns need to be assessed to inform health promotion. The objective of this study was to identify the dietary patterns of adolescents in peri-urban Fiji and determine their relationships with standardized body mass index (BMI-z).'

'The S and M segments of a hantavirus, enzymatically amplified from tissues of Cloudland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus nubiterrae) captured during 1985 in West Virginia, diverged from strains of Four Corners virus from the southwestern United States by more than 16% and 6% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that this virus strain (designated Monogahela) forms a possible evolutionary link between the Four Corners and New York hantaviruses.'

'Regional trade agreements (RTAs) and currency unions (CUs) are potentially endogenous trade cost proxies in equations estimating their effects on bilateral trade. In case of both, this problem is magnified by the paucity of reliable instruments. Instead of resorting to the oft-employed alternative of panel data to address selection on just the time-invariant unobservables, this paper assesses the extent to which a positive association between CU or RTA membership and bilateral trade can be considered causal. In addition, it attends to recent concerns over the extensive margin of trade (at the country-level) and the issue of zero trade observations in log-linearized gravity models by relying more on a bivariate probit analysis. Despite not identifying point estimates, striking results are obtained. While most cross-sections exhibit a positive association between both RTAs and CUs and trade, the evidence in favor of a robust causal effect is strong mainly for CUs. However, the magnitude of the CU effect is still sensitive to the amount of selection on unobservables. Moreover, selection into RTAs (CUs) is mostly found to be positive (negative). Finally, the presence of spillovers across the policy regimes is also detected.'

'Anecdotal evidence from many hunter-gatherer societies suggests that successful hunters experience higher prestige and greater reproductive success. Detailed quantitative data on these patterns are now available for five widely dispersed cases (Ache, Hadza, !Kung, Lamalera, and Meriam) and indicate that better hunters exhibit higher age-corrected reproductive success than other men in their social group. Leading explanations to account for this pattern are: (1) direct provisioning of hunters\xe2\x80\x99 wives and offspring, (2) dyadic reciprocity, (3) indirect reciprocity, (4) costly signaling, and (5) phenotypic correlation. I examine the qualitative and quantitative evidence bearing on these explanations and conclude that although none can be definitively rejected, extensive and apparently unconditional sharing of large game somewhat weakens the first three explanations. The costly signaling explanation has support in some cases, although the exact nature of the benefits gained from mating or allying with or deferring to better hunters needs further study.'

'This article examines transformations associated with changes in resource use and land cover dynamics in the community of S\xc3\xa3o Manoel, Maranh\xc3\xa3o state, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. The shifting cultivator peasants in S\xc3\xa3o Manoel integrate swidden fields for annual cropping, the extraction of babassu palm products, and pastures for cattle ranching. Since the early twentieth century, predominant vegetative cover patterns have been altered from species-rich mature forests to secondary succession with babassu dominant to pasture or swidden fields containing palm stands of various densities. A grounded political ecology of resource use in the area suggests that management strategies and the resulting land cover dynamics integrate site-specific decisions of peasant producers. I discuss the trajectory of production strategies in S\xc3\xa3o Manoel since the establishment of the community in the 1920s, and identify the multiple dimensions affecting resource use and environmental outcomes, with an emphasis on the period following land struggles and the recovery of peasant tenure rights in the mid-1980s. The analysis indicates that socionatural trajectories that optimize resource use and address the socioeconomic needs of the community include the maintenance of palm/pastures associations.'

'Using logit techniques and data from surveys of the elderly conducted in 1984 under the auspices of the World Health Organization, this article investigates socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic determinants of living arrangements of the elderly. Having a spouse or children with whom to live has important effects on living arrangements. The results provide only weak support, however, for hypotheses based on modernization theory and point to the need for detailed data on transitions in living arrangements and for information about the younger generation as well as the older generation, both of which are involved in deciding who lives with whom.'

'Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses based on partial trnL intron sequences of 60 specimens of the Gondwanan liverwort family Pallaviciniaceae, and 23 representatives of other families of the Metzgeriidae, resolve the Pallaviciniaceae as monophyletic, albeit with low bootstrap support, with the Hymenophytaceae as their sistergroup in the likelihood tree. These data and further analyses of the Pallaviciniacean taxa only, based on the trnTUGU-trnLUAA spacer, trnLUAA 5\xe2\x80\xb2exon and trnLUAA intron of the chloroplast DNA and the ITS2 of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, support a separation of Moerckia (Moerckioideae) from the remaining genera. An unexpected close relationship between Podomitrium (Podomitrioideae) and the Symphyogynoideae is observed, whereas Pallavicinia and the Pallavicinioideae are polyphyletic. Within Symphyogyna, well-supported clades comprising the species with dendroid and prostrate-lobate thalli on the one hand and species with prostrate-undivided thalli on the other hand (except S. tenuinervis, including Symphyogynopsis) are distinguished. According to the molecular data, evolution of the dendroid life-form occurred three times independently in the Metzgeriidae, in Symphyogyna, Jensenia, and Hymenophyton.'

'The end of life represents a therapeutic context that acutely raises cultural and linguistic specificities, yet there is very little evidence illustrating the importance of such dynamics in shaping choices, trajectories and care practices. Culture and language interplay to offer considerable potential challenges to both patient and provider, with further work needed to explore patient and caregiver perspectives across cultures and linguistic groups, and provider perspectives. The objective of this study was to develop a critical, evidence-based understanding of the experiences of people from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) backgrounds, and their caregivers, in a palliative care setting.'

'A large and growing body of evidence indicates that dietary fatty acids regulate crucial metabolic processes involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD). Despite this evidence, optimal dietary fatty acid intakes for CHD prevention remain unclear. Significant gaps in the modern nutrition literature and contradictions in its interpretation have precluded broad consensus. These shortcomings can be addressed through the incorporation of evolutionary, historical, and global perspectives. The objective of this review is to propose a unified theory of optimal dietary fatty acid intake for CHD prevention that integrates critical insights from evolutionary, historical, global, and modern perspectives. This broad approach may be more likely than previous methods to characterize optimal fatty acid intakes.'

'We determined the population-based prevalence of diabetes mellitus in members of the Japanese community, Hisayama aged 40\xe2\x80\x9379 years old by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. The basic population used to calculate diabetic prevalence was 1,077 men (72.8% of the whole population in the same age range) and 1,413 women (80.8%) including ten diabetic patients on insulin therapy. In addition, we compared the prevalence of history of diabetes which was acquired by interview or questionnaire, between participants and non-participants in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, but they were not statistically different. The age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes to world population was 12.7% for men and 8.4% for women, and that of impaired glucose tolerance was 19.6% for men and 18.4% for women. These figures were much higher than those previously reported from several Japanese communities. The results obtained from the present study could reveal true prevalence of diabetes among the Japanese population. In addition, the reasons for the increasing prevalence of diabetes among the recent Japanese population are also discussed.'

'This article deals with houses and objects. Based on anthropological fieldwork on materiality in two well-off neighbourhoods in Denmark, the starting point are localisations of global flows in the privacy of houses. Filters and control showed out to be a major theme concerning the passages of things in and out of houses; these passages follow two rules: \xe2\x80\x9csomething in means something else out\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwhat comes in must be activated\xe2\x80\x9d. Openness and transparency showed out to be important themes concerning the house; there is a tendency towards large windows, few inner walls and large rooms, which are both poly-functional and poly-social. Furthermore, the filtering mechanisms for objects and the openness of the house are related to virtual flows from computers, telephones and televisions. Classical anthropological theories are used to understand this subject matter: the concept of haul (the spirit of the thing), exchange and social relations at large.'

Abstract not available

"The surface water of themarine environment has traditionally beenviewed as a nitrogen (N) limited habitat, andthis has guided the development of conceptualbiogeochemical models focusing largely on thereservoir of nitrate as the critical source ofN to sustain primary productivity. However,selected groups of Bacteria, includingcyanobacteria, and Archaea canutilize dinitrogen (N2) as an alternativeN source. In the marine environment, thesemicroorganisms can have profound effects on netcommunity production processes and can impactthe coupling of C-N-P cycles as well as the netoceanic sequestration of atmospheric carbondioxide. As one component of an integrated \xe2\x80\x98Nitrogen Transport and Transformations\xe2\x80\x99 project, we have begun to re-assess ourunderstanding of (1) the biotic sources andrates of N2 fixation in the world'soceans, (2) the major controls on rates ofoceanic N2 fixation, (3) the significanceof this N2 fixation for the global carboncycle and (4) the role of human activities inthe alteration of oceanic N2 fixation. Preliminary results indicate that rates ofN2 fixation, especially in subtropical andtropical open ocean habitats, have a major rolein the global marine N budget. Iron (Fe)bioavailability appears to be an importantcontrol and is, therefore, critical inextrapolation to global rates of N2fixation. Anthropogenic perturbations mayalter N2 fixation in coastal environmentsthrough habitat destruction and eutrophication,and open ocean N2 fixation may be enhancedby warming and increased stratification of theupper water column. Global anthropogenic andclimatic changes may also affect N2fixation rates, for example by altering dustinputs (i.e. Fe) or by expansion ofsubtropical boundaries. Some recent estimatesof global ocean N2 fixation are in therange of 100\xe2\x80\x93200 Tg N (1\xe2\x80\x932 \xc3\x97 1014 g N)yr\xe2\x88\x921, but have large uncertainties. Theseestimates are nearly an order of magnitudegreater than historical, pre-1980 estimates,but approach modern estimates of oceanicdenitrification."

"The Government of Papua New Guinea undertook a significant step in developing curriculum reform policy that promoted the use of Indigenous knowledge systems in teaching formal school subjects in any of the country's 800-plus Indigenous languages. The implementation of the Elementary Cultural Mathematics Syllabus is in line with the above curriculum emphasis. Given the aims of the reform, the research reported here investigated the influence of children's own mother tongue (Tok Ples) and traditional counting systems on their development of early number knowledge formally taught in schools. The study involved 272 school children from 22 elementary schools in four provinces. Each child participated in a task-based assessment interview focusing on eight task groups relating to early number knowledge. The results obtained indicate that, on average, children learning their traditional counting systems in their own language spent shorter time and made fewer mistakes in solving each task compared to those taught without Tok Ples (using English and/or the lingua franca, Tok Pisin). Possible reasons accounting for these differences are also discussed."

'Cultural explanations of psychopathology in the West have rarely employed models derived by anthropologists for small-scale non-literate communities. Some general features of those ritual patterns usually classed as \xe2\x80\x98culture-bound syndromes\xe2\x80\x99 are applicable to Western neurosis. Such reactions articulate both personal predicament and public concerns. usually core structural oppositions between age groups or the sexes. They gain their power. by relying on certain unquestionable assumptions which. although beyond everyday jural relationships, articulate such relationships. In the case of Western reactions, such \xe2\x80\x98mystical sanction\xe2\x80\x99 is provided by biomedicine. Theoretical paradigms emphasize either the individual pragmatic or expressive aspects, or social homeostasis.'

'Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance are associated with centrally-distributed obesity. These disturbances are especially prevalent in people of South Asian (Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi) descent. We examined the relationship of glucose intolerance to body fat pattern in a population survey of 2936 men and 537 women of South Asian and European origin living in London, UK. In both groups glucose intolerance (defined as diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance) was more strongly associated with waist-hip girth ratio than with skinfolds or body mass index. The associations between body mass index and glucose intolerance were fully accounted for by waist-hip ratio. In European men with normal glucose tolerance fasting insulin levels were more strongly correlated with body mass index than with waist-hip ratio. Physical activity scores were lower in South Asians than in Europeans but no statistically significant associations between glucose intolerance and low physical activity were detectable. Leisure-time physical activity scores were inversely correlated with 2 h insulin levels in both groups. In contrast with other studies these results suggest that a specific effect of intra-abdominal fat deposition underlies the association between glucose intolerance and obesity. The association between hyperinsulinaemia and obesity is less specific for centrally-distributed fat. When measured appropriately waist-hip ratio is the most valid anthropometric index for identifying individuals whose obesity predisposes them to glucose intolerance.'

'Editor Simon Anholt asked Jeremy Hildreth for his \xe2\x80\x98big picture\xe2\x80\x99 thoughts on the state of the place branding field \xe2\x80\x93 where it is, and where it might be going. This article employs many evocative metaphors to define and describe the benefits and hazards of place branding. The article takes the view that, broadly speaking, successful place branding results when certain mistakes are avoided and certain other challenges are imaginatively and thoughtfully resolved. The article proposes a generic, narrative meta-model of place branding, which any place may refer to regardless of the present level of development of its product, perception or promotion. Some of the tools of place branding \xe2\x80\x93 including graphic design, advertising, marketing communications, architecture and exports \xe2\x80\x93 are explored. And mention is made of the innovations and refinements that are needed in the near future, including cross-fertilization of the place branding discipline with insights from such fields as evolutionary science. The article concludes by likening the current state of place branding to an old map of the world, where the continents have all been discovered and are in the right places but some of the landmasses are misshapen and many are are still marked unexplored.'

'We developed a probabilistic seismic hazard map of Papua New Guinea expressed in terms of peak ground acceleration with return period of 475\xc2\xa0years. The calculations were performed for bedrock site conditions (Vs30\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0760\xc2\xa0m/s). A logic-tree framework was applied to include epistemic uncertainty in the seismic source as well as ground motion modelling processes. Two seismic source models were developed using area source zones and smoothed seismicity, respectively. Based on available geological and seismological data, defined seismic sources were classified into four different tectonic environments. For each of the tectonic regimes three ground motion prediction equations were selected and used to estimate the ground motions at a grid of sites with spacing of 0.1\xc2\xb0 in latitude and longitude. Results show a high level of hazard in the coastal areas of Huon Peninsula and New Britain\xe2\x80\x93Bougainville regions and a relatively low level of hazard in the southwestern part of Papua New Guinea. Seismic hazard disaggregation results show that in the Huon Peninsula region high seismic hazard is caused by modelled frequent moderate to large earthquakes occurring on the Ramu-Markham Fault Zone. In the New Britain\xe2\x80\x93Bougainville region the distance to the subduction zone associated with the New Britain Trench mainly controls the calculated level of hazard. It is also shown that the estimated level of peak ground acceleration is very sensitive to the selection of ground motion prediction equations. Overall our results differ significantly from those of previous studies, and we surmise that these differences are due to our use of modern ground motion prediction equations and earthquake source information.'

'A vulnerability analysis of c.300 unreinforced Masonry churches in New Zealand is presented. The analysis uses a recently developed vulnerability index method (Cattari et al. in Proceedings of the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering NZSEE 2015 conference, Rotorua, New Zealand, 2015a; b; SECED 2015 conference: earthquake risk and engineering towards a Resilient World, Cambridge; Goded et al. in Vulnerability analysis of unreinforced masonry churches (EQC 14/660)\xe2\x80\x94final report, 2016; Lagomarsino et al. in Bull Earthq Eng, 2018), specifically designed for New Zealand churches, based on a widely tested approach for European historical buildings. It consists of a macroseismic approach where the seismic hazard is defined by the intensity and correlated to post seismic damage. The many differences in typologies of New Zealand and European churches, with very simple architectural designs and a majority of one nave churches in New Zealand, justified the need to develop a method specifically created for this country. A statistical analysis of the churches damaged during the 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 Canterbury earthquake sequence was previously carried out to develop the vulnerability index modifiers for New Zealand churches. This new method has been applied to generate seismic scenarios for each church, based on the most likely seismic event for 500\xc2\xa0years return period, using the latest version of New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s National Seismic Hazard Model. Results show that highly vulnerable churches (e.g. stone churches and/or with a weak structural design) tend to produce higher expected damage even if the intensity level is lower than for less vulnerable churches in areas with slightly higher seismicity. The results of this paper provide a preliminary tool to identify buildings requiring in depth structural analyses. This paper is considered as a first step towards a vulnerability analysis of all the historical buildings in the country, in order to preserve New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s cultural and historical heritage.'

'Regional trade agreements (RTAs) are usually classified according to their form into four broad categories: preferential arrangements, free trade agreements, customs unions and common markets. This paper investigates whether the form/depth of RTAs matters concerning their effect on trade. I use a proper specification of the gravity model with panel data on the 1960\xe2\x80\x932000 period, which specifically control for self-selection into agreements. Results show that creating any kind of RTAs providing trade preferences to their member countries significantly increases bilateral trade. Nevertheless, their average treatment effect on bilateral trade does not significantly differ according to the depth of agreements.'
