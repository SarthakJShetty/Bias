Abstract: 'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the \xe2\x80\x98ecological units\xe2\x80\x99 with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR (1\xe2\x80\x934) through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.'

Abstract: 'Spatially explicit approach is essential to prioritise the ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. In the present study, the conservation status of 20 protected areas of the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, was analysed based on long-term changes in forests (1975\xe2\x80\x931985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005\xe2\x80\x932013), landscape level changes in fragmentation and forest fires (2005\xe2\x80\x932015). This study has shown that a significant forest loss occurred in protected areas before declaration. Idukki is one of the major protected areas which showed a drastic reduction (18.83%) in its forest cover. During 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, Periyar tiger reserve had lost 24.19\xc2\xa0km2 core 3 forest area followed by Peppara (18.54\xc2\xa0km2), Parambikulam (17.93\xc2\xa0km2), Chimmony (17.71\xc2\xa0km2), Peechi-Vazhani (12.31\xc2\xa0km2) and Neyyar (11.67\xc2\xa0km2). An area of 71.33\xc2\xa0km2 of the protected area was affected by fires in 2014. Overall protected area-wise decadal analysis indicates Periyar has the highest number of fire incidences followed by Wayanad, Kurinjimala, Silent Valley and Eravikulam. Disturbances in the form of fires and fragmentation still exist and may have significant conservation threat to flora and fauna. Among protected areas, many are having a probability to go under threat or dynamic stage. Chinnar, Thattekkad and Kurinjimala sanctuaries are representing high levels of vulnerability, or they are near to decline stage. Habitat level monitoring of the anthropogenic disturbances can be efficiently useful for the strategic conservation planning. The present study has provided geospatial database on spatial patterns of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in protected areas of Kerala. Conservation prioritization approach based on these parameters will be useful for the strategic planning in the state of Kerala.'

Abstract: 'Sacred areas are the oldest form of habitat protection, and many of these areas contribute to biodiversity conservation. While sacred groves have received considerable scholarly attention, little is known about fresh water swamps in the Western Ghats, India and sacred swamps have largely been ignored. This paper provides a first overview testing the conjecture that sacred swamps have physical features that distinguish them from non-sacred swamps. We assessed 110 fresh water swamps in the district of Uttara Kannada, Central Western Ghats, India, through extensive field surveys. Out of them 11 swamps are \xe2\x80\x98sacred\xe2\x80\x99 according to local testimony. Swamps are found in wet evergreen and evergreen forest types, but sacred swamps occur only in the wet evergreen forests. Sacred swamps differ significantly from non-sacred swamps with respect to size and shape, distance to the nearest road, human settlement, and commercial orchard, and population density within a radius of 500\xc2\xa0m. This shows that preferentially swamps close to settlements, orchards and roads have been declared as sacred, probably to regulate the continuing provision of relevant ecosystem services. While we find a variety of deities associated with these sacred swamps, the practices associated with sacred swamp status and management are essentially the same across belief groups. However, the conservation practice is at risk due to migration dynamics.'

Abstract: 'The Western Ghats forms an important watershed for the entire peninsular India, being the source of 37 west flowing rivers and three major east flowing rivers and their numerous tributaries. However, deforestation due to large scale land cover changes has affected the water sustenance in the region evident from the quantity and duration of water availability during post monsoon period. Land use Land cover changes accelerated by unplanned anthropogenic activities have been the prime mover of global warming and consequent changes in the climate. This necessitates appropriate resource management with an understanding of drivers. Geo-visualization of landscape transitions considering the influential agents will aid in formulating strategies to mitigate global warming. Uttara Kannada district in the Central Western Ghats has the distinction of having highest forest cover in the country and this region is now experiencing rapid forest cover changes. Factors inducing changes in the land cover are normalized through fuzzyfication, considered for Multi criteria Evaluation using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) under high protection and low protection scenarios. Likely land use transitions by 2022 across zones based on transitions during 2004\xe2\x80\x932007, 2007\xe2\x80\x932010, 2010\xe2\x80\x932013 was done through cellular automata and Markov chain process (MC). The analyses highlight the loss of forest cover by 66.55\xe2\x80\x9356.76% by 2022 in the coastal zone with escalating population density. Similar situation of 65.98\xe2\x80\x9355.62% decline in Sahyadri region is noticed with execution of dams, hydroelectric projects and monoculture plantations. Lower transitions as compared with the second scenario highlights regulatory framework\xe2\x80\x99s role in protection. However, forests in plain region show loss of 27.38\xe2\x80\x9311.09% in both scenarios due to population pressure and market induced land cover changes. This necessitates policy interventions by the federal government to mitigate forest loss towards sustainable development.'

Author: 'Jagmohan\xc2\xa0Sharma'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11027-015-9659-7
Abstract: 'Assessment of vulnerability is an important step in building long-term resilience in the forestry sector. The objective of this paper is to present a methodological approach to assess inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level. The approach involves use of vulnerability indicators, the pairwise comparison method, and geographic information system (GIS) tools. We apply this approach to assess the inherent vulnerability of forests of the Western Ghats Karnataka (WGK) landscape, which is a part of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. Four vulnerability indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope, are selected. We find that forests in 30, 36, 19, and 15\xc2\xa0% grid points in this region show low, medium, high, and very high inherent vulnerability, respectively. The forest showing high and very high inherent vulnerability are mostly dry deciduous forests and plantations located largely on the eastern side of the landscape. We also find that canopy cover is one of the key indicators that determine the inherent vulnerability of forests, and natural forests are inherently less vulnerable than man-made plantations. Spatial assessment of inherent vulnerability of forests at landscape level is particularly useful for developing strategies to build resilience to current stressors and climate change in future.'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity and ecosystem services play key roles in future economic strategies seeking to promote development and prosperity. This study assesses the status of biodiversity and flow of ecosystem services from selected forest types in the Western Ghats. At the sampling sites, the number of tree species ranged from 16 to 79 per hectare depending on the forest type. The estimates for Shannon\xe2\x80\x93Wiener index for trees in the evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forest plots were 3.02, 2.9 and 1.54, respectively. The total biomass carbon stocks in evergreen, moist deciduous and dry deciduous forests in the study area was 229, 221 and 189\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0C/ha, respectively. Analysis of dependency patterns of local communities on forest resources indicated a high dependency on provisional services such as fuelwood, manure and fodder. The study records the highest dependency rates for fuelwood, ranging between 72 and 100% for the three forest types and indicates that forest ecosystems underpin the well-being of the population dependent directly and indirectly on them.'

The study was carried out in Agasthyamalai Biosphere reserve, Western Ghats, India. Multi-temporal satellite images from 1973 to 2012 were utilized to map the areas of occurrence of the species. The largest areal extent of the species was calculated to be 111.65\xc2\xa0km2 in the recent time, at which the invasion process reached its saturation phase. The species was found to be a generalist, with no preferred inclination towards any particular topographic or climatic zone. Evergreen forests were established to be its closest associate with largest area followed by semi evergreen and moist deciduous forests within buffer distances of 100, 200 and 500\xc2\xa0m. A threatening 20.8\xc2\xa0% of evergreen forests were revealed to have been converted to pure reed bamboos. Overlay analysis showed the oldest and the newest surviving patches of pure reed bamboos in the landscape of Agasthyamalai. The study realizes the significance of remote sensing and GIS in mapping and monitoring of invasive species. We suggest periodical monitoring of reed bamboo areas to check its growth, spread and establishment in order to ensure conservation of Western Ghats.'

Title: 'Exploring the Ecological History of a Tropical Agroforestry Landscape Using Fossil Pollen and Charcoal Analysis from Four Sites in Western Ghats, India'
Author: 'Sandra\xc2\xa0Nogu\xc3\xa9'

Abstract: 'Contrary to expectations, some human-modified landscapes are considered to sustain both human activities and biodiversity over the long-term. Agroforestry systems are among these landscapes where crops are planted under native shade trees. In this context, ancient agroforestry systems can provide insight into how farmers managed the landscape over time. Such insight can help to quantify the extent to which tropical forests (especially habitat-specialist trees) are responding to local and landscape-level management. Here, we extracted fossil pollen (indicator of past vegetation changes) and macroscopic charcoal (indicator of biomass burning) from four forest hollows\xe2\x80\x99 sedimentary sequences in an ancient agroforestry system in Western Ghats, India. We used a mixed-modelling approach and a principal components analysis (PCA) to determine past trajectories of forest change and species composition dynamics for the last 900\xc2\xa0years. In addition, we reconstructed the long-term forest canopy dynamics and examined the persistence of habitat-specialist trees over time. Our results show that the four sites diverged to a surprising degree in both taxa composition and dynamics. However, despite these differences, forest has persisted over 900\xc2\xa0years under agricultural activities within agroforestry systems. This long-term analysis highlights the importance of different land-use legacies as a framework to increase the effectiveness of management across tropical agricultural lands.'

Author: 'Kanchan\xc2\xa0Chopra'

Abstract: 'Environmental movements replace deliberation and adjudication by the language of rights, livelihoods or value systems. They usually bring together like-minded stakeholders on issues of common interest. Drawing from the documentation for India, this chapter addresses the following issues: What role can such environmental movements play in the formulation of policy and through what channels? Further, what role have they played in the last three decades in India? Significant environmental movements are analysed from the viewpoint of the impact they have had. Further, impact is defined in three ways, each of which has the potential of initiating an iterative process that influences decision-making in the future. An immediate impact could be in terms of an act passed by the parliament or an executive order influencing the project at hand. Alternatively, impact may be on sectoral policy or the manner in which future projects are evaluated or granted approval. Finally, a change in the macro policy environment could occur which results in a mainstreaming of environmental issues.'

Author: 'Deepak\xc2\xa0Rajpurohit'
URL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-0060-7_8
Abstract: 'The efficient conservation and judicious use of plant genetic resources and related traditional knowledge is vital for food, health, and nutritional security. Plant genetic diversity available in gene banks, in the wild, and in farmer\xe2\x80\x99s fields is crucial resource for food, health, and nutritional security, augmenting livelihoods and environmental services. These resources could support acclimatization of primary food crops to climate change impacts. In pursuit of improved cereal, pulse, horticultural, medicinal, aromatic, and other cash crop varieties suitable for particular agroecosystem, availability of a diversity of alleles/genes in terms of yield, quality, resistance against disease and pest, and tolerance for drought, heat, salt, and water in the wild relatives, indigenous, local land races, and farmer cultivars is the prime prerequisite, which limits the options for sustainable resilient agriculture management. To prevent their genetic erosion, a well-devised strong linkage between in situ resource conservation, collection and ex situ conservation in gene banks and their utilization for genetic improvement through research and breeding is required for their subsequent availability to farmer, pharmaceutical and seed community. Conserving plant genetic resources in situ as well as ex situ ensures efficient explorations in order to implement the International Treaty and Global Plan of Action on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. These collections are valuable genetic resource of resistance to diseases and pests, tolerance to climatic stresses, and improved targeted \xe2\x80\x9ctrait\xe2\x80\x9d through crop improvement and assurance against genetic erosion. It is important to support in situ/on-farm conservation of agroecosystems because ex situ conservation cannot replicate the evolutionary processes and cultural practices but can act as crucial reservoir to safeguard them from calamities.'

Title: 'Biodiversity resilience in the Central Indian Highlands is contingent on maintaining and recovering landscape connectivity: the tiger as a case study'
Author: 'John\xc2\xa0Seidensticker'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-015-0846-6
Abstract: 'Corridors (variably called landscape linkages, connectors, and gateways) are expanses of a landscape that facilitate the flow or movement of individuals, genes, and ecological processes. Protected areas with their buffer zones and the corridors that connect them are cornerstones of modern conservation actions to maintain the biodiversity we have and restore what we have lost. Policy and governance to guide the establishment and management of protected areas and supporting buffer zones is well established in the Central Indian Highlands. A policy and governance structure to create the context and enabling conditions for corridor maintenance, creation, and recovery is emerging but is constrained by the reigning land-management paradigm that separates conservation from development rather than mainstreaming species and habitat conservation into the rural development agenda. Well-nourished, healthy human populations and healthy ecosystems are inextricably linked. The worsening ecological conditions in the Central Indian Highlands can trigger the emergence of a common agenda for an inclusive, caring, and environment-friendly mode of development. The alternative is the business-as-usual scenario: a continuation of worsening ecological conditions. Entry points through the biodiversity, agriculture production, resource extraction, and economic/social sectors to enable integrated sustainable landscape management are identified. These include deepening what it means to successfully conserve a species combined with explicit threat analysis for at-risk tigers and the landscapes that supports them; landscape scenario modeling to advance communication by synthesizing diverse forms of research and articulating and evaluating alternative socio-economic futures; and the use of the smart green infrastructure process as an approach to development rather than only as a way to mitigate environmental damage. Models are presented to scale up from isolated conservation interventions to collective impact that unites supportive government partners with individuals, NGOs, and economic interests to achieve viable long-term relationships in human and natural systems to value, maintain, and recover landscape connectivity.'

Abstract: 'The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is one of the successful international treaties that is steadily progressing with the realization of its stated objectives. Conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of biological resources and equitable sharing of benefits with the people for utilization of their traditional knowledge and resources are gaining global acceptance. When the CBD addresses the larger issues of global biodiversity conservation and utilization of biological resources for developmental purposes, the specific problems concerning biosafety brought out by biotechnology, and access and benefit sharing are left to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing, respectively. The Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress emerging out of living modified organisms is the latest addition under the CBD. India, being one of the oldest surviving civilizations with indigenous people and their wisdom and as one of the megadiverse countries, has high stakes in conserving biological diversity and protecting the traditional knowledge base of its indigenous and local communities. India has many domestic legal and policy instruments to govern biodiversity and biosafety issues. This chapter critically looks at the international legal obligations for India under the CBD as well as the Cartagena Protocol, Nagoya Protocol and the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol and evaluates the level of their domestic implementation in India. Recently, the Government of India has ratified both the Protocols under the CBD, and many changes are expected in the domestic regulatory frameworks. This chapter will examine the effectiveness of existing domestic regulatory mechanisms and the alternative options available to India in implementing the CBD and its Protocols.\n'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity is integral to the direct benefits that humans receive from nature besides ecosystem services. However, human activities and the negative consequences of climate change are accelerating the loss of biodiversity. There are multiple indications of continuing decline in biodiversity in all three of its components\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 ecosystems, species and genes. In order to receive continuous ecosystem services and protect the species from extinction, 35 global biodiversity hotspots have been identified for conservation. It is nothing but a biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened with destruction. The tropical island of Andaman and Nicobar is part of the global biodiversity hotspot having a large number of flora and fauna besides exhibiting great endemism. The recent assessment showed that the plant diversity of these islands comprises 3219 species under 1251 genera belonging to angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes, bryophytes, lichens and algae. Similarly 1463 species of fishes, 600\xc2\xa0species of corals, 120 species of sponges, 290\xc2\xa0species of butterflies, 300\xc2\xa0species of birds and 36\xc2\xa0species of mangroves were\xc2\xa0recorded. They are imperative for the livelihood of local people, a treasure for humankind; therefore, efforts should be made to strengthen the conservation efforts and preservation of threatened floral and faunal diversity of these islands.'

Abstract: 'This chapter argues that at the heart of social innovation for environmental sustainability are the issues of space, scale, and power, which present themselves in the form of various puzzles, especially when approached in the context of climate change. Since communities are the basic building blocks of \xe2\x80\x9csocial\xe2\x80\x9d they remain central to \xe2\x80\x9csocial innovation.\xe2\x80\x9d Taking as its key examples the Indian Sundarbans in the Bay of Bengal and Zhangjiangkou Mangrove Forestry National Nature Reserve in Yunxiao county of Fujian province of China, the chapter shows how communities located on sites characterized by multiple marginalities (geographical, socioeconomic, and cultural) perceive and approach impacts of environmental unsustainability and incremental climate change in both material-physical and ideational-representational terms. Environmental sustainability, both on land and at sea, is unlikely to be realized in the absence of a pursuit of social innovation through a micro-geopolitics of resistance anchored in participatory democracy and environmental-social justice.'

Abstract: 'Cultural and natural heritages are increasingly threatened by destruction, not only from natural causes but also as the results of anthropogenic interventions. From India, 32 properties are enlisted in the World Heritage list (2015), but the Ghats of Varanasi have not yet been proposed for inclusion, mostly because of political complexity and the lack of strong movement from the stakeholders. This chapter attempts to critically examine the rationales for proposing Varanasi as a heritage city in the World Heritage list and the problems faced in this process in the past 12 years. In this context, the status of Varanasi on the scale of the UNESCO World Heritage list, the implications of the past and ongoing Master Plans and City Development Plan, the role of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) (Varanasi), governance strategies, and issues of public awareness are critically examined. It is suggested that under the auspices of City Administration a Heritage & Conservation Cell in the Development Authority and Municipal Corporation should be created, and specific by-laws formulated for the development and preservation of heritagescapes with active participation from stakeholders.'

Abstract: 'Biological diversity, defined as the variety and variability within species, between species and ecosystems, is crucial to poverty alleviation and sustainable development. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) recognises that biological diversity is about more than plants, animals and microorganisms and their ecosystems \xe2\x80\x93 it is about people and our need for food security, medicines, fresh air and water, shelter and a clean and healthy environment in which to live. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is viewed as an umbrella concept, which includes corporate citizenship, corporate sustainability, stakeholder management, environmental management, business ethics and corporate social performance. The chapter deals with case studies of Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) in different aspects from research to commercialisation and the contributions of corporate sector to biodiversity conservation, sustainable use and fair and equitable sharing of benefits. The contributions of corporate sector in India for promoting sustainable development and livelihood are presented.'

Title: 'Is ecotourism a panacea? Political ecology perspectives from the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India'

Abstract: 'Ecotourism is increasingly being promoted as an instrument that helps local socio-economic development and generate revenues to strengthen conservation of critically endangered biodiversity. It is often posited the magic bullet particularly across protected areas in the Global South. In theory, ecotourism can provide economic benefits to economically weaker communities living around protected areas and inspire them to protect the biodiversity in their own interest. This paper, however, provides empirical evidence that the so-called win\xe2\x80\x93win is not an unqualified truism. With a case study on Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, world\xe2\x80\x99s largest mangrove biodiversity and home of highly endangered Royal Bengal Tiger, this article examines complexities involved in ecotourism and urges the need to make it context-specific. It assesses ecotourism\xe2\x80\x99s ability to provide livelihood alternatives to local communities and how can it help in conservation. The findings demonstrate an unequal, uneven, and skewed accumulation of benefits of ecotourism, often associated with market mechanisms of global environmental protection. As little as 36% of the interviewees claimed receiving direct or indirect benefits from ecotourism, the study finds. It failed to offer any benefits at all to the poorest and most marginal communities. On the contrary, it offered disproportionately larger returns to the remotely located capital invested in the local ecotourism facilities in the Sundarbans, thus defeating the principle behind the mechanism. In the area of conservation, tourism was blamed for increasing pollution and harming the health of the ecosystem by tourists who were considered \xe2\x80\x98outsiders\xe2\x80\x99 and insensitive to the ecology by the locals and conservation agencies alike.'

Abstract: 'Land and forest resources have been at the centre of several policy interventions in India over a long period of time: policy declarations, acts and rules as well as incentivising and restraining tax and subsidy structures. Field reality observed by social scientists and their natural science counterparts has also been documented extensively in the last three to four decades. The questions we ask in this chapter are: Has the policy direction been impacted by the understandings from this literature? What is the empirical learning policy link? Who are the stakeholders who count?'

Abstract: 'THE WORLD\xe2\x80\x99S FEW REMAINING protected ecosystems are becoming progressively threatened from human exploitation. They are also under threat from a new polemic, namely that protected areas have failed to adequately safeguard native ecologies and biota and are unlikely to do any better in the future. In contrast, it is argued that ecosystems in human-dominated landscapes are stable and have been for a long time; it is there that we must concentrate future conservation efforts even at the expense of protected areas. A recent debate in conservation biology urges society to move away from the protected area paradigm and to focus on altered landscapes outside parks, which are being taken over and modified by humans. While we recognize that new approaches to conservation are needed in a world of burgeoning human numbers, this does not mean that protected areas have no crucial function. The debate surrounding protected areas begs three important questions: First, do protected areas play a role in conservation that is not achieved in human ecosystems? Second, and if so, why are protected areas not achieving their goals and how can this be rectified? And third, how can human-dominated ecosystems contribute to conservation objectives; in particular, can protected areas and human-dominated areas support each other?'

Abstract: 'This chapter explores a series of personal narratives among migrant settlers situated at the centre of a contested conservation landscape in Kerala, India. Facing starvation and unemployment associated with World War II, impoverished villagers from the plains of Travancore were encouraged by the State to move to its eastern mountain frontier. There they faced an impenetrable forest and the unwelcome presence of crop-raiding elephants. Settler remembrances of this period are dominated by articulations about daily elephant raids and by repeated references to famine. This study shows that memory born out of collective distress plays an important role in how migrant societies reflect on their lives, construct their identity, respond to exigencies and effect land use change. Alongside an analysis of non-human agency and memory, they serve as invaluable tools in understanding contemporary conflicts around conservation.'

Abstract: 'Conventional measures of national income and wealth do not account for environmental and social costs of development. Therefore, they may mislead long-term economic forecasts for an economy. It is therefore necessary to develop a system of accounting of natural resources, which is likely to provide ample support to design the economic system, in such way that it is possible to attain economic growth without destroying natural resources. Hence, the concept of green accounting has increasingly been accepted and promoted by national and international organizations. This system of greening our accounts would provide an improved parameter of measuring development as compared to GDP growth alone. Green GDP shall measure sustainability of development and would be an appropriate and valuable decision-making aid in economic planning. The study discusses the accounting framework for forestry accounting in the context of SEEA and provides the framework and methodology for compilation of forestry accounts. It attempts on economic valuation of few ecosystem services, viz. carbon sequestration, soil conservation, water recharge, water purification and pollination and seed dispersal services from the forests of Karnataka, India. The study also highlights the \xe2\x80\x98glaring lack of data\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98standardized methodologies\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98standardized accounting units\xe2\x80\x99 for ascribing an economic value to intangible services deriving from forest resource as the main reason for it not being included in the accounting part of conventional GDP.'

Abstract: 'The tubers of wild yams (Dioscorea) form an important source of starchy food, which is consumed by the tribal inhabitants living dependent with the forest. Kerala, India, has a rich diversity of Dioscorea with unique properties, contributing to both food and health security needs of the local communities, especially the tribal communities. This chapter describes the diversity of wild Dioscorea that are found in Kerala part of Western Ghats and that are distinguished based on the morpho-taxonomic characters. Wayanad district has about 22 different taxa of Dioscorea, of which 21 are edible and serve as vital food during famine months to forest-dwelling tribes. For classification of wild Dioscorea folk system relies chiefly on the use classes of tubers such as edibility, taste, colour of the flesh, size, direction of growth, fibre content, cooking properties and occasionally its number. A folk taxonomic classification system has been devised by the user communities like Kattunaikka, Muduga and Paniya for the optimum utilization of various Dioscorea taxa.'

Title: 'Quantification and monitoring of deforestation in India over eight decades (1930\xe2\x80\x932013)'
Author: 'C.\xc2\xa0Sudhakar Reddy'

Abstract: 'There is still large uncertainty over the status of global forest cover owing to the paucity of comprehensive and holistic studies related to long term forest cover change. The aim of the present work is to prepare a nation-wide multi-date forest cover database which describes and quantifies historical and recent changes in natural forests of India. This analysis facilitated the determination of the state of Indian forest cover changes over last eight decades. Here, we have mapped the total area under forest cover, evaluated the spatial tracking of changes in natural forests, estimated the rate of deforestation and afforestation, analysed the biogeographic zone wise and state wise forest cover change, existing land use in deforested area, influence of environmental factors such as terrain on deforestation and implication of different definitions of forest used by agencies reporting deforestation in India. The results indicated that forests covered an area of 869,012\xc2\xa0km2 in 1930 which has decreased to 625,565\xc2\xa0km2 in 2013, a net loss of 243,447\xc2\xa0km2 (28\xc2\xa0%) in eight decades. The highest annual average forest loss was found to be 4795\xc2\xa0km2 during 1930\xe2\x80\x931975, 1476\xc2\xa0km2 during 1975\xe2\x80\x931985, 767\xc2\xa0km2 during 1985\xe2\x80\x931995, 356\xc2\xa0km2 during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 209\xc2\xa0km2 during 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. Between 1930 and 1975, forest experienced large scale deforestation at gross annual rate of 0.77\xc2\xa0% which has declined to 0.29\xc2\xa0% and 0.14\xc2\xa0% for the 1975\xe2\x80\x931985 and 1985\xe2\x80\x931995 periods respectively. Quantification of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.07\xc2\xa0% during 1995\xe2\x80\x932005 and 0.05\xc2\xa0% during 2005\xe2\x80\x932013. The lower rates of deforestation during recent period support effectiveness of conservation measures taken at national level. It was found that deforestation rate has decreased in many biogeographic zones by 2005, except for Andaman & Nicobar Islands and North East. The major deforestation has mostly occurred due to conversion of forests to agriculture. The construction of reservoirs contributed to 4.1\xc2\xa0% of forest loss. The tropical forests have experienced large scale deforestation followed by subtropical forests. The findings of the study will be useful to prioritize conservation and protection of forest cover at the regional level. It shall also provide a base for future research on the impacts of deforestation on carbon flux and biodiversity.'

Abstract: 'Wild or cultivated plants used in traditional and modern medicines are categorized as medicinal plants (MPs). Out of over 70,000 MPs, 3000 are traded and 900 are cultivated. Fragmentation/loss of habitats, unsustainable harvests, excessive grazing, invasive species, pollution, and climate change are destroying genetic diversity. Regular use of MPs in modern medicines, consumer/industrial merchandises, and increasing popularity of complementary and alternate (CAM) therapies are expanding national/global trade inciting irrational wild collections beyond regeneration potential of wild populations consequently losing species and genetic diversity. Investigations on endangered species indicated frightening levels of genetic erosion and dwindling population densities/sizes below minimum viable limits. Only a small fraction of known MPs have been evaluated for their genetic diversity and genetic erosion. Morphoagronomic, biochemical and molecular marker, and enzyme studies on wild and cultivated genotypes, populations, species, and geographical regions revealed genetic diversity with varied levels of polymorphism (14\xe2\x80\x93100\xc2\xa0%), number of alleles (2\xe2\x80\x9314/locus), observed (0.0\xe2\x80\x931.0) and expected (0.06\xe2\x80\x930.84) heterozygosities, Nei\xe2\x80\x99s gene diversity (0.12\xe2\x80\x930.36), Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s index (0.08\xe2\x80\x930.51), gene flow (0.22\xe2\x80\x934.69), genetic distances (0.02\xe2\x80\x930.54), and similarities (0.02\xe2\x80\x930.98). Recovery, conservation, and cultivation programs initiated by governments have slowed down genetic erosion. Cultivation helped in relieving harvest pressure on wild flora and in preserving genetic diversity of some species. Existence of large number of species, paucity of adequate research funds, loss/degradation of forests, ever increasing local/world demand, genetic resource utilization with benefit sharing, and patent conflicts are the concerns that need to be resolved for conserving genetic diversity and preventing genetic erosion.'

Author: 'Mahesh\xc2\xa0Sankaran'
URL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-7570-0_8
Abstract: 'Grazing and fire are processes that are integral to savannas and grasslands worldwide. However, very few studies have evaluated the effects of fire and grazing on community and ecosystem processes in savannas and grasslands in the Indian context. Here, I report results from an experimental study that investigated the individual and interactive effects of grazing and fire on community and ecosystem level processes in mesic tall-grass savannas of the southern Western Ghats, India. Burning had no effect on species richness or composition of herbaceous plant communities in these grasslands,\xc2\xa0and within 2\xc2\xa0years following burning vegetative cover in burnt plots was indistinguishable from unburned plots. Grazing treatments, on the other hand, significantly reduced the relative abundance of the dominant tall-grass species Cymbopogon flexuosus in plots, resulting in a concomitant increase in herbaceous plant species richness relative to unburned plots. At the ecosystem level, grazers did not enhance soil N availability and N turnover rates in this mesic tall-grass savanna, which is most likely a consequence of the low herbivore densities in the study area. Burning, on the other hand, resulted in greater soil N availability in plots at the start of the growing season, but such effects were short-lived and did not persist. Interestingly, greater soil N availability in burnt plots appeared to be a consequence of lowered N uptake by plants, associated with lower plant\xc2\xa0biomass in burned plots, rather than an increase in N mineralization rates in soils. Results from this study suggest that tall-grass communities dominated by C. flexuosus are quite stable with respect to perturbations by fire. However, grazers, when coupled with fire, have the potential to significantly enhance species richness and induce plant compositional shifts  in this mesic tall-grass savanna, particularly when grazing intensity is high.'

Abstract: 'The coastal zone is the area covered by coastal waters and the adjacent shore lands, strongly influenced by each other. Coastal lands are some of the most productive and invaluable habitats of the biosphere, including estuaries, lagoons, and coastal wetlands. They are a place of high-priority interest to people, commerce, military, and to a variety of industries. Because it contains a dense population, the coast undergoes environmental modification and deterioration through reclamation, dredging, pollution, industry, and anthropogenic activities.'

Title: 'Role of Wildlife Protected Areas in India'

Abstract: 'Global biodiversity is disappearing at an alarming rate. Habitat loss, fragmentation, habitat degradation, direct pressures like hunting and other extractive human uses are all contributing to the loss of biodiversity, which in turn are leading to the loss of vital ecosystem services. Different conservation strategies have been proposed for arresting this loss of biodiversity in tropical countries, through establishment of protected areas of various types. In India, a model based on \xe2\x80\x98wildlife preservation\xe2\x80\x99 under state ownership of protected areas is predominant. However, alternative models based on community ownership and sustainable resource use by local people are also being advocated for preserving biodiversity. However, a practical problem in evaluating such broad, generic alternative models of wildlife is that these are not locally context-specific or sufficiently evidence-based. We examined human impacts on different forms of biodiversity under different levels of local access, degree of state protection and legal and illegal resource extraction regimes in a conservation landscape in Nagarahole, southern India. We applied current and rigorous sampling, modeling and estimation approaches to assess the status of three components of biodiversity, namely plants, birds and mammals, across three ecologically similar areas that differed only in terms of access and human impact characteristics. Different levels of human disturbance and environmental variables altered species composition, richness, diversity and abundance of plants, birds and mammals. These impacts were generally negative on a wide range of taxonomic groups. Estimated values of species richness and abundance of plants and birds were higher for highly protected and moderately protected areas compared to least protected areas. Strict protected areas were particularly important for galliformes and omnivores, while moderately protected areas were important for insectivores, granivores and insecti-frugivores, amongst birds. We also showed that the loss of bird guilds have serious consequences on seed dispersal, forest growth and regeneration. Abundance estimates for terrestrial mammals were substantially higher for highly protected and moderately protected areas. These differences were particularly evident for arboreal mammals.

Abstract: 'Agroforestry is as old as agriculture itself. Many of the anecdotal agroforestry practices, which are time tested and evolved through traditional indigenous knowledge, are still being followed in different agroecological zones. The traditional knowledge and the underlying ecological principles concerning indigenous agroforestry systems around the world have been successfully used in designing the improved systems. Many of them such as improved fallows, homegardens, and park systems have evolved as modern agroforestry systems. During past four decades, agroforestry has come of age and begun to attract the attention of the international scientific community, primarily as a means for sustaining agricultural productivity in marginal lands and solving the second-generation problems such as secondary salinization due to waterlogging and contamination of water resources due to the use of excess nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides. Research efforts have shown that most of the degraded areas including saline, waterlogged, and perturbation ecologies like mine spoils and coastal degraded mangrove areas can be made productive by adopting suitable agroforestry techniques involving highly remunerative components such as plantation-based farming systems, high-value medicinal and aromatic plants, livestock, fishery, poultry, forest and fruit trees, and vegetables. New concepts such as integrated farming systems and urban and peri-urban agroforestry have emerged. Consequently, the knowledge base of agroforestry is being expanded at a rapid pace as illustrated by the increasing number and quality of scientific publications of various forms on different aspects of agroforestry. It is both a challenge and an opportunity to scientific community working in this interdisciplinary field. In order to prepare themselves better for facing future challenges and seizing the opportunities, scientists need access to synthesized information and develop technologies to assess the environmental benefits we get from different agroforestry services. The global community is still only in the beginning phase to recognize the potential benefits of many underexploited systems to address the most intractable land management problems of the twenty-first century, such as food and nutrient security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems. As we move forward to vigorously exploit these potential benefits, we will witness the involvement of agroforestry and its progress for solving these problems and be able to ensure food and environmental security at global level.'

Abstract: 'Our ancestors always considered plant genetic resources (PGR) to be the heritage of humankind and were of the opinion that this treasure would provide the foundation for attaining food, nutritional, and health security. Though evolution on Earth started over 3.5\xc2\xa0billion years ago, it is with human interference, coupled with natural processes, that biodiversity has expanded. Human civilization is closely associated with the refinement of biodiversity. Looking to their day-to-day needs, humans started selecting plants from the available natural biodiversity. In ancient times, when men used to go hunting, it was women who developed the art of gathering and selecting plant species according to the needs of the family/society. Along with the advance of civilization, a natural evolutionary adjustment process took place in nature, of course aligned with human interference in different ecologies and changing environmental and biotic conditions. The resultant plant biodiversity was an irreplaceable resource and was the lifeline of humans, providing a sustainable ecosystem to meet the food, clothing, shelter, nutritional, and health requirements of the population. Among developing countries, India is considered as a cradle of agricultural biodiversity, known for its rich heritage of plant, animal, and fish genetic resources, as well as microorganisms, which constitute biodiversity. With 17% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population, only 4.0% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s area, and 40% of its water bodies, India is considered to be one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 17 mega biodiversity countries, with 12 of the world\xe2\x80\x99s mega-diversity centers, accounting for 7\xe2\x80\x938% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s recorded species. India is also considered as a major center for the domestication of crop plants. Among the 34 biodiversity hot spots identified across the world\xe2\x80\x94which are largely superimposed over the phyto-geographical regions\xe2\x80\x94the Indian Gene Centre has three: the Western Himalayas, North-Eastern region, and Western Ghats. The Indian Gene Centre is divided into eight regions, including biodiversity-rich zones. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are rich treasure houses of agro-biodiversity and are connected with Indo-Burman, Indo-Malyasian, and Indo-Indonesian biodiversity. The Indian Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Rights (PPV&FRA) Authority has identified 22 agro-biodiversity hotspots across the country. Looking to the rich biodiversity of the country, Vavilov (1951) identified India as one of the eight primary centers of the origin of cultivated plants; the country hosts about 49,000 species of flowering and nonflowering plants (18.8%), out of 260,000 described across the globe. India is rich in endemic plant species, which represent 33% of its flora. Within the spectrum of crop species and wild relatives, thousands of varieties, cultivars, landraces, and ecotypes occur in India. The country is known to have more than 18,000 species of higher plants, including 160 major and minor crop species and 325 wild relatives. Around 1500 wild edible plant species are widely exploited by native tribes. In addition, nearly 9500 plant species with ethno-botanical uses have been reported in the country, of which around 7500 are used for ethno-medical purposes and 3900 are edible species. Medicinal plants account for nearly 3000 species (India\xe2\x80\x99s 4th national report to the Convention on Biological Diversity [CBD] 2009).'

Abstract: 'UNESCO Natural World Heritage Sites (WHSs) are some of the most important biophysical and geological places on Earth, yet nearly half are endangered or face considerable risks from ever-expanding human impacts. Often sites have people living within or nearby who speak different languages, many of which are unique and similarly endangered. Here we examine the co-occurrence of Natural WHSs with languages, as a key index of cultural diversity, to identify locations for integrative conservation opportunities aimed at protecting human and non-human diversity. Our analysis reveals many WHSs with high linguistic diversity, as well as endangered sites with associated indigenous languages and endangered languages that intersect Natural WHSs. Results identify Australia as the continent which has the greatest number of Natural WHSs, many co-occurring with highly endangered languages. Engaging speakers of indigenous languages often can help maintain nature, while efforts to conserve Natural WHSs can help preserve settings that enabled indigenous languages and cultures to emerge and persist.'

Abstract: 'Himalaya is one of the four biodiversity hotspots in India with high level of endemism. The Himalayan arc, commonly referred to as \xe2\x80\x98Water Tower\xe2\x80\x99, spreads from east of Afghanistan (Hindu Kush Region) to west of Myanmar through Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet and China and is broadly divided into Hindu Kush, Western, Central and Eastern regions representing nine of ten world\xe2\x80\x99s highest and youngest mountains. The sudden rise in height and its terrain complexity make Himalaya environmentally, climatically, ecologically, physically, physiographically as well as biologically unique fostering myriads of life forms, niches and habitats with host of microclimatic conditions across 2500 km and up to 400 km in length and breadth, respectively. The Himalaya supports a great variety of forest ecosystems and other life forms, which vary ecologically, phytosociologically, architecturally, physiognomically, functionally, etc. from east to west and from low to high elevations. For millions of years, these forests have traditionally played a vital role in conserving the environment and have provided the much-needed long-term ecological security to the Indian subcontinent. The forest ecosystems are highly significant to protect wildlife, soil development, erosion and conservation to sustain the livelihood of mankind, to stabilize climate, to optimize water yield and to purify water (Singh and Singh 1992). Northwestern Himalaya (NW Himalaya) is the western part of the Himalayan arc. It is the farthest from sea and latitudinally much higher than the rest of the Himalaya spreading NW to SE directions and has very diverse phytoclimatic patterns quite dissimilar to the areas lying eastwards. Being a part of the youngest mountain ranges of the world, these are very fragile ecosystems due to physiographic, edaphic and climatic conditions. Shivalik ranges, frontal Himalaya, the youngest hill range in the world, are one of the biodiversity micro-endemic centres in India. Present communication also includes frontal Himalaya (Shivalik ranges) and Trans-Himalayan regions, ecosystems, biodiversity and their conservation issues.'

Author: 'Drew\xc2\xa0Thomases'

Abstract: 'Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the pilgrimage and tourist town of Pushkar, India, this article looks at the environmental degradation that has befallen the holy lake there and explores efforts on the part of locals to clean it. While local Hindus believe unequivocally that their town is a heavenly place, many nevertheless recognize the need to actualize that belief. The article contends that the broad goal of making Pushkar paradise, and more specifically, the task of cleaning the lake, involves a robust process of ritualization. Thinking alongside the work of Catherine Bell, the article aims to show how environmentalism becomes ritualized, and in turn renders a place sacred. The article concludes with the idea that cleaning the lake is both an activity born out of the understanding that Pushkar is paradise and one that simultaneously sets paradise in the making.'

Abstract: 'In the light of climate change, the ecosystem services of traditionally maintained shaded Arabica coffee farms become prominent largely for increasing carbon removal. The most important function of the shade-grown coffee agroforestry system is the reduction of the concentration of Carbon in the atmosphere. It is estimated that one-hectare shade-grown coffee farm with large forest trees can sequester 70\xe2\x80\x9380 tonnes of carbon per hectare, which is more or less equivalent to the carbon stored in an equal area of forest. A full sun\xe2\x80\x93grown or open coffee in one hectare can only store less than 10 tonnes of carbon. \xe2\x80\x9cMonsooned Malabar Arabica Coffee is a specialty coffee of India, sourced from shade coffee plantation and has geographical indication (GI) protection. Shade grown coffee also serves as a refuge for biodiversity and its diverse and complex structure has a high potential to retain biodiversity in the changing climate scenarios. In this context, this paper discusses the nexus of coffee, climate and biodiversity and its implications with Wayanad, Kerala, India as a case study. This paper emphasizes the need for promoting sustainable production and consumption of coffee as a carbon neutral brand and promotion of shade grown, biodiversity rich and climate resilient coffee can emerge as a highly valued commodity in the world coffee market. Attempts at revival of the shade grown coffee system amongst the small growers with appropriate steps in marketing the coffee as a specialty product (carbon neutral and grown in bio-diverse environment) are discussed.'

Abstract: 'A cascade of reviews and growing body of literature exists on forest invasion ecology, its mechanism or causes; however, no review addressed the sustainable management of invasive plants of forest in totality. Henceforth, the present paper aims to provide a critical review on the management of invasive species particularly in the context of forest plants. Plant invasion in forest is now increasingly being recognized as a global problem, and various continents are adversely affected, although to a differential scale. Quest for the ecological mechanism lying behind the success of invasive species over native species of forest has drawn the attention of researches worldwide particularly in the context of diversity\xe2\x80\x93stability relationship. Transport, colonization, establishment, and landscape spread may be different steps in success of invasive plants in forest, and each and every step is checked through several ecological attributes. Further, several ecological attribute and hypothesis (enemy release, novel weapon, empty niche, evolution of increased competitive ability, etc.) were proposed pertaining to success of invasive plant species in forest ecosystems. However, a single theory will not be able to account for invasion success among all environments as it may vary spatially and temporally. Therefore, in order to formulate a sustainable management plan for invasive plants of forest, it is necessary to develop a synoptic view of the dynamic processes involved in the invasion process. Moreover, invasive species of forest can act synergistically with other elements of global change, including land-use change, climate change, increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nitrogen deposition. Henceforth, a unified framework for biological invasions that reconciles and integrates the key features of the most commonly used invasion frameworks into a single conceptual model that can be applied to all human-mediated invasions.'

Title: 'Agroforestry suitability mapping of India: geospatial approach based on FAO guidelines'
Author: 'Firoz\xc2\xa0Ahmad'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-018-0233-7
Abstract: 'Agroforestry system has the enormous capacity to achieve social, economic, and environmental goals by optimizing land productivity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the land potentiality in India for agroforestry based on FAO land suitability criteria utilizing various land, soil, climate, and topographic themes. This was achieved in GIS Domain by integrating various thematic layers scientifically. The analysis of land potentiality in India for agroforestry suitability reveals 32.8% as highly suitable (S1), 40.4% moderately suitable (S2), 11.7% marginally suitable (S3), and 9.1% not suitable (NS). About 52% of land of India is under the cropland category. In addition, it revealed that the 46% of these cropland areas fall into high agroforestry suitable category \xe2\x80\x9cS1,\xe2\x80\x9d and provide huge opportunity for harnessing agroforestry practices. Furthermore, agroforestry suitability mapping in broad ecosystem and in different agroecological regions will assist various projects in India at the regional level. Such results will also boost the various objectives of the National Agroforestry Policy (2014, http://www.cafri.res.in/NAF_Policy.pdf) and policymakers of India where they need to extend it. The potential of geospatial technology can be exploited in the field of agroforestry for the benefit of rural poor people/farmers by ensuring food and ecological security, resilience in livelihoods, and can sustain extreme weather events such as droughts and climate change impact. Such type of research can be replicated in India at village level (local level) to state level (regional level) utilizing the significant themes which affect the agroforestry suitability. This will certainly fetch better results on ground and will significantly assist the management programs.'

Title: 'Vegetation ecology and carbon sequestration potential of shrubs in tropics of Chhattisgarh, India'
Author: 'Manoj\xc2\xa0Kumar\xc2\xa0Jhariya'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests are well known to have great species diversity and contribute substantial share in terrestrial carbon (C) stocks worldwide. Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals ha\xe2\x88\x921 and 2.79 to 4.92\xc2\xa0m2\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to 6.76\xc2\xa0t ha\xe2\x88\x921, respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was 1.59\xe2\x80\x933.53\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 while the C sequestration potential of 0.71\xe2\x80\x931.57\xc2\xa0t\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.'

Title: 'Spatial variations in water quality of river Ganga with respect to land uses in Varanasi'
Author: 'Shikha\xc2\xa0Sharma'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-016-7411-9
Abstract: 'Water quality of a river is a function of surrounding environment and land use due to its connectivity with land, resulting in pollutants finding their way through land. This necessitates a spatially explicit study of river ecology. The paper presents a pioneer study to establish and explore the linkage between land use and water quality of river Ganga in Varanasi district. The land use land cover (LULC) map of 20\xc2\xa0km of river stretch for buffer radii of 1000\xc2\xa0m in Varanasi revealed that riparian vegetation is negligible in the district. The hierarchical cluster analysis of LULC data suggested that there are two major land use categories, viz., urban and agriculture. The land use wise principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that urbanized areas are major contributor of metals, whereas agricultural land contributes organic matter into the river. The Spearman correlation study revealed that with rising urbanization, the pollutant load into the river increased compared to that from agricultural land use. The statistical analysis of the data clearly concluded that water quality of river Ganga at Varanasi was a function of adjacent land use. The study provides an insight anticipating the Indian government to embrace the relationship of land use to river water quality while formulating policies for the upcoming River Regulation Zone.'

Abstract: 'Wildlife reserves are becoming increasingly isolated from the surrounding human-dominated landscapes particularly in Asia. It is imperative to understand how species are distributed spatially and temporally in and outside reserves, and what factors influence their occurrence. This study surveyed 7500\xc2\xa0km2 landscape surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats to examine patterns of occurrence of five herbivores: elephant, gaur, sambar, chital, and pig. Species distributions are modeled spatio-temporally using an occupancy approach. Trained field teams conducted 3860 interview-based occupancy surveys in a 10-km buffer surrounding these five reserves in 2012. I found gaur and wild pig to be the least and most wide-ranging species, respectively. Elephant and chital exhibit seasonal differences in spatial distribution unlike the other three species. As predicted, distance to reserve, the reserve itself, and forest cover were associated with higher occupancy of all species, and higher densities of people negatively influenced occurrence of all species. Park management, species protection, and conflict mitigation efforts in this landscape need to incorporate temporal and spatial understanding of species distributions. All species are known crop raiders and conflict prone locations with resources (such as water and forage) have to be monitored and managed carefully. Wildlife reserves and adjacent areas are critical for long-term persistence and habitat use for all five herbivores and must be monitored to ensure wildlife can move freely. Such a large-scale approach to map and monitor species distributions can be adapted to other landscapes to identify and monitor critical habitats shared by people and wildlife.'

Abstract: 'India exhibits a variety of land scopes and climatic conditions those are reflected in the evolution of different soils and vegetation. These also exists a significant relationship among the soils, land form climate and vegetation. Regions are delineated such that each one is as uniform as possible with respect to physiographic, climate, length of growing period (LGP) and soils for macro level and land use planning and effective transfer of agro-technology. Various Agro Climatic Zones of India according to the planning commission of India have been explained along with the classification by Indian Council of Agricultural Research. A section on Agro-ecological Zones of India has been included. The chapter also introduces the Agro-Climatic zones of Jammu and Kashmir and the Micro Agro-Climatic zones of the state. The State of Jammu and Kashmir is located almost in the middle of three climatic regimes of Asia. The chapter introduces the Agro-Climatic zones of Jammu and Kashmir based on physiography. Each province of the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been further delineated into micro agro-climatic zones which have been discussed.'

They offer a spectacular and awe-inspiring window into a world, a symphony, that humanity is but a small part of, even though we are part of it nonetheless, perhaps even an integral part. We humans definitely did not construct or design this world, and this show of nature and natural events will continue well beyond our lifetimes. But for how much longer?'

Abstract: 'Environmental Education (EE) has grown so vast, embracing so many concepts, ideas and practices, since its emergence during the UN conference on \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Environment\xe2\x80\x9d in Stockholm (1972), that it is difficult to define its boundaries. \xe2\x80\x9cEnvironmental issues will remain a serious concern in India\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cFor the future growth to be rapid and sustainable, it needs to be as resource-efficient and environmentally benign as possible\xe2\x80\x9d states India\xe2\x80\x99s Vision 2020 (http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/pl_vsn2020.pdf. Accessed on April 2, 2013). In order to meet this vision, environmental education continues to be one of the imperative strategies, aiming at improving environmental quality, thereby the quality of life of humans and other life forms across India. However, environmental education alone is inadequate in the present context since development planning today addresses the issues associated with a sustainable future. Hence, the challenge before the country is to shift from environmental education (EE) to education for sustainable development (ESD) integrating the principles of sustainable development, embracing values and wisdom and not just information. While EE took almost 30 years in India since its emergence in 1970s to carve a niche in the mainstream education and programmes, the concept of ESD has to move faster to improve the present development planning process. This chapter provides an overview of EE in India, tracing its evolution and capturing some of the important thinking, practices as well as challenges.'

Abstract: '\xe2\x80\x98Reanimating the landscape\xe2\x80\x99 recounts inspiring community-based projects across the developing world where restoration of degraded landscapes has regenerated ecosystems and human livelihoods in positively reinforcing cycles. Parallels are drawn with emerging developed world approaches to restoration of catchment functioning for pollution control, water resource protection, and flood management in increasingly nature-based ways. Examples from across the world illuminate how ecosystem restoration is protecting and increasing human security, economic benefits and opportunity, highlighting the importance of investment in the natural infrastructure essential for securing human wellbeing. However, significant difficulties are inherent in navigating a transition to a broader, systemic paradigm of greater net societal benefit and security, threatening as it may appear to established reductive norms and their associated vested interests.'

Abstract: 'The city of Bengaluru has outgrown in terms of the proportion of population and geography with profound impacts on both the physical and natural resource use. A combination of factors such as urbanisation, migration, urban poverty, complex institutions and so on have a tremendous impact on how the city is coping up with varied urban-related and environmental challenges. Urban environmental quality is one of the significant factors associated with the ability of the city to promote environmental governance. Therefore, this chapter presents an analysis of the trends and status of environmental resource use across different sectors such as water supply, sanitation, solid waste, urban ecology, etc., in the Bengaluru Metropolitan Area (BMA). The analysis is based on the methodology developed to assess the current environmental status of the city. The purpose is to illustrate an overview of better or worse conditions across different urban sectors that affect environment and ecology of the city.'

Abstract: 'The studies on forest cover change can reveal the status of forests and facilitate for its conservation planning. Idukki is the largest district in the state of Kerala having a total geographical area of 5019\xc2\xa0km2. The objectives of the present study are to map forest cover in Idukki district using multi-temporal remote sensing data (1975, 1990, 2001 and 2012) and topographical maps (1925), to analyze the trends in deforestation and land use changes. Overall statistics for the period of 1925 indicate that about 4675.7\xc2\xa0km2 (93.2\xc2\xa0%) of the landscape was under forest. The forest cover in 2012 was estimated as 2613.4\xc2\xa0km2 (52.1\xc2\xa0%). Recently, due to the implementation of policies and protection efforts, the rate of deforestation was greatly reduced.

Abstract: 'The planet earth is inhabited by diverse array of living organisms such as microorganisms, plants, animals and human beings which collectively constitute the biodiversity. Each and every element of the living component of the system has its own role, either positive or negative, to play as a system component. So preservation and conservation of living organisms, whether they are tiny or large, become immense important in playing beneficial role in maintaining biodiversity. Mega-herbivorous animal such as elephant has major impact on the terrestrial ecosystems in which they live and thus on the animals that depend on these habitats. Elephant can be referred as \xe2\x80\x9ckeystone species\xe2\x80\x9d because it facilitates feeding by other herbivores that disperse seeds and supports large assemblages of invertebrates, such as dung beetles, and lower plants such as algae and fungi apart from enriching soil nutrients through dung piles. These algae and fungi are preferred nutrient plants for some reptiles such as monitor lizard and star tortoise in the semiarid tropical forests. Dung beetle accumulation attracts many insectivorous birds. Dung deposition into water holes is being benefited to the Pisces and amphibians. Seed dispersal through alimentary canal induces germination and survival capacity of the seedlings to maintain the forest heterogeneity. Elephant also does some of the silvicultural practices such as creation of paths in dense forest, maintenance of grazing lawns and height of the trees and thinning in thick vegetation cover to keep the sustainable utility of the forest. Identification of subsoil water and natural salt licks through elephants\xe2\x80\x99 strong sense is also shared by the other animals especially the herbivores for which intake of minerals from the natural soil is most important for many physiological activities. The pachyderm is under severe threat due to various conservation problems such as loss of habitat, habitat quality and corridors, reduction of home range, population increase, impact of developmental activities, human-elephant conflict issues and poaching for ivory. Among the factors, some of them may be responsible for major proportions, and some of them involve less proportion. But these are the reasons listed as conservation problems for the long-run conservation of Asian elephant especially in Southern India.'

Title: 'Connecting the dots: mapping habitat connectivity for tigers in central India'
Author: 'Trishna\xc2\xa0Dutta'

Abstract: 'Large connected landscapes are paramount to maintain top predator populations. Across their range, tiger (Panthera tigris) populations occur in small fragmented patches of habitat, often isolated by large distances in human-dominated landscapes. We assessed connectivity between 16 protected areas (PAs) in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, using data on land use and land cover, human population density, and transportation infrastructure. We identified and prioritized movement routes using a combination of least-cost corridor modeling and circuit theory. Our analyses suggest that there are several opportunities to maintain connectivity in this landscape. We mapped a total of thirty-five linkages in the region and calculated metrics to estimate their quality and importance. The highest quality linkages as measured by the ratio of cost-weighted distance to Euclidean distance are Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen/Bandhavgarh\xe2\x80\x93SanjayGhasidas/Melghat\xe2\x80\x93Satpura, and cost-weighted distance to least-cost path length are Nawegaon\xe2\x80\x93Tadoba/Achanakmar\xe2\x80\x93SanjayGhasidas/Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen. We used current flow centrality to evaluate the contribution of each PA and linkage toward facilitating animal movement. Values are highest for Kanha and Pench tiger reserves, and the linkages between Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Phen, Kanha\xe2\x80\x93Pench, and Pench\xe2\x80\x93Satpura, suggesting that these PAs and linkages play a critical role in maintaining connectivity in central India. In addition, smaller areas such as Bor, Nawegaon, and Phen have high centrality scores relative to their areas and thus may act as important stepping stones. We mapped pinch points, which are sections of the linkages where tiger movement is restricted due to unfavorable habitat, transportation networks, human habitation, or a combination of factors. Currently, very limited data exist on tiger movement outside of PAs to validate model results. Regional-scale connectivity mapping efforts can assist managers and policy makers to develop strategic plans for balancing wildlife conservation and other land uses in the landscape.'

Abstract: 'While modern notion of progress was destructive to nature, the rich biodiversity materials and knowledge have been preserved by people practicing traditional lifestyle. Today, efforts are being made to preserve, promote, and ethically share their knowledge. In this chapter, we describe four different cases to bring out varieties of challenges these efforts meet. The first is a celebrated case of scientists approaching with due respect the Kani scheduled tribe community to learn and share their indigenous knowledge. The second is an organized effort to preserve, maintain, and promote application of traditional medicinal knowledge, innovations, and practices of local communities. The third case is that of protection, production, and marketing of basmati rice after the infamous dispute between India and USA in the 1990s was settled. The fourth is a case of application and marketing of traditional knowledge of biodiversity processing in the form of cosmetics and perfumes. The case studies in this chapter bring out the merits and limits of the legal and institutional structures adopted by India.'

Title: 'Analysing India\xe2\x80\x99s current national forest inventory for biodiversity information'
Author: 'Arun\xc2\xa0Kumar\xc2\xa0Thakur'

Abstract: 'This study attempts to review the various biodiversity related parameters envisaged in the current national forest inventory (NFI) of India in comparison to those used worldwide as indicators of forest biodiversity. The study reveals that a good amount of biodiversity related parameters are available, covering the structural attribute of biodiversity, tree species composition, and other important functional attributes like deadwood and litter. In spite of this timber-based approach, a number of variables are available to talk on biodiversity aspects of Indian forests. However, the comparison with the parameters found in literature shows that the scope of further improvement does exist in current NFI\xe2\x80\x99s ability to contribute towards a documentation and management of biodiversity. Our gap analysis indicates that enhancing the capacity of the current NFI to generate overall biodiversity information urgently required for safeguarding and conserving the natural wealth of India is strongly needed.'

Author: 'Madhu\xc2\xa0Verma'
URL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-53967-6_6
Abstract: 'Forest ecosystems provide many essential and life-sustaining services. In South Asia, the contribution of forests in supporting dependent rural populations is even more prominent. However, their contribution to the economy is severely underestimated. This is largely due to the fact that comprehensive information on forest ecosystems and its linkage to human well-being is often unavailable which restricts decision-makers in adequately recognizing their significance and consequently their actions for management of these ecosystems. This chapter seeks to address this issue by highlighting the important role of economic valuation on designing appropriate policies for balancing conservation and development in South Asia. Emphasizing the need to develop appropriate incentive-based mechanisms for promoting conservation, the chapter demonstrates how investing in forest capital can have a multiplier effect in the economy. The chapter also focus on mountain areas, a large part of them covered with forests, and their role in provision of water to downstream regions which are predominantly involved in agriculture.'

Author: 'S.\xc2\xa0Viswanath'
URL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-7650-3_3
Abstract: 'Traditional agroforestry systems (TAFS) may be described as a set of age-old agroforestry systems which are generally devoid of intentional intensified cultivation of agricultural or forage crops and which have been practiced across the world with varying structure, function, socio-economic attributes and ecological services. TAFS are distributed worldwide though predominantly in the tropics across Asia, Africa, South America and Pacific islands. They have been reported in temperate regions across Europe and North America too in a much more contrasting spatial and temporal pattern as compared to tropics. Among TAFS, homegardens and variants of multi-storeyed cropping systems seem to dominate in the Asian, African and Latin America. There are plenty of similarities in phytosociology, structure and diversity of homegardens whether it is in Kerala, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Indonesia, Tanzania, Amazonian belt in Peru and Brazil, Honduras or in Pacific islands. In the Indian context, scattered trees on croplands like silvopasture system focusing on some particular species like Acacia leucophloea, Acacia nilotica, Prosopis cineraria and Ficus spp. appear to have been reported prominently and characterized by its specificity. Indeed, stark similarities in structure and function with the parkland systems of West African region dominated by Faidherbia (Acacia) albida and with the Quercus suber-dominated Dehesa system of Mediterranean Europe and the fruit tree-dominated landscapes in other parts of Europe like England, France and Germany are noticeable. Invariably in almost all TAFS, native trees appear to predominate and have a major structural, functional and service role to play whether it is in the tropics, subtopics or temperate regions across the globe. Some of the prominent traditional agroforestry systems and practices reported in scientific literature are compiled in this chapter.'

Abstract: 'The focal point of this chapter is a critique of colonialism and its economic exploitation of forest resources, which had devastating consequences on the environment and tribal population of south India during the pre-Forest Act period (1792\xe2\x80\x931882). Saravanan argues that the thrust of colonial forest policy was the maximum extraction of forest resources for commercial purposes, rather than for conservation. Besides encouraging the commercialisation of forest resources and non-tribal settlements, this policy led to the disintegration of the traditional tribal system as well as the forest-oriented economy.'

Abstract: 'Since historical times, natural ecosystems such as forests and wetlands are known to regulate water flow and maintain water quality. The past half a century however has witnessed unplanned and rapid development with widespread ecosystem degradation. Meanwhile water treatment and supply happens on an ad hoc basis that is neither sustainable nor affordable for most communities. The revival of an ecohydrological approach is called for, with increased use of ecosystem services in water resources management. The affordable and sustainable aspects of this approach make it especially pertinent for developing countries, given the increasing challenges posed by mounting population, consumption, and climate change. This chapter describes the general links between different ecosystems, hydrology, and water quality and outlines the steps in developing an ecohydrological approach. The next chapter describes case studies that have successfully incorporated an ecohydrological approach in different realms of water resources management in the developing world.'

Abstract: 'The concept of wildlife species conservation starts with the identification of their suitable habitat as it provides essential information for wildlife refuge design and management. In this study, multiple logistic regression is integrated with remote sensing and geographic information system to evaluate the suitable habitats available for sambar (Rusa unicolor) in Chandoli Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra, India (17\xc2\xb0 04\xe2\x80\xb2 00\xe2\x80\xb3N to 17\xc2\xb0 19\xe2\x80\xb2 54\xe2\x80\xb3N and 73\xc2\xb0 40\xe2\x80\xb2 43\xe2\x80\xb3E to 73\xc2\xb0 53\xe2\x80\xb2 09\xe2\x80\xb3E). Satellite imageries of LISS-III of IRS-P6 of study area were digitally processed. To generate collateral data topographic maps were analysed in a GIS framework. Layers of different variables such as land use land cover, forest density, proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created from satellite imageries and topographic maps. These layers along with GPS location of sambar presence/absence and multiple logistic regression (MLR) techniques were integrated in a GIS environment to model habitat suitability index of sambar. The results indicate that approximately 69.92\xc2\xa0km2 (24\xc2\xa0%) of the forest of tiger reserve was least suitable for sambar, whereas 82.60\xc2\xa0km2 (28\xc2\xa0%) was moderately suitable, 88.25\xc2\xa0km2 (30\xc2\xa0%) suitable and 54.01\xc2\xa0km2 (18\xc2\xa0%) was highly suitable. The accuracy level of this model was 80.2\xc2\xa0%. The model advocates that forests of this area are most appropriate for declaring it as a reserve for sambar conservation.'

Abstract: 'Numerous ideas have emerged on the definitions, consequences of introduction, causes of damage, population dynamics and mode of propagation, prevention, and adaptibility of invasive species along with their impact on native species directly or indirectly by way of alteration of ecosystem dynamics. An Invasive species is defined as a species having been introduced outside its native range through human activities which are likely to cause economic or ecological harm. Estuaries and Coastal-Estuarine \xe2\x80\x93Mangrove ecosystems being the most productive and sensitive ecosystems in the world, have appeared to be very much susceptible to introductions of non-native species because of lot of possibilities out of different ecological and people oriented activities in and around these eco-regions such as shipping and boating, ecotourism, fisheries, aquaculture etc. Alongside, several ecological perturbations such as eutrophication, global warming, biomagnification and biotransformation of persistent pollutants, etc. along with the negative impacts of introduced species on marine estuarine flora and fauna by outcompeting them for basic life support resources, human health risk associated with transmission of pathogens, and higher bioaccumulation capabilities of invasive species than native species have threatened this ecologically sensitive region considerably.'

Title: 'Assessing Potential Conservation and Restoration Areas of Freshwater\xc2\xa0Fish Fauna in the Indian River Basins'
Author: 'Jay\xc2\xa0P.\xc2\xa0Bhatt'

Abstract: 'Conservation efforts globally are skewed toward terrestrial ecosystems. To date, conservation of aquatic ecosystems, in particular fish fauna, is largely neglected. We provide a country-wide assessment of Indian river ecosystems in order to identify and prioritize areas for protection and restoration of freshwater fish fauna. Using various biodiversity and anthropogenic attributes, coupled with tools of ecological modeling, we delineated areas for fish fauna conservation and restoration in the 20 major river basins of India. To do this, we used prioritization analyses and reserve selection algorithms to derive conservation value index (CVI) and vulnerability index (VI) of the river basins. CVI was estimated using endemicity, rarity, conservation value, and taxonomic singularity, while VI was estimated using a disturbance index derived from percent geographic area of the basin under human settlements, human population density, predominant land use, and total number of exotic fish species in each basin. The two indices, CVI and VI, were converted into geo-referenced maps, and each map was super-imposed onto species richness and forest cover maps, respectively. After superimposition, areas with high CVI and low VI shade intensities were delineated for conservation, while areas with high CVI and high VI shade intensities were demarcated for restoration. In view of the importance of freshwater fish for human livelihoods and consumption, and ecosystems of India\xe2\x80\x99s rivers, we call for urgent attention to the conservation of their fish fauna along with restoration of their degraded habitats.'

Abstract: 'A systematic review has been carried out for preparing the checklist of mammalian species of the Indian Himalayan region (IHR), based on field surveys, available published literature, and IUCN database. A total of 282 species representing 36 families and 11 orders that were reported in the IHR. The diversity of mammalian species is high (66.5%) in Himalayan region followed by Indo-Burma region (44.8%). The information on many species is not available for majority of the PAs in the IHR. Hence, it is recommended that efforts should be made toward assessing the conservation status of species which are under unfavorable condition and with endangered conservation status.'

Abstract: 'The Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) Partnership, developed and managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG Kew), conserves propagules primarily from orthodox seed-bearing wild vascular plants. It is the largest ex situ conservation programme in the world, currently involving 96 countries and territories. Where possible, seeds are collected and conserved in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to RBG Kew\xe2\x80\x99s MSB for storage. In this paper we assess the conservation value of the germplasm stored at the MSB using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The MSB holdings represent a high quality, rich biological resource. Substantial and unique taxonomic diversity exists amongst the collections, representing 365 families, 5813 genera, 36,975 species and 39,669 taxa conserved. The collections cover a wide geographic range, originating from 189 countries and territories, representing all nine bio-geographic regions and all 35 biodiversity hotspots. The collections possess significant natural capital and population value: 32% of taxa, representing 49% of collections, have at least one identified use to humans; and 74% of taxa, representing 78% of collections, are either endemic, endangered (nationally or globally) and/or have an economic, ecological, social, cultural or scientific value. While 10% of taxa, representing >\xc2\xa08% of collections, are either extinct, rare or vulnerable to extinction at the global and/or national level, 20% of taxa, representing 13% collections, are endemic at the country or territory scale. Over the 17-year period since 2000 at least 11,182 seed samples, representing 12% of taxa and 8% of collections, have been distributed globally for conservation, research, education and display. This analysis highlighted collection gaps in MSB holdings in relation to their geographic representativeness, the taxonomic diversity of large families and genera of angiosperms, and coverage of threatened taxa. Further analysis across the entire MSB Partnership is required to underpin future collection activities and maximize the usefulness of collections.'

Author: 'Ashok\xc2\xa0Kumar'
URL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-55741-8_15
Abstract: 'Coastal environment contains diverse resources and productive habitats for human settlements. Local subsistence coastal zones have been among the most heavily utilized area because of their resources. The North Kanara coast has total geographic area of 10,291\xc2\xa0km2. About 0.2 million hectares of land in the study area is under agriculture and horticulture. The present study is based on 5 taluks out of total 11 taluks for better analysis. The database used for the study is mainly secondary. An extensive literature survey has also been done covering with various dimensions of resources of the coastal zone. The secondary data collected from several institutions has given a base for the research work. In North Kanara role of local people in the management is not significant, as most of the local people don\xe2\x80\x99t think that they are participating adequately in the management processes. The criticalities of the problems are not similar throughout the coast. Karwar has maximum length of coastline followed by Honavar, Kumta, Bhatkal and Ankola. The area under different coastal regulation zone in different talukas varies as well. The uneven spatial development along the coastal development has resulted variation in the potentiality and challenges for development. The integrated coastal zone management is needed for the coastal zone of North Kanara. The priority areas, which should be taken under consideration for the coastal zone management of North Kanara, are pollution control as the high pollution level is leading to emergence of a number of other problems and ultimately damaging the environmental health of coastal zone.'

Title: 'Conservation of Plant Diversity in Rural Homegardens with Cultural and Geographical Variation in Three Districts of Barak Valley, Northeast India1 '
Author: 'Tapasi\xc2\xa0Das'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12231-015-9299-6
Abstract: 'Homegardens are recognized worldwide as sustainable agroforestry systems that are repositories of species and genetic diversity. Species diversity and composition of homegardens are influenced by a number of environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. The present study examines the tree species diversity in the homegardens of different cultural groups of Barak Valley, Assam, Northeast India. Complete enumeration was done for diversity analysis in 181 homegardens from 38 villages in the three districts of the Valley. Factors affecting plant diversity were analyzed, and the floristic composition of the homegardens was found to vary with garden size, ethnicity of the homegarden owners, and geographical parameters such as location and altitude. Results indicate high plant diversity, with a total of 161 tree species identified from 47 families. Tea garden labor communities were comparatively found to hold more diversity in their homegardens. Similarity and cluster analysis revealed the distinctness of the majority of the homegardens, and seven groups of homegardens with very low distance were revealed. Homegardens were also found to maintain considerable conservation value as repositories of many underutilized, wild, and rare plant species. Biodiversity conservation in the homegardens was found to be linked to the multiple values of the different plant species to the homegardeners and further highlight the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cconservation through use\xe2\x80\x9d approach. For the preservation of such traditional agroforestry systems, which also have the potential to provide options for adaptation to climate change, proper documentation of traditional knowledge concerning the different plant species and the human-nature interaction in the homegardens is necessary before such systems are completely lost.'

Author: 'Ramachandra\xc2\xa0T V'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40663-016-0069-4
Abstract: 'Landscapes consist of heterogeneous interacting dynamic elements with complex ecological, economic and cultural attributes. These complex interactions help in the sustenance of natural resources through bio-geochemical and hydrological cycling. The ecosystem functions are altered with changes in the landscape structure. Fragmentation of large contiguous forests to small and isolated forest patches either by natural phenomena or anthropogenic activities leads to drastic changes in forest patch sizes, shape, connectivity and internal heterogeneity, which restrict the movement leading to inbreeding among Meta populations with extirpation of species.'

Title: 'Vulnerability of Forests in India: A National Scale Assessment'
Author: 'Jagmohan\xc2\xa0Sharma'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-017-0894-4
Abstract: 'Forests are subjected to stress from climatic and non-climatic sources. In this study, we have reported the results of inherent, as well as climate change driven vulnerability assessments for Indian forests. To assess inherent vulnerability of forests under current climate, we have used four indicators, namely biological richness, disturbance index, canopy cover, and slope. The assessment is presented as spatial profile of inherent vulnerability in low, medium, high and very high vulnerability classes. Fourty percent forest grid points in India show high or very high inherent vulnerability. Plantation forests show higher inherent vulnerability than natural forests. We assess the climate change driven vulnerability by combining the results of inherent vulnerability assessment with the climate change impact projections simulated by the Integrated Biosphere Simulator dynamic global vegetation model. While 46% forest grid points show high, very high, or extremely high vulnerability under future climate in the short term (2030s) under both representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5, such grid points are 49 and 54%, respectively, in the long term (2080s). Generally, forests in the higher rainfall zones show lower vulnerability as compared to drier forests under future climate. Minimizing anthropogenic disturbance and conserving biodiversity can potentially reduce forest vulnerability under climate change. For disturbed forests and plantations, adaptive management aimed at forest restoration is necessary to build long-term resilience.'

Abstract: 'India\xe2\x80\x99s Gujarat state has a long coastline with rich maritime history. The entrepreneurial nature of its citizens enabled Gujarat to emerge as the most aggressive industrial development state in the country. Due to the availability of vast land resource for industrial expansion along the coast, affordable labor cost, sparse human density and liberal state government policies have significantly contributed towards the outburst of the industrial sector\xe2\x80\x99s growth across Gujarat. Ecologically fragile ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, mudflats, salt marshes, sea grass beds and nesting sites of winter migratory birds are increasingly threatened due to direct and indirect pressure induced by the industrial and allied development projects. This article reviews the status of coastal environment in Gujarat state with an emphasis on integrated coastal management associated laws and regulations.'

Title: 'Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) in Northeast India: An Overview of Availability, Utilization, and Conservation'
Author: 'Shovan\xc2\xa0Dattagupta'
URL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-0620-3_19
Abstract: 'Northeast India spreads over an area of 255,088\xc2\xa0km2 comprising 7.7\xe2\x80\x89% of the total geographical area of India. Being located in the confluence of Indo-Malayan, Indo-Chinese, and Indian biogeographic subregions, the region has rich floral and faunal diversity, which is paralleled by high ethnic diversity of over 200 distinct ethnic groups. A large number of communities in this region are traditionally dependent on forest products, especially non-timber forest products (NTFPs), which play a significant role in the maintenance of subsistence and provision of food security to these communities. The study reveals that as much as 94\xe2\x80\x89% of the population is dependent on the forest for subsistence in some parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, 60\xe2\x80\x9390\xe2\x80\x89% of the tribal population in states like Nagaland, Manipur, and Tripura is dependent for various purposes on forest resources. Even in the other parts of Northeast India, the level of dependence on forest products is considerable. This paper, therefore, provides an overview of the availability, utilization, and conservation of NTFPs in Northeast India.'

Author: 'Sumit\xc2\xa0Chakravarty'
URL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-2262-0_13
Abstract: 'NTFPs are primary or supplemental source of livelihood mainly in the poor and developing nations. NTFPs contribute significantly to forest economy of developed and industrialized nations also. NTFPs can be processed or value added into consumer-oriented products. They have commercial importance and can contribute to the economic development of a region or a nation. Commercialization or value addition of NTFPs is now promoted as an approach to rural development especially in tropical forest areas. Unfortunately, commercialization of NTFPs has exploited and deprived the collectors. The chapter describes the prospects, constraints, and strategies to overcome these constraints of NTFP development and its value addition. The successful NTFP commercialization will be transparent, equitable, and sustainable which will have a positive impact on poverty reduction, gender equality, resource access, tenure, and management which demands aggressive policy interventions. The effective policy interventions can improve the stake of all stakeholders involved in NTFP from collection to value addition and ultimately improve collection, value addition, income, and livelihood without sacrificing the principles of sustainable forest conservation.'

Author: 'Subhajyoti\xc2\xa0Das'

Abstract: 'The arid and semiarid areas of the country, a major part of which suffers from recurrent drought, are under increasing economic and environmental strain mainly because of water scarcity. Due to paucity of surface water, groundwater has emerged as the sole sustainable source for water supply and irrigation in this terrain. But its widely variable occurrence and potential in time and space necessitate its delineation, development, conservation, and protection from overexploitation and pollution. Studies and experiences have shown that integrated water resource management involving conjunctive use and rainwater harvesting as part of watershed development can ensure water security and equity. Science and technology has a big role in water resource management which holds key to the economic growth of the region. This article narrates and analyzes some recent efforts in augmenting and conserving scarce water resources with community participation to achieve this objective in this terrain.'

Abstract: 'Tropical forests play a crucial role as source and sink in global carbon cycle. Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India.'

Author: 'Joachim\xc2\xa0Schmerbeck'

Abstract: 'This review is intended to contribute to the understanding of the interlinkage between wildfire in India\xe2\x80\x99s tropical dry forest (TDF) and selected ecosystem services (ES), namely forest provisioning and water regulating services, as well as biodiversity. TDF covers approximately 146,000\xc2\xa0km2 (4.4\xc2\xa0%) of India, whereas according to the MODIS fire product\xc2\xa0about 2200\xc2\xa0km2 (1.4\xc2\xa0%) burns per year. As studies on wildfire effects upon ESs and biodiversity in Indian TDFs are rare we partly transferred findings from other (dry) forest areas to the environmental situation in India. In India (intentionally lit) wildfires have a very important connection to local livelihoods and the availability of non-wood forest products. Very important adverse long-term effects are the deterioration of forest ecosystems and soil degradation. The potential for TDF to regulate hydrological cycles is expected to be greater in the absence of fire than with it. A general judgment on the effect of fire on biodiversity is difficult as it depends on the community and species involved but a loss of biodiversity under regular burnings is apparent. Consequently, forest managers need sound knowledge regarding the interplay of wildfires and ecosystem behavior in general and more specific knowledge regarding the effects on taxa being considered for conservation efforts. Generally, much more research is needed to understand the trade-offs between the short-term benefits gained from forest provisioning services and long-term adverse effects.'

Author: 'A.\xc2\xa0Krishnakumar'

Abstract: 'The geomorphic and geologic evolution of coastal lands of Southwest India is influenced by many local and regional factors, including changes in climate, sea level and local and regional tectonics in the late Quaternary period. The wetlands in Kerala State in Southwestern India, forming an interlacing network, act as an integral part of the socio-environmental frame of the state (Kerala) playing vital roles in the hydrological, biological and biogeochemical features of the environment. However, these systems were mismanaged due to lack of scientific data and proper appreciation of the ecosystem functions. During the recent years, there is a growing concern for conservation and management of the wetlands. This chapter provides some baseline data on the geochemical characteristics of the sediments and the water quality of four important wetlands in the state, namely, Vellayani Lake, Sasthamkotta Lake, Pookot Lake (lacustrine wetlands) and Ashtamudi Lake (estuarine wetland), and provides some insights into the need for their conservation.'

Abstract: 'The introductory chapter offers broad overview of the challenges and potentials of contemporary patterns and processes of urbanization in India with \xe2\x80\x98sustainability\xe2\x80\x99 as the nucleus, manifested in the recent Smart City Mission. It contextualizes the emergence and implementation of the project across long-term spatio-temporal trajectories that had not only initiated the concept of \xe2\x80\x98sustainable\xe2\x80\x99 but also interpolated it in discourses on development and urbanization. Accommodating the three major components of urban sustainability: governance of infrastructures and investments, management of wastes and wetlands and explorations of urban ecology and environmentalisms, it summarizes conceptual chapters and case studies that confer nuanced readings and explorations of micro-political processes and weaves these disparate ideas into connected and comprehensive webs of thought. Critically interrogating exclusionary aspects of \xe2\x80\x98smart\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98sustainable\xe2\x80\x99 urbanization in contemporary India, the chapter captures the dialectical tensions between cities\xe2\x80\x99 insane rush towards achieving the status of \xe2\x80\x98world class\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98global\xe2\x80\x99 and numerous local processes and \xe2\x80\x98stubborn realities\xe2\x80\x99, thus bringing to the forefront \xe2\x80\x98epistemology of the particulars\xe2\x80\x99, unpacking the embeddedness of the global and the local processes.'

Title: 'Traditional \xe2\x80\x98maavee\xe2\x80\x99 rice production in Sri Lanka: environmental, economic and social pressures revealed through stakeholder interviews'
Author: 'Finbarr\xc2\xa0G.\xc2\xa0Horgan'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10333-017-0604-0
Abstract: 'The Nilwala Ganga Basin of Sri Lanka includes important natural wetlands that are habitat for vulnerable animal and plant species. Flood protection and intensive rice production in the Basin have resulted in degraded acid soils and declining rice yields. However, traditional \xe2\x80\x98maavee\xe2\x80\x99 rice production outside the flood protection scheme has continued to generate a high-value rice product. This study reports on interviews conducted with farmers and other stakeholders to document the production practices and the potential environmental and economic benefits associated with maavee rice paddies. The maavee production system has prevailed for at least several decades. Farmers apply no chemicals to their paddies, relying instead on alluvial deposits as a source of nutrients, and on the natural pest and disease resistance of their traditional varieties. The maavee rice product can attain three times the selling price of rice from conventional farms making it more economically viable than conventional rice production. However, much of maavee production is for home consumption and the system is threatened by increasing labour costs, an ageing farming population and pressures to increase rice yields. Non-invasive production practices and the proximity of maavee paddies to regenerating wetlands in the Kirala Kele Sanctuary suggest that traditional paddies may constitute an important habitat for vulnerable wildlife; however, maavee farmers also perceive wetland birds as potentially damaging to rice. Based on a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis, we make recommendations for future research needs and potential management actions to safeguard the environmental and economic sustainability of the maavee system.'

Title: 'Trans-Himalayan Trade in an Imperial Environment'
Author: 'Christoph\xc2\xa0Bergmann'

Abstract: 'This chapter explores how the Bhotiyas dealt with imperial forms of power and authority in order to realize their trade under British colonial rule in nineteenth-century Kumaon. Based on a combined analysis of oral and written historical sources I show that British imperial sovereignty, similar to that of older regimes in the area, remained malleable and contested within the wider relational field of the Bhotiyas\xe2\x80\x99 trans-Himalayan trade. When the British East India Company annexed Kumaon in 1815 it was recognized as a so-called Non-regulation Province, which meant that government officials could flexibly interpret executive orders to suit the realities on the ground. Procedural simplicity and discretionary decisions created scope for both shaping and contesting British hegemony, leading to an adaptive transformation of imperial rule. Through a close examination of British interactions with Kumaon\xe2\x80\x99s traders, the chapter will reveal the frictions that arose from this exceptional legal status. This focus serves to address the broader question of how sovereign claims work through multiple and shifting articulations, from frontier narratives to cartographic representations and from fluid relationships of allegiance to fixed state boundaries. The analysis considers a previous call to conceive High Asia as a continuous zone and an agentive site of political action by arguing that confluent territories and overlapping sovereignties are key to understanding trans-Himalayan trade in an imperial environment.'

Title: 'Development of National Database on Long-term Deforestation in Sri Lanka'
Author: 'C.\xc2\xa0Sudhakar Reddy'

Abstract: 'Sri Lanka is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. This study has utilized satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques to generate a nation-wide database on forests, forest types and land use/land cover of Sri Lanka. Spatial assessment of forest cover changes was carried out for the periods 1976\xe2\x80\x931985, 1985\xe2\x80\x931994, 1994\xe2\x80\x932005 and 2005\xe2\x80\x932014. The landscape fragmentation analysis has carried out to calculate the spatial and temporal patterns of forest. Land use/land cover map was prepared representing seven classes in 2014. The plantations occupy a large area (34.2%) followed by forests (33.4%) and agriculture (26.1%) in 2014. During the period of 1976\xe2\x80\x932014, the forest has been decreased by 5.5%. From 1976 to 1985 forest recorded a loss at an annual rate of 0.49%. This annual rate decreased to 0.01% during 2005\xe2\x80\x932014 indicates declining trend of deforestation and effective conservation measures. The study found deforestation hotspots in south east and northern most parts of the Sri Lanka. Total number of patches estimated has increased from 15193 in 1976 to 16136 in 2014. The study has found that main causes of deforestation in Sri Lanka were due to expansion of agriculture and plantations. The extent of change detected in the study through geospatial techniques has significance to the forest ecology and management of natural landscapes in Sri Lanka.'

Title: 'Dynamics and determinants of land change in India: integrating satellite data with village socioeconomics'
Author: 'Prasanth\xc2\xa0Meiyappan'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-016-1068-2
Abstract: 'We examine the dynamics and spatial determinants of land change in India by integrating decadal land cover maps (1985\xe2\x80\x931995\xe2\x80\x932005) from a wall-to-wall analysis of Landsat images with spatiotemporal socioeconomic database for ~630,000 villages in India. We reinforce our results through collective evidence from synthesis of 102 case studies that incorporate field knowledge of the causes of land change in India. We focus on cropland\xe2\x80\x93fallow land conversions, and forest area changes (excludes non-forest tree categories including commercial plantations). We show that cropland to fallow conversions are prominently associated with lack of irrigation and capital, male agricultural labor shortage, and fragmentation of land holdings. We find gross forest loss is substantial and increased from ~23,810\xc2\xa0km2 (1985\xe2\x80\x931995) to ~25,770\xc2\xa0km2 (1995\xe2\x80\x932005). The gross forest gain also increased from ~6000\xc2\xa0km2 (1985\xe2\x80\x931995) to ~7440\xc2\xa0km2 (1995\xe2\x80\x932005). Overall, India experienced a net decline in forest by ~18,000\xc2\xa0km2 (gross loss\xe2\x80\x93gross gain) consistently during both decades. We show that the major source of forest loss was cropland expansion in areas of low cropland productivity (due to soil degradation and lack of irrigation), followed by industrial development and mining/quarrying activities, and excessive economic dependence of villages on forest resources.'

Abstract: 'India is considered land of spices. Of the 109 varieties of spices listed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the country produces more than 65 spices and which are mainly under conventional practices. Though organic farming is not anew, scientific and organized production of organic spices is blooming in snail\xe2\x80\x99space. Very negligible data are available in this domain. Among total turn-over of organic products from India to world export basket, the contribution of spices was only about 1%, till now. Indiscriminate use of synthetic fertilizers, plant protection chemicals, processing inputs etc., in vast areas of spice fields or orchards are major drawbacks for early adoption of organic conversion of these existing lands under cultivation. Provision of subsidies on organic inputs, scaling up of organic production strategies, framing up of well-connected market intelligence will boost up the situation to a greater extent in near future.'

Abstract: 'Sustainable food production is one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century in the era of global environmental problems such as climate change, increasing population and natural resource degradation including soil degradation and biodiversity loss. Climate change is among the greatest threats to agricultural systems. Green Revolution though multiplied agricultural production several folds but at the huge environmental cost including climate change. It jeopardized the ecological integrity of agroecosystems by intensive use of fossil fuels, natural resources, agrochemicals and machinery. Moreover, it threatened the age-old traditional agricultural practices. Agriculture is one of the largest sectors that sustain livelihood to maximum number of people and contribute to climate change. Therefore, a climate-smart approach to sustainable food production is the need of hour. Traditional agriculture is getting increased attention worldwide in context of sustainable food production in changing climate. The present article advocates traditional agriculture as a climate-smart approach for the sustainable food production and also deliberates the correlation between climate change and agriculture.'

Abstract: 'Invasive species, from their natives enter into new areas where they establish, proliferate, spread and affect the natural communities. They alter the local biodiversity, cause changes in hydrology and ecosystem functions. In this chapter, we review the global distribution of invasive vines, their impacts, widely-used control measures and future prospects. According to Global Invasive Species Database (2013) and other sources, a total of 55 vines are considered as world\xe2\x80\x99s worst invasive species. Approximately 29 % of the vines have drifted from Asia to North America, South America, Europe, Oceania and Africa. However, only 6 % of invasive vines have invaded from North America to Asia and Oceania. Approximately, 21 %, 19 % and 17 % of the invasive vines have spread to Europe, Asia and South America respectively. A concise account on world\xe2\x80\x99s top ten invasive climbers is provided in this chapter. A detailed review on the ecology of two prominent invasive vines in India viz. Mikania micrantha and Lantana camara are also included. Different control measures viz. physical, chemical, biological and cultural methods are in practice to contain the vigorous growth of several invasive vines. However, an integrated approach has been proven to be most successful. Though invasive vines are noxious and notorious to the environment, they also have some ecological and economic benefits as ornamentals, edibles, medicinal plants etc. Considering their impacts on environment on one side and the economic values on the other side, wiser management of these species is emphasized.'

Abstract: 'Jaipur city since its inception has flourished as an administrative, economic and cultural center. Jaipur gained the status of a Million Plus City in 1991 and was recognized as a metropolitan region in 2010. During the post-independence planning era, there have been marked deviations in the growth and development in Jaipur, be it related to the spatial spread of the urban area or the growth of population. With the spatial spread and population growth, the city and its region are not bereft of problems. Understanding of Jaipur region has highlighted that secondary and tertiary sector play a dominant. The dynamics and interdependence between the sectors has led to identification of the prime potential segment that may lead the region out of the environmental imbalance into which the region is fast plunging. The problems that have come to be associated with these very large regions need to be address with the use of technology and innovation. The answers to these may lie in the smart context which has been explored in this chapter in the context of Jaipur Region. Authors have suggested a vision based on the issues and potential of the region within current policies of central and state government. Strategies are proposed for increasing the regional economic resilience through locally-based, regionally-driven development initiatives based on technology and innovation focused on smart tourism.'

Title: 'Implications of demographic changes and land transformations on surface water quality of rural and urban subbasins of Upper Bhima River basin, Maharashtra, India'

Abstract: 'For sustainable development in a river basin, it is crucial to understand population growth\xe2\x80\x93land use/land cover (LU/LC) transformations\xe2\x80\x93water quality nexus. This study investigates the effects of demographic changes and LU/LC transformations on surface water quality of rural (Ghod) and urban (Mula-Mutha) subbasins of Upper Bhima River basin. Population data (1981\xe2\x80\x932011) and LU/LC data {October 2002 [Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data] and October/November 2009 (Indian Remote Sensing 1C Linear Imaging Self Scanner III data]} were analysed using statistical, remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to study demographic and LU/LC changes, respectively. Further, overall indices of pollution (OIPs) developed specifically for rural subbasin (OIPr: Hardness CaCO3 and Total Dissolved Solids), urban subbasin (OIPu: Biological Oxygen Demand, Chlorides, Coliform Total, Colour, Dissolved Oxygen%, pH and Turbidity) and single OIP considering all parameters (OIPa) were used for spatio-temporal water quality assessment of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Results revealed that from 1981 to 2011, population increase was higher in urban subbasin than in rural subbasin. Subsequently, from 2002 to 2009 mainly increase in built-up lands (3.82%) and agricultural lands (15.35%) in urban and rural subbasins respectively, affected their water quality. From 2002 to 2009, the highest increase in OIPr and OIPu was observed at Kashti (3.37\xe2\x80\x936.52 due to fertilizers) and Bundgarden Bridge (3.03\xe2\x80\x937.83 due to municipal and industrial wastes) stations of rural and urban subbasins, respectively. With significant increase in OIPa of 2.74\xe2\x80\x936.70, Bundgarden Bridge station affected by urbanization had the most polluted water quality.'

Abstract: 'Geobotany or Vegetation Science is the discipline that attempts to document and understand spatial and temporal patterns of diversity in the world of plants and vegetation. Diversity has evolved into a key word in ecological but also geobotanical research, and so the introductory part draws attention to some aspects of biodiversity: The present-day biodiversity of the earth is reflected from a palaeoecological viewpoint. The natural diversity of climate, geodiversity and biodiversity constitute the treasures of the present global ecosystems. So, biodiversity is a concept of different aspects: Structural biodiversity of life forms, functional biodiversity of ecosystems and production, and evolutionary diversity of long-term and short-term evolution. We share our planet Earth with countless other creatures\xe2\x80\x94today about 1.75 million species of animals, plants and microorganisms are registered, and we know that many more species exist: perhaps between 10 and 100 million species. However, a portion will go extinct before even being discovered.'

Abstract: 'Wetland ecosystems are among the most productive ecosystems that support many kinds of life. They are valuable in terms of hydrology, plant and animal survival, and biodiversity. National Wetland Directory of Sri Lanka describes 62 important wetlands, with their status. The central highland complex of Sri Lanka is a unique ecosystem and the most important catchment area of major rivers. Therefore, it is identified as a super biodiversity hotspot and a world heritage site. The major wetland types in the central highland ecosystem are freshwater marshes, streams, waterfalls, human-made lakes, reservoirs, and springs. In Sri Lanka, most of the threatened species, which are associated with aquatic habitats, are found in the central highlands with very restricted distribution. Habitat deterioration and degradation, encroachments, clearing of vegetation, water pollution, and spread of invasive alien species are the most significant threats to the highland wetlands. Therefore, demarcation of wetlands, protection of buffer zones, increased public awareness, and implementation of good agricultural practices would certainly bring beneficial changes to the ecosystems.'

Abstract: 'This chapter explores how infrastructure projects help materialise utopian visions of a \xe2\x80\x98new India\xe2\x80\x99. It does this by focussing on the aviation sector and the specific case of a proposed greenfield airport at Mopa located in the state of Goa. It shows how the proposed project deviates from old-styled airports in terms of being conceived as an \xe2\x80\x98airport city\xe2\x80\x99, into a space of consumption, which is itself connected with other utopian projects such as golf courses, marinas, and luxury resorts. Importantly the chapter also demonstrates that such infrastructure projects have generated their own politics of dispossession leading to stiff opposition which has in turn led to the articulation of counter-utopias.'

Title: 'Energy Footprint of India: Scope for Improvements in End-Use Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy'
Author: 'T.\xc2\xa0V.\xc2\xa0Ramachandra'

Abstract: 'Energy plays a pivotal role in the development of a region. Increasing dependency on fossil fuels has caused serious concerns at the local (energy dependency, pollution, etc.) and global (global warming, GHG emission, etc.) levels. Harvesting of energy depends on the availability of resources apart from the economic viability and technical feasibility of meeting the demand. The energy requirement of India is mainly supplied by coal and lignite (19378.24 PJ), followed by crude oil and petroleum products (18432.96 PJ) and electricity (7562.24 PJ). However, energy consumption in rural India is largely dependent on non-conventional energy sources due to the availability, possibility of rapid extraction, and appropriate technologies. Globalization and consequent opening up of Indian markets has led to urbanization with the enhanced energy demand in the industrial and infrastructure sectors. The perishing stock of fossil fuel coupled with the growing concerns of climate change has necessitated the exploration of cost effective, environment friendly, and sustainable energy alternatives. Renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind are emerging as viable alternatives to meet the growing energy demand of the burgeoning population. Strengthening of transmission and distribution network with the integration of local generating units (RE-based standalone units) would help in meeting the demand. Distributed generation (DG) with micro grids are required to minimize transmission and distribution (T and D) losses, and optimal harvesting of abundant local resources (such as solar, biofuel, etc.). The focus of the current communication are (i) understanding the energy scenario in India; (ii) sector- and source-wise energy demand with the scope for energy conservation; and (iii) prospects of renewable energy with smart grids to meet the distributed energy demand while optimizing harvest of local energy sources. Source wise energy analyses reveal that total primary energy consumption has increased manifolds during the past three decades from 18 MTOE (in 1980) to 104 MTOE (2011) in India. Coal consumption has increased from 213 MT (1990\xe2\x80\x9391) to 615 MT (2013\xe2\x80\x9314) and therefore, has grown more than 3 times over the years. Transportation tops in oil consumption (54.28 MTOE) followed by industrial (28.8 MTOE) and domestic (24.89 MTOE) sectors. Total natural gas production in the country was about 18 BCM (billion cubic meters) during 1990\xe2\x80\x9391 and increased to 34.64 BCM now. Electricity generation shows a growth of over 26 times in 40\xc2\xa0years that has increased from 43,724 GWh (1970\xe2\x80\x9371) to 11,79,256 GWh. Renewable energy is being used in various forms as is evident from the dependence on bio-energy to an extent of 85% among the rural population (constitutes 70% of the total) since time immemorial. Grid interactive power generating plants from RE sources constitute 37,414\xc2\xa0MW with the major share of wind energy plants (24376.26\xc2\xa0MW, 65%) followed by biomass/bagasse cogeneration plants (4418.55\xc2\xa0MW, 12%), solar photovoltaic (4346.82\xc2\xa0MW, 12%), and small hydro (4146.82\xc2\xa0MW; 11%). Power generation from municipal solid waste accounts for a very small fraction. Sector-wise and source-wise energy analyses reveal that the energy consumption per GDP (Energy intensity) of India is 0.42 kgoe/million USD. Comparison of the energy intensity (the ratio of energy consumption per GDP) versus GDP per capita of various countries reveal that the energy intensity of India is more than 12 times that of Switzerland, 4 times that of Germany, 3 times that of USA and about 1.3 times that of China, indicating the inefficient use of energy and the need for energy conservation through end use energy efficiency improvements to enhance the GDP with the present level of energy consumption.'

Title: 'Patterns of alien plant diversity in the urban landscapes of global biodiversity hotspots: a case study from the Himalayas'
Author: 'Gousia\xc2\xa0Mehraj'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-017-1478-6
Abstract: 'In an age of Anthropocene, the urban landscapes are recognised as the \xe2\x80\x98hotspots\xe2\x80\x99 of human-mediated alien species introductions. As the cities provide an ideal natural experimental system to investigate the patterns of alien plant diversity in urban landscapes, the present study aimed to unravel the taxonomic, biogeographic and ecological patterns of alien flora of Srinagar\xe2\x80\x94one of the largest urban centres in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. The alien flora of Srinagar comprises 325 species, constituting ca.35% of total flora of the city. Out of the 325 alien species documented, 157 species (43%) were recorded to be under cultivation, while 168 species (57%) were growing in the wild (i.e., outside cultivation); those growing in the wild, in turn, comprised 110 cultivation escapes and 58 accidentally introduced plant species. Biogeographically, two-third of the alien plant diversity reported from Srinagar is native to Asia-Temperate. This indicates that climatic similarity between Asia-Temperate and Kashmir Himalayas facilitate in flourishing similar floristic diversity. The study highlights a relatively higher proportion of herbaceous growth form in the aliens growing in the wild (80%) than those under cultivation (43%). Similarly, 82% of the alien species under cultivation had a perennial life span, but those growing in the wild were dominated by annuals (44%). Currently, 45 species are growing as casuals and 124 species are naturalised (including 105 naturalised non-invasive and 19 naturalised invasive). Along the continuum of casual-naturalised-invasive categories, the contribution of cultivation escapes and accidently introduced aliens contrastingly shows decreasing and increasing trends respectively. Interestingly, the results revealed that the human practice of stopping cultivation of alien escapes increased rapidly as we move along the continuum. Thus, the present study has investigated the patterns of alien plant diversity in the urban landscape of Srinagar, and the results obtained offer scientific insights toward better scientific understanding and management of plant invasions in this Himalayan city, with wider policy implications for neighbouring urbanised landscapes in the Himalayas and other mountainous regions across the world.'

Abstract: 'Apex predators fulfil potentially vital ecological roles. Typically wide-ranging and charismatic, they can also be useful surrogates for biodiversity preservation, making their targeted conservation imperative. The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), an endangered, endemic sub-species, is the island\xe2\x80\x99s apex predator. Of potential keystone importance, this carnivore also fulfills \xe2\x80\x9cumbrella\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cflagship\xe2\x80\x9d criterion and is of high ecological and existence value. Apex predator conservation requires identifying factors underlying distribution, so we used multi-scale maximum entropy modelling with sampling bias correction to investigate a broad suite of relevant ecological, climatic and anthropogenic factors in order to identify potentially suitable leopard habitat. Presence locations were determined from 15\xc2\xa0years of surveys, observations and verified reports. The best bias correction procedure and scale were uncertain, so we employed a novel method of using information from all models across analyses to determine top models and identify influential variables. Leopard presence was most strongly linked to the landscape proportion encompassed by Protected Areas strictly limiting human presence, with more porous Protected Areas less influential. All three forest composition and configuration metrics investigated (area weighted mean patch size, patch density and forest connectivity) were influential, with increased patch size and higher connectivity predicting better habitat suitability for leopards. Habitat suitability was also better where cropland extent and urban patch size were small. In summary, ground-level protection and natural forest extent and connectivity are of profound importance to Sri Lankan leopard distribution and are key factors in ensuring the ecological integrity of the island\xe2\x80\x99s faunal assemblages.'

Author: 'C.\xc2\xa0Sudhakar Reddy'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40010-017-0438-6
Abstract: 'Remote sensing, a state of art technology has gained significance due to its capability to map and monitor compositional, structural and functional biodiversity. Remote sensing data provides a perspective on how ecosystems and species are being affected by the multiple disturbances. This paper presents consolidated information of earth observation based biodiversity research and conservation applications in India. Progress achieved for understanding essential biodiversity variables with reference to species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure have been reviewed. Studies mostly focused on remote sensing based biodiversity indicators in understanding of land cover, forest cover, forest type, fragmentation, biological richness, carbon stocks, fires and protected area monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Fine resolution understanding with reference to vegetation structure, function, distribution of threatened, endemic and invasive species is required for effective conservation strategies. The declining trend of deforestation and effectiveness of protected area network indicates India\xe2\x80\x99s commitment towards the global conservation targets. Ensured continuity of remote sensing can support in near real monitoring of habitats and achieving conservation effectiveness.'

Abstract: 'Strategic bridging of various institutions into a functional network and enhancing communication between the nodes is a low-cost and effective approach for gathering grassroots level information and dissemination of scientific knowledge to various actors of a multi-stakeholder society. Such a cross-talking network of institutions, for example, schools, colleges, nongovernmental organisations, youth clubs and interested individuals, is the heart of participatory research programmes, such as citizen science projects. Although citizen science projects have gained popularity since mid-1990s, very few studies have critically analysed the dynamics and efficacy of interinstitutional networks in India. Here we share our experiences of connecting two major compartments of the educational system, school and college, in the Valanchery region of Malappuram District, Kerala, India, via a \xe2\x80\x98student network\xe2\x80\x99 for a citizen science programme to monitor the local mammalian diversity.'

Abstract: 'This paper discusses the implications of climate change and natural hazards that threaten Indian cities, explores the expected impacts of changing climate and hydro metrological hazard. The study develops a framework for rapid vulnerability assessment of cities by highlighting various risk exposures and vulnerability factors. Urban renewal interventions were identified in order to reduce impacts of climate change. We considered twenty Indian cities from 14 different states. These cities were categorized in terms of population, ecosystems in which they were located such as mountain, coastal, inland and river-based cities ranging from metros, mega cities, and medium sized cities and other characteristics such as commercial, historical, tourism or pilgrimage destinations, capital city, etc. This will help us to better understand the specific drivers of climate vulnerability and provide an information base for future action.'

Title: 'Using the IPBES Conceptual Framework to Study Governance, Institutional Arrangements and Drivers of Biodiversity Loss in Two Indian Cities'
Author: 'Sandhya\xc2\xa0Chandrasekharan'
URL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69474-0_11
Abstract: 'This article draws on a study that used the Conceptual Framework (CF) offered by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) to examine the Convention for Biological Diversity (CBD) theme of Cities and Biodiversity in the Indian metropolitan cities of Chennai and Bengaluru. The focus is one element of the IPBES_CF in particular, \xe2\x80\x98Institutions and governance and other indirect drivers\xe2\x80\x99. These cities, with populations already comparable to those of the largest urban agglomerations globally, are poised for exponential growth. The biodiversity and ecosystem-services related governance challenges that they face in this regard, are substantial. As governance itself is all-encompassing, the primary research in this study was delimited to exploring two key things. The first is the institutional architecture related to, and levels of awareness on biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as the synergy or lack thereof, within the local administration of these cities. The second is on the real estate housing sector as an emerging game-changer in the evolving scenario. Governance of this largely private industry is being attempted through voluntary certification and other soft policy approaches. Examples of good practices by a few builders/companies do exist. However, the scale and pace at which transformative change needs to be facilitated, and the ways and means by which this message can be effectively leveraged, remains a concern.'

Author: 'Ninad\xc2\xa0Avinash\xc2\xa0Mungi'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-018-1666-7
Abstract: 'Presently, it is debated if regional conservation efforts can alone resolve the ecological problems that global climatic changes could bring. Biological invasion is one of such concerns. In the present study, we modeled how change in global climate and regional anthropogenic pressure can impact the distribution of invasive Lantana camara in the Upper Ganga valley of the Western Himalaya (India). The forest in the study area was stratified into 1\xc2\xa0km2 grid and two 15\xc2\xa0m radius plot were located in each of the forest types in the grid, for recording Lantana presence. In total, 2221 plots were sampled covering 22% of forest. We used predictors representing the climate, forest patch size, fire and natural disaster variables for modeling the species distribution using maximum entropy algorithm. We further simulated 12 future landscape scenarios based on the global trends of these parameters. The present species\xe2\x80\x94environment relationship was projected to these future landscape scenarios. Lantana was presently estimated to spread in 231\xc2\xa0km2 of the study area. It invaded larger forest patches in the sub-tropical region, and smaller disturbed forest patches in the warm and cold temperate region. Increased distribution of Lantana was projected across all the future scenarios. The study revealed how global climate changes and regional anthropogenic pressure can have a synergistic effect on the expansion of invasive species in the future. It thus questions the efficiency of conducting only regional efforts in absence of global initiative to reduce the greenhouse gases emission.'

Author: 'Vijayasekaran\xc2\xa0Duraisamy'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-018-6919-5
Abstract: 'The study examines long-term land use/land cover change (LUCC) at a finer scale in a semi-arid region of India. The objectives were to study and quantify the spatiotemporal LUCC and uncover the major drivers causing the change in the Mula Pravara river basin, which is located in a semi-arid region of Maharashtra state, India. Advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 3g data for the years 1982\xe2\x80\x932015 were used to identify the \xe2\x80\x98hotspot\xe2\x80\x99 with significant positive and negative LUCC. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery was used to produce finer scale land use maps. From 1991 to 2016, the agricultural land area increased by approximately 98% due to the conversion of uncultivable and fallow lands to agriculture. The built-up area increased by 195%, and in recent years, an urban expansion has occurred in agricultural lands close to the urban fringe areas. There has been a shift from food crops to commercial crops, as observed from the steep increase in the amount of land under horticultural plantations, by 1601% from 2001 to 2016. In addition, the area under forest canopy was reduced in the protected regions. Institutional factors that improved access to water resources were the major drivers of change in hotspots, especially in the context of agriculture. Technological and economic factors were the other supporting factors that contributed to the change. This study demonstrates the advantages of using satellite remote sensing techniques to monitor the LUCC, which is useful for predicting future land changes and aids in planning adaptation strategies.'

Abstract: 'Root and tuber crops provide a substantial part of the world\xe2\x80\x99s food supply and are also an important source of animal feed and industrial products. The population of India is projected to grow to 1.62 billion by 2050, and the demand for food grains, which is projected to increase to 345 million tons in 2030, can even go up to 360 million tons by 2050. The likely gap in demand-supply could be bridged by crops like cassava and sweet potato, which are concentrated sources of energy. Most of the tuber crops are bestowed with resilience to global warming and climate change, potential for better return under adverse soil and weather conditions, diverse industrial applications and nutritional attributes, and most of all exceptionally high CO2 fixation potential. In terms of annual volume of production, cassava and sweet potato rank among the top 10 food crops produced in developing countries. The information on World and Indian scenario, area, production, and productivity, SWOT analysis, gap areas identified, and thrust areas for tropical root and tuber crops, is provided.'

Title: 'Adaptation Strategies to Counter Climate Change Impact on Sheep'
Author: 'Veerasamy\xc2\xa0Sejian'

Abstract: 'Climate change has proved to impose potential negative effects on species survival, ecosystems stability and sustainable livestock production around the globe. Among the various environmental factors, heat stress is well known for its harmful effects on livestock and related production losses. Sheep exposed to heat stress show lower body growth and hide quality and compromised reproductive functions in both males and females. Adapting to the changing climate requires appropriate manipulations in the production system by taking into account the positive effects and attempting to diminish the negative effects of climate change. The highly adapted indigenous breeds identified by marker-assisted selection can be used as an efficient tool for developing thermotolerant breeds through improved breeding programmes. Promotion of such breeds can improve production efficiency and may lead to fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Further, the local people, especially women, are good managers of natural resources and possess excellent skills to utilize the natural resources efficiently. Hence, occasional training and a participatory research approach into the roles of women assist the tackling of climate change in the rural areas. In addition, well-organized early warning systems avoid severe damage due to unexpected disasters by providing sufficient time to prepare effective responses. Development of skilled disease surveillance supported with effective health services may effectively control the spread of climate change-related diseases in sheep. Furthermore, the production system requires improved water resource management to provide sufficient water for sheep production in the arid and semi-arid regions. Cultivation of drought-tolerant fodder varieties in extremely hot areas is an efficient adaptive strategy to ensure sufficient supply of feed during scarcity periods. Finally, strengthening extension services and building awareness through capacity-building programmes helps the livestock keepers to improve their adaptive capacities against climate change. Adaptation strategies related to cold stress include advanced cold-tolerant breeding programmes, migration in extreme winter and adoption of proper cold management practices. According to the predictions by various international bodies, the consequences of climate change will be on the rise in the future. Hence, adequate cost-effective management strategies appear to be the immediate need of the hour for adapting sheep production systems to the changing climate.'

Abstract: 'The Indian Sundarbans is one of the most backward regions in South Asia despite being a critical global commons because of its unique biodiversity including the endangered Royal Bengal Tiger. Characterised by subsistence economy, the region records very high level of poverty. Local livelihoods largely depend on natural resources which are either dwindling fast (fish) or becoming unproductive (increasing salination making agriculture increasingly difficult). While there is a clear aspirational shift towards more formal livelihoods such as white-collar professions, the daily unproductive livelihood negotiations are becoming serious threats to long-term sustenance and sustainability of the socioecological system. The built capital or the infrastructure is poorly developed which make it difficult for the locals to realise the true productive capacity of the region. This also fails to bolster human capital that can enable informed choices about the household-level aspirational trajectories. Rapid environmental shifts because of global warming interact with these developmental and governance deficits to co-produce hazards daily for the residents.'

Abstract: 'The sustainable livelihood framework is a widely used approach to analyze changes in rural livelihoods, especially in resource dependent communities. The framework emphasizes that given a certain situation where the livelihood context, resources and institutions remain favourable, livelihood strategies carried out by people could possibly lead to two different outcomes. One, the results of livelihood strategies will produce sustainable outcomes providing affected households respite from the impacts of livelihood loss. Two, there is a possibility that resulting outcomes may not be sufficient to reverse livelihood crisis and may not necessarily result in sustainable livelihood because of the complexities, uncertainties and multilevel drivers associated with it. This paper aims to evaluate both these possibilities through use of empirical data to clarify factors and conditions that may impede sustainable livelihood outcomes despite well planned strategies. It highlights that availability of more resources (or capitals) do not necessarily contribute to more robust livelihood strategies or outcomes. Using the case of small scale fishery-based livelihood system of Chilika Lagoon, Bay of Bengal in the East coast of India, this paper suggests that the relationship between livelihood shocks and stresses, capitals, institutions and livelihood strategies is circular and not linear.'

Abstract: 'Uneven and combined urban development is a hallmark of the changing Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Mumbai\xe2\x80\x99s coastline urbanism is markedly different from the dominant urbanisms in the city centre. The growth that makes the city centre a global destination is experienced as phantom violations of nature at the edges. The effects of CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) rules and their violations in the MMR have reconstituted the urban in the seashores, with huge impacts on the traditional fishing communities. The marginal people at the marginal spaces are in the receiving end of Mumbai\xe2\x80\x99s quest to become a global city. The resultant intensified urbanization leads to the destruction of mangrove forests and coastal ecosystems, which are crucial in sustaining biodiversity; high population density and uneven growth have exacerbated environmental and socio-economic consequences. The Koli (fishing community) in this region face problems of survival and sustenance in small-scale fishing, due to the rampant commercial fishing by big trawlers and large-scale dumping of waste materials by the industries in the vicinity into the sea. This paper focuses on the transformation of spaces and activities related to the lives of fishing community that is worst affected by encroachment on coastal areas and rampant CRZ violations. It discusses the frequent reclassification of CRZ rules in order to facilitate many developmental projects like Special Economic Zone (SEZs). Within the larger context of evolving urbanisms in the coastal areas of Mumbai, the broader issues related to the contradictions and complementarities involved in Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) plans vis-\xc3\xa0-vis management of biodiversity are scrutinized in the study.'

Abstract: 'The phenomenon of climate change is widely known as statistical change in climatic properties over a specified period of time. The forest sector had been mostly reactive towards it as some effects of climate change are already noticeable and there is a need to be better prepared for future change. Present study gives an idea about impact of extreme climatic events on forest ecosystem of Uttarakhand. The results showed that a long dry period without rains had lead to efficient conditions for fire initiation which is a regular phenomenon during summer season in this region. Eventually the extreme fire incidents peaked during April\xe2\x80\x93May 2016 and almost every forest of 13 districts of this region was affected. These incidents ultimately affected the precious ecosystem of this biodiversity rich region, increased the temperature and affected the air quality and lead to decline in livelihood services depending upon native forests. Findings of the present study will be beneficial for the further assessment of the likely impacts of climate change events on forests, forest-dependent people and their vulnerabilities which are important for enhancing climate change adaptation as it forms the basis for sustainable development options to avoid harmful effects of climate change in near future.'

Title: 'Tree seedling establishment in dry tropics: an urgent need of interaction studies'
Author: 'Rahul\xc2\xa0Bhadouria'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-017-9625-x
Abstract: 'The current anthropogenic activities and climate change are increasingly becoming a growing global concern for dry tropical forests. Worldwide, these ecologically important forests have degraded considerably since the past few decades due to such factors. These factors have harmful consequences on the vegetation structure and diversity especially tree seedlings, which may further aggravate climate change. Generally, the vegetation recovery is very slow and unpredictable in the dry tropics due to complex interaction among tree seedling, site (particularly, soil) and climatic conditions. We inculcated that a better understanding of the behavior of individuals of different tree species at seedling stage in dry forests is of immense importance. It is increasingly being recognized for explaining and managing the future composition of plant communities under changing environmental conditions. In this regard, the multi-factorial interaction studies under various resource\xe2\x80\x93disturbance combinations are needed in dry tropical ecosystems to understand the: (1) impact of relative variability in resources and disturbances on the responses of tree seedlings of native species and (2) how the later relates to distinct functional and life history traits of the individual tree species. Most importantly, such studies would improve our limited understanding of how variation (natural and man-made) in nutrient availability, under the influence of other local environmental factors (such as water, light, grass competition, herbivory, fire, allelopathy and enhanced CO2 conditions), would affect the dynamics of dry tropical forest community. It may help in the proper management of these forests. Moreover, it may prove helpful in the current climate change scenario, as change in forest community dynamics may have consequences on soil C sequestration and CO2 efflux at global scale.'

Title: 'Assessing embodied GHG emission reduction potential of cost-effective technologies for construction of residential buildings of Economically Weaker Section in India'
Author: 'Nilanjan\xc2\xa0Sengupta'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42107-018-0013-8
Abstract: 'In persuasion of global commitment of the country on reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission, India\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98National Mission on Sustainable Habitat\xe2\x80\x99 has included promotion of energy efficiency in residential and commercial sector and has envisaged that energy use in buildings varies significantly across income groups, building construction typology, climate and several other factors. Though substantial energy savings can be achieved in the housing sector through implementation of various carbon mitigation options, it was stated that the incremental cost of implementing energy efficient measures is estimated to vary between 3 and 5% for residential houses. The challenge before the engineers, architects and other professionals associated with building construction sector is to find out appropriate technologies that will ensure reduction of GHG emission without increasing cost of construction. As majority of construction in government sector will come from construction of small residential house belonging to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as part of government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to provide housing for all by 2020, assessment of GHG reduction potential of various cost-effective construction technologies is very essential to provide guidance to the stakeholders. This paper has surveyed various prevalent construction technologies in different parts of the country, analyzed the cost and embodied GHG emission for construction of the building envelope by collecting data through extensive search of literature and information obtained from construction sites. It has been found that there is ample scope of adoption of location-specific, cost-effective and eco-friendly construction technologies for construction of houses for EWS which are capable of reduction of GHG emission without any increase in cost of construction. The technologies can meet the commitment of the country at international level on reduction of GHG emission without any extra burden to state exchequer.'

Author: 'Wen\xc2\xa0Zhuang'

Abstract: 'The objective reality of uneven water resource distribution and imbalanced water demand of the human society makes it inevitable to transfer water. It has been an age-old method to adopt the inter-basin water transfers (IBTs) for alleviating and even resolving the urgent demand of the water-deficient areas. A number of countries have made attempts and have achieved enormous benefits. However, IBTs inevitably involve the redistribution of water resources in relevant basins and may cause changes of the ecological environment in different basins. Such changes are two-sided, namely, the positive impacts, including adding new basins for water-deficient areas, facilitating water cycle, improving meteorological conditions in the recipient basins, mitigating ecological water shortage, repairing the damaged ecological system, and preserving the endangered wild fauna and flora, as well as the negative impacts, including salinization and aridification of the donor basins, damage to the ecological environment of the donor basins and the both sides of the conveying channel system, increase of water consumption in the recipient basins, and spread of diseases, etc. Because IBTs have enormous ecological risk, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the inter-basin water balance relationship, coordinate the possible conflicts and environmental quality problems between regions, and strengthen the argumentation of the ecological risk of water transfer and eco-compensation measures. In addition, there are some effective alternative measures for IBTs, such as attaching importance to water cycle, improving water use efficiency, developing sea water desalination, and rainwater harvesting technology, etc.'

Title: 'How do we assess vulnerability to climate change in India? A systematic review of literature'
Author: 'Chandni\xc2\xa0Singh'
URL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-016-1043-y
Abstract: 'In countries like India where multiple risks interact with socio-economic differences to create and sustain vulnerability, assessing the vulnerability of people, places, and systems to climate change is a critical tool to prioritise adaptation. In India, several vulnerability assessment tools have been designed spanning multiple disciplines, by multiple actors, and at multiple scales. However, their conceptual, methodological, and disciplinary underpinnings, and resulting implications on who is identified as vulnerable, have not been interrogated. Addressing this gap, we systematically review peer-reviewed publications (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa078) and grey literature (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa042) to characterise how vulnerability to climate change is assessed in India. We frame our enquiry against four questions: (1) How is vulnerability conceptualised (vulnerability of whom/what, vulnerability to what), (2) who assesses vulnerability, (3) how is vulnerability assessed (methodology, scale), and (4) what are the implications of methodology on outcomes of the assessment. Our findings emphasise that methods to assess vulnerability to climate change are embedded in the disciplinary traditions, methodological approaches, and often-unstated motivations of those designing the assessment. Further, while most assessments acknowledge the importance of scalar and temporal aspects of vulnerability, we find few examples of it being integrated in methodology. Such methodological myopia potentially overlooks how social differentiation, ecological shifts, and institutional dynamics construct and perpetuate vulnerability. Finally, we synthesise the strengths and weaknesses of current vulnerability assessment methods in India and identify a predominance of research in rural landscapes with a relatively lower coverage in urban and peri-urban settlements, which are key interfaces of transitions.'

Abstract: 'The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (shortened to \xe2\x80\x9cMaritime Silk Road\xe2\x80\x9d hereafter) initiative represents China\xe2\x80\x99s consistent theme of peace and development. It is conducive to achieve common prosperity and progress of human society. However, challenges and opportunities often coexist. The Maritime Silk Road links the South China Sea and the northern Indian Ocean, involving a large number of countries, a wide range, and long distances. The challenging natural environment, scarcity of electricity and freshwater resources, different political and cultural bases, etc. greatly increase the difficulty of constructing the Maritime Silk Road. Obviously, an understanding the characteristics of the marine environment, energy, legal counsel and so on is a prerequisite for the safe and efficient construction of the Maritime Silk Road. However, relatively weak basic research and scarce marine data seriously restrict the full implementation of the Maritime Silk Road initiative and urgently need to be addressed. This chapter discusses the significance and challenges of the Maritime Silk Road initiative and provides corresponding countermeasures.'

Abstract: 'This chapter introduces Badagas, an ethnic minority in India, and their general portrayal by scholars. Drawing on literature since the colonial era, it reviews different representations, collectively a social construction of a distinct cultural and ethnic identity category for a specific population and way of life\xe2\x80\x94a popular imagination of a hill tribe in a remote region bound by strong ties to ancient myths and rituals, kinship, and land. Colonists, missionaries, and early intellectuals gave the false appearance of coherence to people in othering and social boundary-making processes, a mindset grounded in European colonial expansion and early anthropology. Later writers uncritically adopted and reinscribed a reified identity through detailed investigations of its defining criteria, and in this way misleading stereotypes have been stamped in the literature over many years. Another aim of the chapter is to pinpoint what is already known about Badagas, as well as gaps in knowledge, to make a case for the empirical research reported in this book which is a multi-sited ethnography of life quality and identities among Badagas in two connected locations, the first online among Internet forum users, and the second in the real world with rural-to-urban migrants in Bangalore.'

Abstract: 'Increase in the number and area of waste dumpsites is a major concern worldwide due to modern urbanization, industrial revolution and overpopulation growth. There is a wide range of waste dumpsites such as fly ash dumps, mine spoils, red mud deposits, sewage sludge, etc. These waste dumps are a source of heavy metal pollution, the degradation of soil and water system and serious dust pollution to atmosphere. These are also recognized as ecological, economic and social challenges. Thus, the management of waste dumpsites in a safe and economic way is still a worldwide challenge. In this direction, the phytomanagement of waste dumpsites through energy plantation is a holistic approach for ecological, economic and social sustainability.'

Abstract: 'Vulnerability assessments can play a vital role in the design of appropriate adaptation and mitigation policies targeted towards climate change and its impacts on ecosystems, and those who depend upon these resources for their livelihoods and well-being. Vulnerability is often reflected in the state of the economic system as well as the socio-economic features of the population living in that system. The current paper attempts to build a picture of the socio-economic context of vulnerability by focusing on indicators that measure both the state of development of the people as well as its capacity to progress further. The result of agricultural vulnerability index suggests indicators like cropping intensity, gross irrigated area and commercial crop area that are the major drivers in determining the vulnerability of districts of Karnataka. The socio-economic index depicts indicators like per capita income, population density and percentage of literacy rate that are the major drivers and contribute to the overall livelihood vulnerability of districts.'

Abstract: 'Wild edibles continue to be a significant contributor to the global food basket in much of the developing world. A consensus has now been formed that information on wild edibles is an important part of ethnobotanical knowledge and hence elucidating region-specific patterns of habitat management and consumption assists policy making with regard to natural conservation, human nutrition, and human health. Using an original data set from Gujarat, India, the present research aims to document the collective knowledge of wild edibles possessed by the local Vasava tribe, as well as the habitat usage and consumption trends of these species.'

Abstract: 'Remote sensing can be defined as the process of measuring the physical properties of distant objects using reflected or emitted energy [1]. Remote Sensing (RS) refers to the science of identification of earth surface features and estimation of their geo-biophysical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information [2, 3]. Remote Sensing data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods [4, 5].\n'
