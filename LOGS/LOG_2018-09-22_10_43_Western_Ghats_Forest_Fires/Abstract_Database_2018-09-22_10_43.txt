Abstract: 'AbstractThe Kondapalli reserve forest (KRF) of the Eastern Ghats, India is subjected to severe anthropogenic interference, despite its status as reserve forest. The present research focuses on assessing the land use and land cover changes in and around KRF using temporal satellite data. It is evident from the current study that there has been a considerable decrease in the forest cover from 1990 to 2015; as seen from 2017 data, huge urban expansions and development activities were observed around KRF. This increase is linked to the growth in population, thereby consuming land available for their basic needs. To assess the rate of urban expansion around the forest, Land consumption rate and Land absorption coefficient were computed. The result of this analysis showed a rapid growth in built-up land between 1990 and 2017 while the periods between 1990 and 2015 witnessed a reduction in the forest class. Further, the study projected adverse impact of the growth of the new capital city-Amaravati on the KRF and proposed requiring suitable conservation measures with respect to its current deforestation and degradation trends.'

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2Predictors were assessed using presence-only and bootstrap.\xe2\x80\xa2Climate change significantly decline species suitable distribution.\xe2\x80\xa2Results indicated an excellent accuracy in Maxent outputs.\xe2\x80\xa2Temperature seasonality and isothermality contribute the maximum to the distribution Garcinia indica.\xe2\x80\xa2Predicted suitability and predictors contribution could help conservation planning and management.AbstractIn recent years, climate change has become a major threat and has been widely documented in the geographic distribution of many plant species. However, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of ecologically vulnerable medicinal species remain largely unknown. The identification of a suitable habitat for a species under climate change scenario is a significant step towards the mitigation of biodiversity decline. The study, therefore, aims to predict the impact of current, and future climatic scenarios on the distribution of the threatened Garcinia indica across the northern Western Ghats using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. The future projections were made for the year 2050 and 2070 with all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenario (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) using 56 species occurrence data, and 19 bioclimatic predictors from the BCC-CSM1.1 model of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change\xe2\x80\x99s (IPCC) 5th assessment. The bioclimatic variables were minimised to a smaller number of variables after a multicollinearity test, and their contributions were assessed using jackknife test. The AUC value of 0.956\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.023 indicates that the model performs with excellent accuracy. The study identified that temperature seasonality (39.5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf3.1%), isothermality (19.2\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.6%), and annual precipitation (12.7\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.7%) would be the major influencing variables in the current and future distribution. The model predicted 10.50% (19318.7\xe2\x80\xafsq.\xe2\x80\xafkm) of the study area as moderately to very highly suitable, while 82.60% (151904\xe2\x80\xafsq.\xe2\x80\xafkm) of the study area was identified as \xe2\x80\x98unsuitable\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98very low suitable\xe2\x80\x99. Our predictions of Climate change impact on habitat suitability suggest that there will be a drastic reduction in the suitability by 5.29% and 5.69% under RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070, respectively.Objective and SignificancePrimary objective of this study is to identify the potential distribution of medicinally and ecologically important but threatened Garcinia indica species in the northern Western Ghats on the basis of species occurrence data and nineteen bioclimatic predictors. Using MaxEnt modelling, current and future species distribution and suitability has been predicted using the BCC-CSM1.1 and four RCP scenarios of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. The results also signify the bioclimatic variables contribution to the species distribution in northern Western Ghats.Finally, the results signify that the model might be an efficient tool for biodiversity protection, ecosystem management, and species re-habitation planning under future climate change scenarios.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (208KB)Download full-size image'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnplanned large scale developmental projects in recent times have been causing alterations in land use land cover [LULC] at spatial and temporal scales with the substantial changes in the landscape. Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human\xe2\x80\x93animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355\xc2\xa0Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072\xc2\xa0Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022. This necessitates framing appropriate policy measures to sustain natural resources focusing on the landscape\xe2\x80\x99s ecological, hydrological, economic and social factors.'

Abstract: 'AbstractThe ecological integrity is widely discussed as a new concept by several ecologists and environmentalists. A consensus in this regard is yet to be derived for its definition. Human intervention for its developmental activities results in several environmental changes that enhance some species, ecosystem and ecological processes while at the same time brings irrecoverable damage to the Planet Earth. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The focus of this paper is to emphasize the organized urban planning at a macro level and the architectural design interventions at the micro level in Vijayawada where eco \xe2\x80\x93 sensitivity exists with due consideration to ecological integrity and environmental protection. The ecological dynamics of continuity indicated that hillocks of Vijayawada region are a part of Eastern Ghats. The study is to elaborate that the landscape, eco-patches and its connectivity establishes a unique corridor to strengthen ecological system and as a green corridor to Vijayawada city to fulfill the demands of the city and also to create the ecological patch connectivity to scattered Eastern Ghats especially in the Krishna-Guntur region which connects the Nallamala hills through Kondapalli hill toward Sothern side and to the Papikondalu at the northern side of Eastern Ghats. These corridors may even support environmental conservation and provides rural edge in urban context and functions as lung spaces to ease the heat island effect of urban settlement. So the explicit development controls have been derived to guide and organize at micro level so as to achieve the macro level considerations of ecological integrity.'

Abstract: 'AbstractMonitoring the changes in forest-cover and understanding the dynamics of the forest is becoming increasingly important for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses temporal MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field (MODIS-VCF) to monitor the tree cover change in the Indian region over a period of 6\xc2\xa0years (2000\xe2\x80\x932005). Pixel-based linear regression model is developed to identify rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The regression parameters viz., slope, offset and variance are used to identify threshold between forest and non-forest classes. The classification algorithm resulted into change area, no change area, positive change and negative changes. MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using the field data and showed a coefficient of determination (R2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.85) between percent tree cover and individual plot wise canopy cover information. The results were overlaid with UNEP protected area boundary. On a long-term basis, the forest cover change was monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat and IRS) satellite data to identify the rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The developed approach is efficient and effective for regional monitoring of forest cover change. It could be automated for regular usage and monitoring.'

Abstract: 'AbstractUnderstanding carbon stocks relative to tree species is important for managing tropical forests in a way that will result in the carbon emission reductions and biodiversity conservation required under the REDD+\xc2\xa0scheme. Here we analyse inventory data from 179 sample plots in semi-evergreen forests of three provinces in Cambodia. Across all study sites, 5,995 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) \xe2\x89\xa510\xc2\xa0cm, comprising 79 species from 38 families, were analysed. Tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae were most common (10 species), followed by the species of Caesalpinaceae, Combretaceae and Ebenaceae. Analysis of relative carbon stocks (RCS) suggested that Lagerstroemia calyculata Kurz (RCS=14.3%), Syzygium sp. (6.8%), Shorea vulgaris (5.0%), Irvingia malayana (4.8%), Anisoptera costata Kort (4.6%), Vatica astrotricha (4.2%), and Dehaasia cuneata Blume (3.8%) together accounted for 43.6% of the total average carbon stocks of 99.8\xc2\xb14.8\xc2\xa0MgC\xc2\xa0ha\xe2\x88\x921. We found that carbon stock is highly correlated to basal area (R2=0.993) but not to stem density (R2=0.153). Using carbon stock values, we estimated the carbon emission due to deforestation of semi-evergreen forests to be 8.3\xc2\xa0TgCO2 \xc2\xa0year\xe2\x88\x921 in Cambodia between 2002 and 2010. These emissions and the loss of 79 tree species in our study sites could be avoided if financial incentives were available for protecting semi-evergreen forests in Cambodia.'

Abstract: "AbstractObjectiveTo report the patterns of species diversity, and regenerating capacity in the forest of Nikyal valley in relation to environmental variables and underlying anthropogenic influence.MethodsA study area was selected in a traditionally managed mountain woody pasture during July 2012 to June 2013. The area was sampled by quadrat method. The quadrats were laid down at regular intervals of 150 m. The size of quadrats was kept 10\xc3\x9710, 5\xc3\x975 and 1\xc3\x971 m2 for trees, shrubs and herbs respectively. Density, frequency and cover were recorded. Importance value index of each plant species was calculated and plant communities were named after the plant species having the highest IV. Then diversity, its components and regenerating capacity were calculated with their formulas.ResultsShannon's diversity ranged from 2.75 to 3.31, Simpson's diversity, 0.90 to 0.95; Menhinick's diversity, 0.83 to 1.19; evenness, 0.41 to 0.65; species richness, 4.89 to 6.08 and maturity index, 30 to 44 species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests. Pinus roxburghaii was the only regenerating species whereas the remaining four tree species including Qurecus dilatata regenerate up to 100 cm; they are at extreme risk of elimination due to anthropogenic factors.ConclusionsNikyal valley is under severe deforestation pressure for fuel and timber value. There is an urgent need to promote the ethics among the people that improvement and conservation of natural resources are critical for land and soil management."

Title: 'Shifting cultivators in South Asia: Expansion, marginalisation and specialisation over the long term'
Author: 'Eleanor'
URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618211002989
Abstract: 'AbstractThis paper will consider alternative perspectives on the long-term history of shifting cultivation in India and Sri Lanka. Ethnographic and historical accounts of shifting cultivation, often by groups marginal to centres of urbanism and agrarian civilisation, are reviewed. Shifting cultivation persists in hill regions which are more marginal for sedentary, high intensity agriculture and state procurement of taxation. This can be considered as a strategy both to exploit more marginal lands and to avoid state domination. The origins of this historical equilibrium are hypothesized to lie with the expansion of later Neolithic agriculture (4000\xe2\x80\x933000 BP) and the development of hierarchical polities in the Indian plains in the Iron Age (mainly after 3000 BP). The archaeological record of early agriculture indicates that cultivation precedes sedentary villages, suggesting that shifting cultivation may have been a widespread economic system in the Neolithic, in both the Ganges Valley and the Deccan Plateau of South India. These areas are more suited to sedentary cultivation that could support higher population densities. Therefore, as populations grew in the Neolithic the economic system shifted to sedentary agriculture. The expansion of trade networks, hierarchical societies and demographic density pushed shifting cultivation practices into increasingly marginal settings, where this became an interdependent strategy. Specialist hunter\xe2\x80\x93gatherers trading in forest products became an increasingly important aspect of forest exploitation as did cultivation of \xe2\x80\x98cash crop trees\xe2\x80\x99. The potential to detect the effect of some of these processes in archaeological and palynological evidence is explored.'

We hypothesize that the lack of trees in grasslands is due to the scarcity of gaps suitable for tree seedling establishment in the grass root layer. We assessed which demographic bottlenecks, seedling recruitment or sapling release, were limiting large tree populations of Acacia species in 229 sites on a gradient from lowland savannas to upland grasslands in eastern South Africa. We explored the frequency of \xe2\x80\x98root gaps\xe2\x80\x99 by quantifying grass root biomass in grids of 18 points at six sites distributed from lowland savannas to upland grasslands.Across the altitudinal gradient, sapling release was the most common bottleneck at low elevation sites switching to seedling recruitment in upland savannas and adjacent grasslands. Root studies showed grass root biomass at upland sites to be double than that of lowland sites. When grass root biomass of all 108 sample points was ranked, lowland savanna sites had the most frequent \xe2\x80\x98gaps\xe2\x80\x99 defined as the lowest percentiles of values (5, 15, 25, 35, 45). The number of \xe2\x80\x98gaps\xe2\x80\x99 decreased along the elevation gradient with none in the grassland site. Dense grass roots may prevent seedling establishment and \xe2\x80\x98root gaps\xe2\x80\x99 may be safe sites with reduced competition where seedlings can establish. We suggest that a lack of root gaps could explain the treeless nature of many upland grasslands.'

Abstract: 'AbstractSaraca asoca (Fabaceae) is a prime ingredient in Asokarishta, a well-known Ayurvedic preparation for gynecological ailments. Due to scarcity, adulteration or substitution of related raw drugs is a common practice in its preparation. The bark of Kingiodendron pinnatum (Roxb. ex DC.) Harms, morphologically similar to S.\xc2\xa0asoca (Asoka) is a widely used substitute. The present study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effectiveness of K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum as an alternative for S.\xc2\xa0asoca in Asokarishta by determining the inhibitory effect of estrogen induced uterus endometrial thickening in immature female rats. Arishta was prepared using S.\xc2\xa0asoca and with the substitute, K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia. Uterus endometrial thickening was induced by the administration of estradiol (20\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/kg b. wt, i.p) to 8-day-old rats for 5 alternate days. On day 16, following estradiol administration, the serum estrogen level was found elevated to 156.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08\xc2\xa0pg/ml from the normal value 32.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0pg/ml and consequently increased the thickness of uterus endometrium from 16.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.4 to 75.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa015.3\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm. Upon oral administration of 400\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcl/kg b. wt Asokarishta (ASA) and Arishta made with K.\xc2\xa0pinnatum (AKP), the thickening was reduced to 42.5\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa012.7 and 47.1\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa010.5\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcm and the estrogen level diminished to 102.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa010 and 97.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08\xc2\xa0pg/ml, respectively.

Abstract: 'Highlights\xe2\x80\xa2To conserve the tiger it is critical to enable the persistence of the species across larger landscapes.\xe2\x80\xa2Establishing protected areas for tiger recovery remains one of the means of landscape approach.\xe2\x80\xa2While the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient.\xe2\x80\xa2It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process that enable the recovery of tigers.AbstractTo conserve a large, wide-ranging carnivore like the tiger, it is critical not only to maintain populations at key habitat sites, but also to enable the persistence of the species across much larger landscapes. To do this, it is important to establish well-linked habitat networks where sites for survival and reproduction of tigers are complemented by opportunities for dispersal and colonization. On the ground, expanding protection to areas with a potential for tiger recovery still remains the means of operationalizing the landscape approach. Yet, while the gazetting of protected areas is necessary to enable this, it is not sufficient. It is essential to benchmark and monitor the process by which establishment of protected areas must necessarily be followed by management changes that enable a recovery of tigers, their prey and their habitats. In this paper, we report a case study from the Cauvery and Malai Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuaries of southern India, where we document the infrastructural and institutional changes that ensued after an unprecedented expansion of protected areas in this landscape. Further, we establish ecological benchmarks of the abundance and distribution of tigers, the relative abundance of their prey, and the status of their habitats, against which the recovery of tigers in this area of vast conservation potential may be assessed over time.'

The paper has made an effort to analyze theprocess of FBC as a genuine tool to establish the association ofphysical form and spaces with the public realm to uphold thecontext and culture by taking a case in the heritage rich centralcommercial core of Thiruvananthapuram city, Chalai. Chalai isundergoing a tremendous transformation in its physical formdisregarding its strong culture and context and this can influencethe inherent native character of the bazaar activity and looses itsidentity in form and function. In this regard form Based Codingwill be a suitable tool to strengthen it as a native bazaar for thecity.A detailed documentation of form in relation with the existing layers of street pattern, activity, building types, and function is analysed and its influences to variations in form is studied. The existing codes of the built form of different uses were decoded. The comparison of existing codes with the theoretical parameters from literature and case studies lead to the formulation of codes with FBC as a tool suitable for the context."
