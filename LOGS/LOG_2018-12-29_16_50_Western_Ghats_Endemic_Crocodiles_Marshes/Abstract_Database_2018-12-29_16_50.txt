Abstract: 'Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the \xe2\x80\x98ecological units\xe2\x80\x99 with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR (1\xe2\x80\x934) through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.'

Title: 'Hotspots: An Introduction and Role in Conservation'

Abstract: 'Biodiversity is integral to the direct benefits that humans receive from nature besides ecosystem services. However, human activities and the negative consequences of climate change are accelerating the loss of biodiversity. There are multiple indications of continuing decline in biodiversity in all three of its components\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 ecosystems, species and genes. In order to receive continuous ecosystem services and protect the species from extinction, 35 global biodiversity hotspots have been identified for conservation. It is nothing but a biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened with destruction. The tropical island of Andaman and Nicobar is part of the global biodiversity hotspot having a large number of flora and fauna besides exhibiting great endemism. The recent assessment showed that the plant diversity of these islands comprises 3219 species under 1251 genera belonging to angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes, bryophytes, lichens and algae. Similarly 1463 species of fishes, 600\xc2\xa0species of corals, 120 species of sponges, 290\xc2\xa0species of butterflies, 300\xc2\xa0species of birds and 36\xc2\xa0species of mangroves were\xc2\xa0recorded. They are imperative for the livelihood of local people, a treasure for humankind; therefore, efforts should be made to strengthen the conservation efforts and preservation of threatened floral and faunal diversity of these islands.'

Abstract: 'Climate change is a vital environmental issue affecting nature and distribution of biodiversity. As the economy of developing countries depends primarily upon climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and forestry, a holistic analysis of climate change and its implications on biodiversity is warranted in order to achieve sustainable development. The impacts of climate change on critical ecosystems and livelihood activities and on insert biological resources, especially those that are vulnerable due to other prevailing anthropogenic interventions, are discussed in the chapter. The strategies to reduce climate change impacts, including adaptation and mitigation measures, which integrate ecosystem approach into broader cross-sectoral policies as a compliment to structural and technological measures, would ultimately help achieving the targets set for biodiversity conservation. The ecosystem approach of the Convention on Biological Diversity provides a flexible management framework to address climate change mitigation and adaptation activities in a broad perspective and can help to balance ecological, economic and social considerations in projects, programmes and policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The research options on the appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies so as to manage the rich biodiversity and to specifically address the impacts of climate change on species and ecosystems coupled with the need to integrate biodiversity into developmental plans and policies are discussed.'

Abstract: 'The tropics are affected by a growing range of developments, which replicate what has been happening in developed nations over centuries within decades, even years at times, and at much larger scales. There are also newly emerging threats such as GM, mining and explorations at gigantic scales, mega-hydrodevelopment, and a host of new chemicals, some of them, like neonicotinoids, with systemic, long-term, and unknown impacts. An unprecedented assault takes place on ecosystems and their species through intensifying land uses to feed a growing human population, which consumes more and more per capita. \xe2\x80\x9cSuper crops\xe2\x80\x9d such as oil palm and soy bean, increasingly genetically modified, to provide fuel, food, and fiber, replace natural forests and ecosystems at great and growing scales resulting in shrinking wildlife habitats and populations. And now, the threat of a changing climate has been added to all that.'
