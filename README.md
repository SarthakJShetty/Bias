## 1.0 Introduction:

- Academic publishing has risen X-fold in the past ten years, making it nearly impossible to sift through a large number of papers and identify broad areas of research within disciplines.

<img src="assets/Increase.png" alt="Increase in number of scientific publications">

<i>***Figure 1.1*** Increase in the number of scientific publications in the fields of physics and chemistry [1].</i>

- In order to *understand* such vast volumes of research, there is a need for **automated text analysis tools**.

- However, existing tools such as *Leximancer* are **expensive and lack in-depth analysis of publications**.

- To address these issues, we developed ***pyResearchThemes***, an **open-source, automated text analysis tool** that:
	- **Scrape** papers from scientific repositories,
	- **Analyse** meta-data such as date and journal of publication,
	- **Visualizes** themes of research using natural language processing.

- To demonstrate the ability of the tool, we have analyzed the research themes from the field of Ecology & Conservation.

### 1.1 About:

This project is a collaboration between <a title="Sarthak" href="https://SarthakJShetty.github.io" target="_blank"> Sarthak J. Shetty</a>, from the <a title="Aerospace Engineering" href="https://aero.iisc.ac.in" >Department of Aerospace Engineering</a>, <a title="IISc" href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Science</a> and <a title="Vijay" href="https://evolecol.weebly.com/" target="_blank"> Vijay Ramesh</a>, from the <a title="E3B" href="http://e3b.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Ecology, Evolution & Environmental Biology</a>, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" title="Columbia University" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>.

## 2.0 Model Overview:

- The model is made up of three parts:

	1. <strong><a title="Scraper" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Scraper.py/">Scraper</a>:</strong> This component scrapes scientific repository for publications containing the specific combination of keywords.

	2. <strong><a title="Cleaner" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Cleaner.py/">Cleaner</a>:</strong> This component cleans the corpus of text retreived from the repository and rids it of special characters that creep in during formatting and submission of manuscripts.

	3. <strong><a title="Analyzer" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Analyzer.py/">Analyzer</a>:</strong> This component collects and measures the frequency of select keywords in the abstracts database.

	4. <strong><a title="NLP Engine" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/NLP_Engine.py/">NLP Engine</a>:</strong> This component extracts insights from the abstracts collected by presenting topic modelling.

	5. <strong><a title="Visualizer" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Visualizer.py/">Visualizer</a>:</strong> This component presents the results and data from the Analyzer to the end user.

## 3.0 How it works:

<img src="assets/Bias.png" alt="Bias Pipeline">

<i>***Figure 3.1*** Diagramatic representation of pipeline for collecting papers and generating visualizations.</i>

### 3.1 Scraper:
- The <a title="Scraper" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/Scraper.py">```Scraper.py```</a> currently scrapes only the abstracts from <a title="Springer" href="https://www.link.Springer.com" target="_blank">Springer</a>  using the <a title="BeautifulSoup" href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a> and <a title="urllib" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request" target="_blank">urllib</a> packages.

- A default URL is provided in the code. Once the keywords are provided, the URLs are queried and the resultant webpage is souped and ```abstract_id``` is scraped.

- A new <a title="Abstract ID" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/journal/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands/Abstract_ID_Database_2019-04-24_19_35_1.txt">```abstract_id_database```</a> is prepared for each result page, and is referenced when a new paper is scraped.

- The <a title="Abstract Database" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/journal/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands/Abstract_Database_2019-04-24_19_35.txt">```abstract_database```</a> contains the abstract along with the title, author and a complete URL from where the full text can be downloaded. They are saved in a ```.txt``` file

- A <a title="Status Logger" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/journal/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands/Status_Logger_2019-04-24_19_35.txt" target="_blank">```status_logger```</a> is used to log the sequence of commands in the program.

<i> **Figure 3.2** <a title="Scraper" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/Scraper.py">```Scraper.py```</a> script grabbing the papers from <a title="Springer" href="https://www.link.Springer.com" target="_blank">Springer</a>.</i>

### 3.2 Cleaner:
- The <a title="Cleaner" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Cleaner.py/">```Cleaner.py```</a> cleans the corpus scrapped from the repository, before the  topic models are generated.

- This script creates a clean variant of the ```.txt``` corpus file that is then stored as <a href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/journal/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands/Abstract_Database_2019-04-24_19_35_ANALYTICAL.txt" title="Analytical File">```_ANALYTICAL.txt```</a>, for further analysis and modelling

<i> **Figure 3.3** <a title="Cleaner" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Cleaner.py/">```Cleaner.py```</a> script gets rid of formatting and special characters present in the corpus.</i>

### 3.3 Analyzer:
- The <a title="Analyzer" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Analyzer.py/">```Analyzer.py```</a> analyzes the frequency of different words used in the abstract, and stores it in the form of a <a title="Pandas" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> dataframe.

- It serves as an intermediary between the Scraper and the Visualizer, preparing the scraped data into a <a title="Analyzer CSV file" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/journal/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands/Abstract_Database_2019-04-24_19_35.csv">```.csv```</a>.

- This ```.csv``` file is then passed on to the <a title="Visualizer" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/Visualizer.py">```Visualizer.py```</a> to generate the "Trends" <a href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/journal#53-trends-result-" title="Trends Charts">chart</a>.

<img src="assets/Analyzer.png" alt="Analyzer sorting the frequency of each word occuring in the corpus">

<i>**Figure 3.4** <a title="Analyzer" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Analyzer.py/">```Analyzer.py```</a> script generates this ```.csv``` file for analysis by other parts of the pipeline.</i>

### 3.4 NLP Engine:

- The NLP Engine is used to generate the topic modelling charts for the [Visualizer.py](https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Visualizer.py) script. 

- The language models are generated from the corpus for analysis using <a title="Gensim" href="https://pypi.org/project/gensim/">gensim</a> and <a title="spaCy" href="https://spacy.io">spaCy</a> packages that employ the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/944919.944937" title="LDA Modelling">Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)</a> method <a title="LDA Modelling" href="">[2]</a>.

- The corpus and model generated are then passed to the [Visualizer.py](https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/master/Visualizer.py) script.

- The top modelling chart can be pulled from here [here](https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/journal/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands/Data_Visualization_Topic_Modelling.html).

	**Note:** The <a title="Topic Modelling .html" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/journal/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands/Data_Visualization_Topic_Modelling.html">```.html```</a> file linked above has to be downloaded and opened in a JavaScript enabled browser to be viewed.

### 3.5 Visualizer:

- The <a title="Visualizer" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/Visualizer.py">```Visualizer.py```</a> code is responsible for generating the visualization associated with a specific search, using the <a title="Gensim" href="https://pypi.org/project/gensim/" target="_blank">gensim</a> and <a title="spaCy" href="https://spacy.io" target="_blank">spaCy</a> for research themes and <a title="Matplotlib" href="https://http://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">matplotlib</a> library for the trends.

- The research theme visualization is functional are presented under the <a title="Results Section" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/journal#50-results">5.0 Results</a> section.

- The research themes data visualization is stored as a <a title="Data Visualization" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/journal/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands/Data_Visualization_Topic_Modelling.html">.html file</a> in the LOGS directory and can be viewed in the browser.

To run the code and generate the topic distribution and trend of research graphs:
		
		(Bias) E:\Bias python Bias.py --keywords="Western Ghats" --trends="Conservation"

- This command will scrape the abstracts from <a title="Springer" href="https://link.springer.com/" target="_blank">Springer</a> that are related to "Western Ghats", and calculate the frequency with which the term "Conservation" appears in their abstract.

## 5.0 Results:

Currently, the <a title="LOGS" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/LOGS/" target="_blank">results</a> from the various biodiversity runs are stored as tarballs, in the <a title="LOGS" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/LOGS/" target="_blank">LOGS</a>  folder, primarily to save space.

To view the logs, topic-modelling results & trends chart from the tarballs, run the following commands:

		tar zxvf <log_folder_to_be_unarchived>.tar.gz

**Example:**

To view the logs & results generated from the run on <a title="east Melanesian Islands" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/LOGS/LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands.tar.gz">"East Melanesian Islands"</a>:

		tar zxvf LOG_2019-04-24_19_35_East_Melanesian_Islands.tar.gz

### 5.1 Topic Modelling Results:

The ```NLP_Engine.py``` module creates topic modelling charts such as the one shown below.

<img src='assets/Topics.png' alt='Topic Modelling Chart'>

<i>***Figure 5.1*** Distribution of topics discussed in publications pulled from <a title="Ecology Journals" href="journals.md">8 conservation and ecology themed journals</a></i>.

- Circles indicate topics generated from the ```.txt``` file supplied to the ```NLP_Engine.py```, as part of the ```Bias``` pipeline.
- Each topic is made of a number of top keywords that are seen on the right, with an adjustable relevancy metric on top.
- More details regarding the visualizations and the udnerlying mechanics can be checked out [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/events/illvi2014/papers/sievert-illvi2014.pdf).

### 5.2 Weights and Frequency Results:

<img src = 'assets/WeightsAndFrequency.png' alt= "Weights and Frequncy">

<i>***Figure 5.2*** Here, we plot the variation in the weights and frequency of keywords falling under topic one from the chart <a title="Link to Topic Modelling charts" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/tree/journal/#51-topic-modelling-results">above</a>.</i>

- Here, "weights" is a proxy for the importance of a specific keyword to a highlighted topic. The weight of a keyword is calculated by: i) absolute frequency and, ii) frequency of occurance with other keywords in the same topic.

- Factors i) and ii) result in variable weights being assigned to different keywords and emphasize it's importance in the topic.

### 5.3 Trends Result *:

<img src = "assets/XKCD.png" alt = 'Trends Chart for Eastern '>

<i>***Figure 5.3*** Variation in the frequency of a the term "Conservation" over time in the corpus of text scrapped.</i>

- Here, abstracts pertaining to [Eastern Himalayas](https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/LOGS/LOG_2019-02-27_15_23_Eastern_Himalayas.tar.gz) were scrapped and temporally trend of occurance for "Conservation" was checked.
- The frequency is presented alongisde the bubble for each year on the chart.
- &ast; We are still working on how to effectively present the trends and usage variations temporally. This feature is not part of the main package.
