# Analyzing biases in publications pertaining to the Western Ghats

:warning: <strong>Warning: Code is buggy</strong>:warning:


## Introduction:

- A significant proportion of publications pertaining to the Western Ghats in the <em>pre-independence era</em> of India was motivated by economic benefits of the region.

- A quick search on scientific repositories reveals that most of the scientific publications related to this geographic area are related to the Nilgiri hills, <strong>primarily due to the economic incentives of growing tea in the region.</strong>

- This project is a collaboration with <a title="Vijay" href="https://evolecol.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Vijay Ramesh</a>, <a title="E3B" href="http://e3b.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Ecology, Evolution & Environmental Biology</a> (or E3B for short), <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" title="Columbia University" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>

- This tool is being developed to prove (quantitatively) the existence of these biases.

## Model Overview:
- The model is made up of three parts:
	1.  <a title="Scraper" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Bias/blob/master/Scraper.py">webpage-scraper</a> (Currently the webscraper scrapes only <a href="www.ScienceDirect.com" title="ScienceDirect">ScienceDirect</a>)
	2.  text-analyzer 
	3.  data-visualizer
	
- Only the webscraper is ready as of now (somewhat). The text-analyzer is still under development and work on the data-visualizer is yet to begin. Stay tuned for more developments.
