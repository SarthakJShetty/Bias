# Build-Log

### Date: 28/09/2018
- The Analyzer.py code is ready.
- It can scrape abstracts off of ScienceDirect and store them in the LOGS folder, corresponding to the date when the
script was run.

### Date: 29/09/2018
- Code could not initially scrape multiple pages.
- Added a small checker, to check if the page contains content, and only then scrape IDs and then abstracts.

### Date: 30/09/2018
- Improved the documentation, added a Abstract counter.
- Code had to be modified after ScienceDirect redesign.
- Multiple abstract ID files are now generated.
